Answer to Q5.3:
	
	Yes. We use inverse bilateral filtering for saliency detection. There was a paper about this and I designed an inverse bilteral filter which is run on the boy_smiling.jpg to show the saliency detection using multiple scales of bilateral filter.

Running the Codes (I used a Matlab R2013a)
	
	>>q1    (For the entire First Question)
	>>q2    (For the Histogram Equalization)
	>>q2_2  (For the Histogram Matching using Ramp)
	>>q2_3  (For the Histogram Matching using Step)
	>>q3    (For the National Instruments Image)
	>>q4    (For the Highboost Filtering Question)
	>>q5    (For the bilateral filter on Grayscale face.png)
	>>q5_2  (For the bilateral filter on the Colour Image)
	>> q5_3 (For the inverse bilateral filter as Saliency Detectors)
