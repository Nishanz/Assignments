Q1b) It does not work. Because simple L2 norm cannot recognize the changed values of brightness and contrast.

Q1c) Yes. Because it is invariant to the change in brightness and contrast.

Q1d) Yes. Integral Images does considerably faster.

Q1e) We can use gaussian pyramid scaling to greatly improve the speed of our code. We could do the fourier transform and apply the normxcorr2 function in each of the images.
