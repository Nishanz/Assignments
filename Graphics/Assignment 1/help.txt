Score is displayed as to when collecting the coins
Coins golden colour not rendered due to some problem with the Texture Renderer
Similarly, the pink colour of Pigs and the blue Cannon is not rendered, neither the green of the angry birds coming out due to the problem in texture. Removed in v2 and v3. We can see v1 for the proof of implementation if required.

Dyanmic Generation of Maps

The map, pigs locations etc is entirely renderable and can be randomized, just edit the map.txt and bingo!

Score is displayed too!
Mouse controls implemented.

I guess all requirements are more or less implemented.
