%% Comments
%
% Hence, we gain insights into the structure of the fundamentals of
% Mathematics around us.
% 
% Our natural numbers are polynomials with z=10, decimal numbers are
% polynomials with z=10 but with negative powers allowed too
%
% Also, convolution is equivalent to multiplying polynomials is what we 
% discovered after this tutorial
%
% Hence, convolution emerged as an important operation.
