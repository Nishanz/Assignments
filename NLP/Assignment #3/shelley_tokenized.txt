<s> the complete poetical works of percy bysshe shelley volume 1 oxford edition <\s>
<s> including materials never before printed in any edition of the poems <\s>
<s> edited with textual notes by thomas hutchinson m <\s>
<s> editor of the oxford wordsworth <\s>
<s> this edition of his poetical works contains all shelley's ascertained poems and fragments of verse that have hitherto appeared in print <\s>
<s> in preparing the volume i have worked as far as possible on the principle of recognizing the editio princeps as the primary textual authority <\s>
<s> i have not been content to reprint mrs <\s>
<s> shelley's recension of 1839 or that of any subsequent editor of the poems <\s>
<s> the present text is the result of a fresh collation of the early editions and in every material instance of departure from the wording of those originals the rejected reading has been subjoined in a footnote <\s>
<s> again wherever as in the case of julian and maddalo there has appeared to be good reason for superseding the authority of the editio princeps the fact is announced and the substituted exemplar indicated in the prefatory note <\s>
<s> in the case of a few pieces extant in two or more versions of debatable authority the alternative text or texts will be found at the end of the relevant work ]; but it may be said once for all that this does not pretend to be a variorum edition in the proper sense of the term the textual apparatus does not claim to be exhaustive <\s>
<s> thus i have not thought it necessary to cumber the footnotes with every minute grammatical correction introduced by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley apparently on her own authority into the texts of 1839 nor has it come within the scheme of this edition to record every conjectural emendation adopted or proposed by rossetti and others in recent times <\s>
<s> but it is hoped that up to and including the editions of 1839 at least no important variation of the text has been overlooked <\s>
<s> whenever a reading has been adopted on manuscript authority a reference to the particular source has been added below <\s>
<s> i have been chary of gratuitous interference with the punctuation of the manuscripts and early editions in this direction however some revision was indispensable <\s>
<s> even in his most carefully finished fair copy shelley under punctuates thus in the exquisite autograph hunt ms <\s>
<s> of julian and maddalo mr <\s>
<s> buxton forman the most conservative of editors finds it necessary to supplement shelley's punctuation in no fewer than ninety four places and sometimes punctuates capriciously <\s>
<s> in the very act of transcribing his mind was apt to stray from the work in hand to higher things he would lose himself in contemplating those airy abstractions and lofty visions of which alone he greatly cared to sing to the neglect and detriment of the merely external and formal element of his song <\s>
<s> shelley recked little of the jots and tittles of literary craftsmanship he committed many a small sin against the rules of grammar and certainly paid but a halting attention to the nice distinctions of punctuation <\s>
<s> thus in the early editions a comma occasionally plays the part of a semicolon colons and semicolons seem to be employed interchangeably a semicolon almost invariably appears where nowadays we should employ the dash and lastly the dash itself becomes a point of all work replacing indifferently commas colons semicolons or periods <\s>
<s> inadequate and sometimes haphazard as it is however shelley's punctuation so far as it goes is of great value as an index to his metrical or at times it may be to his rhetorical intention for in shelley's hands punctuation serves rather to mark the rhythmical pause and onflow of the verse or to secure some declamatory effect than to indicate the structure or elucidate the sense <\s>
<s> for this reason the original pointing has been retained save where it tends to obscure or pervert the poet's meaning <\s>
<s> amongst the editor's notes at the end of the volume 3 the reader will find lists of the punctual variations in the longer poems by means of which the supplementary points now added may be identified and the original points which in this edition have been deleted or else replaced by others ascertained in the order of their occurrence <\s>
<s> in the use of capitals shelley's practice has been followed while an attempt has been made to reduce the number of his inconsistencies in this regard <\s>
<s> to have reproduced the spelling of the manuscripts would only have served to divert attention from shelley's poetry to my own ingenuity in disgusting the reader according to the rules of editorial punctilio <\s>
<s> i adapt a phrase or two from the preface to the revolt of islam shelley was neither very accurate nor always consistent in his spelling <\s>
<s> he was to say the truth indifferent about all such matters indeed to one absorbed in the spectacle of a world travailing for lack of the gospel of political justice the study of orthographical niceties must have seemed an occupation for bedlamites <\s>
<s> again as a distinguished critic and editor of shelley professor dowden aptly observes in this connexion 'a great poet is not of an age but for all time <\s>
<s> irregular or antiquated forms such as recieve sacrifize tyger gulph desart falshood and the like can only serve to distract the reader's attention and mar his enjoyment of the verse <\s>
<s> accordingly shelley's eccentricities in this kind have been discarded and his spelling reversed in accordance with modern usage <\s>
<s> all weak preterite forms whether indicatives or participles have been printed with ed rather than t participial adjectives and substantives such as past alone excepted <\s>
<s> in the case of leap which has two preterite forms both employed by shelley see for an example of the longer form the hymn to mercury 18 5 where leaped rhymes with heaped line 1 <\s>
<s> the shorter form rhyming to wept adapt etc occurs more frequently one with the long vowel of the present form the other with a vowel change of course wherever this vowel shortening takes place whether indicated by a corresponding change in the spelling or not t not ed is properly used 'cleave cleft deal dealt etc <\s>
<s> the forms discarded under the general rule laid down above are such as wrackt prankt snatcht kist opprest etc like that of crept from creep' i have not hesitated to print the longer form leaped and the shorter after mr <\s>
<s> henry sweet's example lept in order clearly to indicate the pronunciation intended by shelley <\s>
<s> in the editions the two vowel sounds are confounded under the one spelling leapt <\s>
<s> in a few cases shelley's spelling though unusual or obsolete has been retained <\s>
<s> thus in aethereal paean and one or two more words the ae will be found and airy still appears as aery <\s>
<s> shelley seems to have uniformly written lightening here the word is so printed whenever it is employed as a trisyllable elsewhere the ordinary spelling has been adopted <\s>
<s> not a little has been written about uprest revolt of islam 3 21 5 which has been described as a nonce word deliberately coined by shelley on no better warrant than the exigency of the rhyme <\s>
<s> there can be little doubt that uprest is simply an overlooked misprint for uprist' not by any means a nonce word but a genuine english verbal substantive of regular formation familiar to many from its employment by chaucer <\s>
<s> true the corresponding rhyme words in the passage above referred to are nest possessed breast but a laxity such as nest' 'uprist is quite in shelley's manner <\s>
<s> thus in this very poem we find midst' 'shed'st 6 16 mist' 'rest' 'blest 5 58 loveliest' 'mist' kissed' 'dressed 5 53 <\s>
<s> shelley may have first seen the word in the ancient mariner but he employs it more correctly than coleridge who seems to have mistaken it for a preterite form (= uprose whereas in truth it serves either as the third person singular of the present (= upriseth or as here for the verbal substantive (= uprising <\s>
<s> the editor of shelley to day enters upon a goodly heritage the accumulated gains of a series of distinguished predecessors <\s>
<s> shelley's two editions of 1839 form the nucleus of the present volume and her notes are here reprinted in full but the arrangement of the poems differs to some extent from that followed by her chiefly in respect of queen mab which is here placed at the head of the juvenilia instead of at the forefront of the poems of shelley's maturity <\s>
<s> in 1862 a slender volume of poems and fragments entitled relics of shelley was published by dr <\s>
<s> richard garnett c b a precious sheaf gleaned from the manuscripts preserved at boscombe manor <\s>
<s> the relics constitute a salvage second only in value to the posthumous poems of 1824 <\s>
<s> to the growing mass of shelley's verse yet more material was added in 1870 by mr <\s>
<s> william michael rossetti who edited for moxon the complete poetical works published in that year <\s>
<s> to him we owe in particular a revised and greatly enlarged version of the fragmentary drama of charles i <\s>
<s> but though not seldom successful in restoring the text mr <\s>
<s> rossetti pushed revision beyond the bounds of prudence freely correcting grammatical errors rectifying small inconsistencies in the sense and too lightly adopting conjectural emendations on the grounds of rhyme or metre <\s>
<s> in the course of an article published in the westminster review for july 1870 miss mathilde blind with the aid of material furnished by dr <\s>
<s> garnett was enabled in the words of mr <\s>
<s> buxton forman to supply omissions make authoritative emendations and controvert erroneous changes in mr <\s>
<s> rossetti's work and in the more cautiously edited text of his later edition published by moxon in 1878 may be traced the influence of her strictures <\s>
<s> six years later appeared a variorum edition in which for the first time shelley's text was edited with scientific exactness of method and with a due respect for the authority of the original editions <\s>
<s> it would be difficult indeed to over estimate the gains which have accrued to the lovers of shelley from the strenuous labours of mr <\s>
<s> harry buxton forman c b <\s>
<s> he too has enlarged the body of shelley's poetry mr <\s>
<s> forman's most notable addition is the second part of the daemon of the world which he printed privately in 1876 and included in his library edition of the poetical works published in the same year <\s>
<s> see the list of editions etc <\s>
<s> at the end of volume 3 ); but important as his editions undoubtedly are it may safely be affirmed that his services in this direction constitute the least part of what we owe him <\s>
<s> he has vindicated the authenticity of the text in many places while in many others he has succeeded with the aid of manuscripts in restoring it <\s>
<s> his untiring industry in research his wide bibliographical knowledge and experience above all his accuracy as invariable as it is minute have combined to make him in the words of professor dowden our chief living authority on all that relates to shelley's writings <\s>
<s> his name stands securely linked for all time to shelley's by a long series of notable words including three successive editions 1876 1882 1892 of the poems an edition of the prose remains as well as many minor publications a bibliography the shelley library 1886 and several facsimile reprints of the early issues edited for the shelley society <\s>
<s> to professor dowden whose authoritative biography of the poet published in 1886 was followed in 1890 by an edition of the poems macmillans is due the addition of several pieces belonging to the juvenile period incorporated by him in the pages of the life of shelley <\s>
<s> professor dowden has also been enabled with the aid of the manuscripts placed in his hands to correct the text of the juvenilia in many places <\s>
<s> in 1893 professor george e <\s>
<s> woodberry edited a centenary edition of the complete poetical works in which to quote his own words an attempt is made to summarize the labours of more than half a century on shelley's text and on his biography so far as the biography is bound up with the text <\s>
<s> in this centenary edition the textual variations found in the harvard college manuscripts as well as those in the manuscripts belonging to mr <\s>
<s> frederickson of brooklyn are fully recorded <\s>
<s> professor woodberry's text is conservative on the whole but his revision of the punctuation is drastic and occasionally sacrifices melody to perspicuity <\s>
<s> locock published in a quarto volume of seventy five pages the fruits of a careful scrutiny of the shelley manuscripts now lodged in the bodleian library <\s>
<s> locock succeeded in recovering several inedited fragments of verse and prose <\s>
<s> amongst the poems chiefly concerned in the results of his examination may be named marenghi prince athanase the witch of atlas to constantia the ode to naples and last not least prometheus unbound <\s>
<s> full use has been made in this edition of mr <\s>
<s> locock's collations and the fragments recovered and printed by him are included in the text <\s>
<s> variants derived from the bodleian manuscripts are marked b <\s>
<s> on the state of the text generally and the various quarters in which it lies open to conjectural emendation i cannot do better than quote the following succinct and luminous account from a causerie on the shelley manuscripts in the bodleian library contributed by dr <\s>
<s> richard garnett c b to the columns of the speaker of december 19 1903 from the textual point of view shelley's works may be divided into three classes those published in his lifetime under his own direction those also published in his lifetime but in his absence from the press and those published after his death <\s>
<s> the first class includes queen mab the revolt of islam and alastor with its appendages published in england before his final departure for the continent and the cenci and adonais printed under his own eye at leghorn and pisa respectively <\s>
<s> except for some provoking but corrigible misprints in the revolt of islam and one crucial passage in alastor these poems afford little material for conjectural emendation for the alexandrines now and then left in the middle of stanzas in the revolt of islam must remain untouched as proceeding not from the printer's carelessness but the author's <\s>
<s> the second class poems printed during shelley's lifetime but not under his immediate inspection comprise prometheus unbound and rosalind and helen together with the pieces which accompanied them epipsychidion hellas and swellfoot the tyrant <\s>
<s> the correction of the most important of these the prometheus was the least satisfactory <\s>
<s> shelley though speaking plainly to the publisher rather hints than expresses his dissatisfaction when writing to gisborne the corrector but there is a pretty clear hint when on a subsequent occasion he says to him i have received hellas which is prettily printed and with fewer mistakes than any poem i ever published <\s>
<s> this also was probably not without influence on his determination to have the cenci and adonais printed in italy ... of the third class of shelley's writings those which were first published after his death sufficient facsimiles have been published to prove that trelawny's graphic description of the chaotic state of most of them was really in no respect exaggerated ... the difficulty is much augmented by the fact that these pieces are rarely consecutive but literally disiecti membra poetae scattered through various notebooks in a way to require piecing together as well as deciphering <\s>
<s> the editors of the posthumous poems moreover though diligent according to their light were neither endowed with remarkable acumen nor possessed of the wide knowledge requisite for the full intelligence of so erudite a poet as shelley hence the perpetration of numerous mistakes <\s>
<s> some few of the manuscripts indeed such as those of the witch of atlas julian and maddalo and the lines at naples were beautifully written out for the press in shelley's best hand but their very value and beauty necessitated the ordeal of transcription with disastrous results in several instances <\s>
<s> an entire line dropped out of the lines at naples and although julian and maddalo was extant in more than one very clear copy the printed text had several such sense destroying errors as least for lead <\s>
<s> the corrupt state of the text has stimulated the ingenuity of numerous correctors who have suggested many acute and convincing emendations and some very specious ones which sustained scrutiny has proved untenable <\s>
<s> it should be needless to remark that success has in general been proportionate to the facilities of access to the manuscripts which have only of late become generally available <\s>
<s> if shelley is less fortunate than most modern poets in the purity of his text he is more fortunate than many in the preservation of his manuscripts <\s>
<s> these have not as regards a fair proportion been destroyed or dispersed at auctions but were protected from either fate by their very character as confused memoranda <\s>
<s> as such they remained in the possession of shelley's widow and passed from her to her son and daughter in law <\s>
<s> after sir percy shelley's death lady shelley took the occasion of the erection of the monument to shelley at university college oxford to present certain of the manuscripts to the bodleian library and verse and sculpture form an imperishable memorial of his connection with the university where his residence was so brief and troubled <\s>
<s> garnett proceeds the most important of the bodleian manuscripts is that of prometheus unbound which says mr <\s>
<s> locock has the appearance of being an intermediate draft and also the first copy made <\s>
<s> this should confer considerable authority on its variations from the accepted text as this appears to have been printed from a copy not made by shelley himself <\s>
<s> my prometheus he writes to ollier on september 6 1819 is now being transcribed an expression which he would hardly have used if he had himself been the copyist <\s>
<s> he wished the proofs to be sent to him in italy for correction but to this ollier objected and on may 14 1820 shelley signifies his acquiescence adding however in this case i shall repose trust in your care respecting the correction of the press mr <\s>
<s> gisborne will revise it he heard it recited and will therefore more readily seize any error <\s>
<s> this confidence in the accuracy of gisborne's verbal memory is touching <\s>
<s> from a letter to gisborne on may 26 following it appears that the offer to correct came from him and that shelley sent him two little papers of corrections and additions which were probably made use of or the fact would have been made known <\s>
<s> in the case of additions this may satisfactorily account for apparent omissions in the bodleian manuscript <\s>
<s> gisborne after all did not prove fully up to the mark <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted writes shelley to ollier on november 20 that the errors of the press are so numerous adding i shall send you the list of errata in a day or two <\s>
<s> this was probably the list of errata written by shelley himself from which mrs <\s>
<s> shelley corrected the edition of 1839 in placing queen mab at the head of the juvenilia i have followed the arrangement adopted by mr <\s>
<s> buxton forman in his library edition of 1876 <\s>
<s> i have excluded the wandering jew having failed to satisfy myself of the sufficiency of the grounds on which in certain quarters it is accepted as the work of shelley <\s>
<s> the shorter fragments are printed as in professor dowden's edition of 1890 along with the miscellaneous poems of the years to which they severally belong under titles which are sometimes borrowed from mr <\s>
<s> buxton forman sometimes of my own choosing <\s>
<s> i have added a few brief editor's notes mainly on textual questions at the end of the book <\s>
<s> of the poverty of my work in this direction i am painfully aware but in the present edition the ordinary reader will it is hoped find an authentic complete and accurately printed text and if this be so the principal end and aim of the oxford shelley will have been attained <\s>
<s> i desire cordially to acknowledge the courtesy of mr <\s>
<s> buxton forman c b by whose kind sanction the second part of the daemon the world appears in this volume <\s>
<s> and i would fain express my deep sense of obligation for manifold information and guidance derived from mr <\s>
<s> buxton forman's various editions reprints and other publications especially from the monumental library edition of 1876 <\s>
<s> acknowledgements are also due to the poet's grandson charles e j <\s>
<s> esdaile esq for permission to include the early poems first printed in professor dowden's life of shelley and to mr <\s>
<s> locock for leave to make full use of the material contained in his interesting and stimulating volume <\s>
<s> richard garnett c b and to professor dowden cordial thanks are hereby tendered for good counsel cheerfully bestowed <\s>
<s> to two of the editors of the shelley society reprints mr <\s>
<s> potts both generously communicative collectors i am deeply indebted for the gift or loan of scarce volumes as well as for many kind offices in other ways <\s>
<s> lastly to the staff of the oxford university press my heartiest thanks are owing for their unremitting care in all that relates to the printing and correcting of the sheets <\s>
<s> in a valuable paper notes on passages in shelley contributed to the modern language review october 1905 mr <\s>
<s> bradley discussed amongst other things some fifty places in the text of shelley's verse and indicated certain errors and omissions in this edition <\s>
<s> with the aid of these notes the editor has now carefully revised the text and has in many places adopted the suggestions or conclusions of their accomplished author <\s>
<s> shelley to first collected edition 1839 <\s>
<s> obstacles have long existed to my presenting the public with a perfect edition of shelley's poems <\s>
<s> these being at last happily removed i hasten to fulfil an important duty that of giving the productions of a sublime genius to the world with all the correctness possible and of at the same time detailing the history of those productions as they sprang living and warm from his heart and brain <\s>
<s> i abstain from any remark on the occurrences of his private life except inasmuch as the passions which they engendered inspired his poetry <\s>
<s> this is not the time to relate the truth and i should reject any colouring of the truth <\s>
<s> no account of these events has ever been given at all approaching reality in their details either as regards himself or others nor shall i further allude to them than to remark that the errors of action committed by a man as noble and generous as shelley may as far as he only is concerned be fearlessly avowed by those who loved him in the firm conviction that were they judged impartially his character would stand in fairer and brighter light than that of any contemporary <\s>
<s> whatever faults he had ought to find extenuation among his fellows since they prove him to be human without them the exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something divine <\s>
<s> the qualities that struck any one newly introduced to shelley were first a gentle and cordial goodness that animated his intercourse with warm affection and helpful sympathy <\s>
<s> the other the eagerness and ardour with which he was attached to the cause of human happiness and improvement and the fervent eloquence with which he discussed such subjects <\s>
<s> his conversation was marked by its happy abundance and the beautiful language in which he clothed his poetic ideas and philosophical notions <\s>
<s> to defecate life of its misery and its evil was the ruling passion of his soul he dedicated to it every power of his mind every pulsation of his heart <\s>
<s> he looked on political freedom as the direct agent to effect the happiness of mankind and thus any new sprung hope of liberty inspired a joy and an exultation more intense and wild than he could have felt for any personal advantage <\s>
<s> those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this and it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago nor the persecutions to which they were exposed <\s>
<s> he had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the french revolution and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his views it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive as impetuous and as generous as his should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered <\s>
<s> many advantages attended his birth he spurned them all when balanced with what he considered his duties <\s>
<s> he was generous to imprudence devoted to heroism <\s>
<s> these characteristics breathe throughout his poetry <\s>
<s> the struggle for human weal the resolution firm to martyrdom the impetuous pursuit the glad triumph in good the determination not to despair such were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim <\s>
<s> in addition to these his poems may be divided into two classes the purely imaginative and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart <\s>
<s> among the former may be classed the witch of atlas adonais and his latest composition left imperfect the triumph of life <\s>
<s> in the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy and luxuriated in every idea as it rose in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of life a clinging to the subtler inner spirit rather than to the outward form a curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception <\s>
<s> the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects <\s>
<s> shelley's conception of love was exalted absorbing allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature and warmed by earnest passion such it appears when he gave it a voice in verse <\s>
<s> yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings except when highly idealized and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unfinished and they were never seen by me till after i had lost him <\s>
<s> others as for instance rosalind and helen and lines written among the euganean hills i found among his papers by chance and with some difficulty urged him to complete them <\s>
<s> there are others such as the ode to the skylark and the cloud which in the opinion of many critics bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions <\s>
<s> they were written as his mind prompted listening to the carolling of the bird aloft in the azure sky of italy or marking the cloud as it sped across the heavens while he floated in his boat on the thames <\s>
<s> no poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration <\s>
<s> his extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his intellectual pursuits and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects as well as to his internal sensations <\s>
<s> such a gift is among the sad vicissitudes of human life the disappointments we meet and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors fraught with pain to escape from such he delivered up his soul to poetry and felt happy when he sheltered himself from the influence of human sympathies in the wildest regions of fancy <\s>
<s> his imagination has been termed too brilliant his thoughts too subtle <\s>
<s> he loved to idealize reality and this is a taste shared by few <\s>
<s> we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions for this gratifies our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind <\s>
<s> in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible <\s>
<s> this did not result from imitation for it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study <\s>
<s> he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of no more brilliant composition than plato's praise of love translated by shelley <\s>
<s> to return to his own poetry <\s>
<s> the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself as a child burdens itself with spring flowers thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate <\s>
<s> the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached <\s>
<s> there is much however that speaks to the many <\s>
<s> when he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure which entwined with his nature as they were he did with difficulty no poet ever expressed in sweeter more heart reaching or more passionate verse the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul <\s>
<s> a wise friend once wrote to shelley you are still very young and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so <\s>
<s> it is seldom that the young know what youth is till they have got beyond its period and time was not given him to attain this knowledge <\s>
<s> it must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote he had not completed his nine and twentieth year when he died <\s>
<s> the calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth <\s>
<s> through life also he was a martyr to ill health and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations <\s>
<s> perfectly gentle and forbearing in manner he suffered a good deal of internal irritability or rather excitement and his fortitude to bear was almost always on the stretch and thus during a short life he had gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is protracted <\s>
<s> if i die to morrow he said on the eve of his unanticipated death i have lived to be older than my father <\s>
<s> the weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily you read his sufferings in his attenuated frame while you perceived the mastery he held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes <\s>
<s> he died and the world showed no outward sign <\s>
<s> but his influence over mankind though slow in growth is fast augmenting and in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles <\s>
<s> his spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that though late his exertions were not made in vain and in the progress of the liberty he so fondly loved <\s>
<s> he died and his place among those who knew him intimately has never been filled up <\s>
<s> he walked beside them like a spirit of good to comfort and benefit to enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of genius to cheer it with his sympathy and love <\s>
<s> any one once attached to shelley must feel all other affections however true and fond as wasted on barren soil in comparison <\s>
<s> it is our best consolation to know that such a pure minded and exalted being was once among us and now exists where we hope one day to join him although the intolerant in their blindness poured down anathemas the spirit of good who can judge the heart never rejected him <\s>
<s> in the notes appended to the poems i have endeavoured to narrate the origin and history of each <\s>
<s> the loss of nearly all letters and papers which refer to his early life renders the execution more imperfect than it would otherwise have been <\s>
<s> i have however the liveliest recollection of all that was done and said during the period of my knowing him <\s>
<s> every impression is as clear as if stamped yesterday and i have no apprehension of any mistake in my statements as far as they go <\s>
<s> in other respects i am indeed incompetent but i feel the importance of the task and regard it as my most sacred duty <\s>
<s> i endeavour to fulfil it in a manner he would himself approve and hope in this publication to lay the first stone of a monument due to shelley's genius his sufferings and his virtues se al seguir son tarda forse avverra che l bel nome gentile consacrero con questa stanca penna <\s>
<s> postscript in second edition of 1839 <\s>
<s> in revising this new edition and carefully consulting shelley's scattered and confused papers i found a few fragments which had hitherto escaped me and was enabled to complete a few poems hitherto left unfinished <\s>
<s> what at one time escapes the searching eye dimmed by its own earnestness becomes clear at a future period <\s>
<s> by the aid of a friend i also present some poems complete and correct which hitherto have been defaced by various mistakes and omissions <\s>
<s> it was suggested that the poem to the queen of my heart was falsely attributed to shelley <\s>
<s> i certainly find no trace of it among his papers and as those of his intimate friends whom i have consulted never heard of it i omit it <\s>
<s> two poems are added of some length swellfoot the tyrant and peter bell the third <\s>
<s> i have mentioned the circumstances under which they were written in the notes and need only add that they are conceived in a very different spirit from shelley's usual compositions <\s>
<s> they are specimens of the burlesque and fanciful but although they adopt a familiar style and homely imagery there shine through the radiance of the poet's imagination the earnest views and opinions of the politician and the moralist <\s>
<s> at my request the publisher has restored the omitted passages of queen mab <\s>
<s> i now present this edition as a complete collection of my husband's poetical works and i do not foresee that i can hereafter add to or take away a word or line <\s>

<s> to the volume of posthumous poems published in 1824 <\s>
<s> in nobil sangue vita umile e queta ed in alto intelletto un puro core frutto senile in sul giovenil fibre e in aspetto pensoso anima lieta petrarca <\s>
<s> it had been my wish on presenting the public with the posthumous poems of mr <\s>
<s> shelley to have accompanied them by a biographical notice as it appeared to me that at this moment a narration of the events of my husband's life would come more gracefully from other hands than mine i applied to mr <\s>
<s> the distinguished friendship that mr <\s>
<s> shelley felt for him and the enthusiastic affection with which mr <\s>
<s> leigh hunt clings to his friend's memory seemed to point him out as the person best calculated for such an undertaking <\s>
<s> his absence from this country which prevented our mutual explanation has unfortunately rendered my scheme abortive <\s>
<s> i do not doubt but that on some other occasion he will pay this tribute to his lost friend and sincerely regret that the volume which i edit has not been honoured by its insertion <\s>
<s> the comparative solitude in which mr <\s>
<s> shelley lived was the occasion that he was personally known to few and his fearless enthusiasm in the cause which he considered the most sacred upon earth the improvement of the moral and physical state of mankind was the chief reason why he like other illustrious reformers was pursued by hatred and calumny <\s>
<s> no man was ever more devoted than he to the endeavour of making those around him happy no man ever possessed friends more unfeignedly attached to him <\s>
<s> the ungrateful world did not feel his loss and the gap it made seemed to close as quickly over his memory as the murderous sea above his living frame <\s>
<s> hereafter men will lament that his transcendent powers of intellect were extinguished before they had bestowed on them their choicest treasures <\s>

<s> his life was spent in the contemplation of nature in arduous study or in acts of kindness and affection <\s>
<s> he was an elegant scholar and a profound metaphysician without possessing much scientific knowledge he was unrivalled in the justness and extent of his observations on natural objects he knew every plant by its name and was familiar with the history and habits of every production of the earth he could interpret without a fault each appearance in the sky and the varied phenomena of heaven and earth filled him with deep emotion <\s>

<s> ill health and continual pain preyed upon his powers and the solitude in which we lived particularly on our first arrival in italy although congenial to his feelings must frequently have weighed upon his spirits those beautiful and affecting lines written in dejection near naples were composed at such an interval but when in health his spirits were buoyant and youthful to an extraordinary degree <\s>
<s> such was his love for nature that every page of his poetry is associated in the minds of his friends with the loveliest scenes of the countries which he inhabited <\s>
<s> in early life he visited the most beautiful parts of this country and ireland <\s>
<s> afterwards the alps of switzerland became his inspirers <\s>
<s> prometheus unbound was written among the deserted and flower grown ruins of rome and when he made his home under the pisan hills their roofless recesses harboured him as he composed the witch of atlas adonais and hellas <\s>
<s> in the wild but beautiful bay of spezzia the winds and waves which he loved became his playmates <\s>
<s> his days were chiefly spent on the water the management of his boat its alterations and improvements were his principal occupation <\s>
<s> at night when the unclouded moon shone on the calm sea he often went alone in his little shallop to the rocky caves that bordered it and sitting beneath their shelter wrote the triumph of life the last of his productions <\s>
<s> the beauty but strangeness of this lonely place the refined pleasure which he felt in the companionship of a few selected friends our entire sequestration from the rest of the world all contributed to render this period of his life one of continued enjoyment <\s>
<s> i am convinced that the two months we passed there were the happiest which he had ever known his health even rapidly improved and he was never better than when i last saw him full of spirits and joy embark for leghorn that he might there welcome leigh hunt to italy <\s>

<s> i must add a few words concerning the contents of this volume <\s>
<s> julian and maddalo the witch of atlas and most of the translations were written some years ago and with the exception of the cyclops and the scenes from the magico prodigioso may be considered as having received the author's ultimate corrections <\s>
<s> the triumph of life was his last work and was left in so unfinished a state that i arranged it in its present form with great difficulty <\s>
<s> all his poems which were scattered in periodical works are collected in this volume and i have added a reprint of alastor or the spirit of solitude the difficulty with which a copy can be obtained is the cause of its republication <\s>
<s> many of the miscellaneous poems written on the spur of the occasion and never retouched i found among his manuscript books and have carefully copied <\s>
<s> i have subjoined whenever i have been able the date of their composition <\s>
<s> i do not know whether the critics will reprehend the insertion of some of the most imperfect among them but i frankly own that i have been more actuated by the fear lest any monument of his genius should escape me than the wish of presenting nothing but what was complete to the fastidious reader <\s>
<s> i feel secure that the lovers of shelley's poetry who know how more than any poet of the present day every line and word he wrote is instinct with peculiar beauty will pardon and thank me i consecrate this volume to them <\s>

<s> or is it but that downy winged slumbers have charmed their nurse coy silence near her lids to watch their own repose <\s>
<s> 25 will they when morning's beam flows through those wells of light seek far from noise and day some western cave where woods and streams with soft and pausing winds a lulling murmur weave 30 ianthe doth not sleep the dreamless sleep of death nor in her moonlight chamber silently doth henry hear her regular pulses throb or mark her delicate cheek 35 with interchange of hues mock the broad moon outwatching weary night without assured reward <\s>
<s> her dewy eyes are closed on their translucent lids whose texture fine 40 scarce hides the dark blue orbs that burn below with unapparent fire the baby sleep is pillowed her golden tresses shade the bosom's stainless pride 45 twining like tendrils of the parasite around a marble column <\s>

<s> tis like a wondrous strain that sweeps around a lonely ruin 50 when west winds sigh and evening waves respond in whispers from the shore tis wilder than the unmeasured notes which from the unseen lyres of dells and groves the genii of the breezes sweep <\s>
<s> 55 floating on waves of music and of light the chariot of the daemon of the world descends in silent power its shape reposed within slight as some cloud that catches but the palest tinge of day 60 when evening yields to night bright as that fibrous woof when stars indue its transitory robe <\s>
<s> four shapeless shadows bright and beautiful draw that strange car of glory reins of light 65 check their unearthly speed they stop and fold their wings of braided air the daemon leaning from the ethereal car gazed on the slumbering maid <\s>
<s> human eye hath ne'er beheld 70 a shape so wild so bright so beautiful as that which o'er the maiden's charmed sleep waving a starry wand hung like a mist of light <\s>
<s> such sounds as breathed around like odorous winds 75 of wakening spring arose filling the chamber and the moonlight sky <\s>
<s> maiden the world's supremest spirit beneath the shadow of her wings folds all thy memory doth inherit 80 from ruin of divinest things feelings that lure thee to betray and light of thoughts that pass away <\s>
<s> for thou hast earned a mighty boon the truths which wisest poets see 85 dimly thy mind may make its own rewarding its own majesty entranced in some diviner mood of self oblivious solitude <\s>
<s> custom and faith and power thou spurnest 90 from hate and awe thy heart is free ardent and pure as day thou burnest for dark and cold mortality a living light to cheer it long the watch fires of the world among <\s>
<s> 95 therefore from nature's inner shrine where gods and fiends in worship bend majestic spirit be it thine the flame to seize the veil to rend where the vast snake eternity 100 in charmed sleep doth ever lie <\s>

<s> it ceased and from the mute and moveless frame a radiant spirit arose all beautiful in naked purity <\s>
<s> 110 robed in its human hues it did ascend disparting as it went the silver clouds it moved towards the car and took its seat beside the daemon shape <\s>
<s> obedient to the sweep of aery song 115 the mighty ministers unfurled their prismy wings <\s>
<s> the magic car moved on the night was fair innumerable stars studded heaven's dark blue vault 120 the eastern wave grew pale with the first smile of morn <\s>
<s> the magic car moved on <\s>
<s> from the swift sweep of wings the atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew 125 and where the burning wheels eddied above the mountain's loftiest peak was traced a line of lightning <\s>
<s> now far above a rock the utmost verge of the wide earth it flew 130 the rival of the andes whose dark brow frowned o'er the silver sea <\s>
<s> far far below the chariot's stormy path calm as a slumbering babe tremendous ocean lay <\s>
<s> 135 its broad and silent mirror gave to view the pale and waning stars the chariot's fiery track and the grey light of morn tingeing those fleecy clouds 140 that cradled in their folds the infant dawn <\s>
<s> the chariot seemed to fly through the abyss of an immense concave radiant with million constellations tinged with shades of infinite colour 145 and semicircled with a belt flashing incessant meteors <\s>
<s> as they approached their goal the winged shadows seemed to gather speed <\s>
<s> the sea no longer was distinguished earth 150 appeared a vast and shadowy sphere suspended in the black concave of heaven with the sun's cloudless orb whose rays of rapid light parted around the chariot's swifter course 155 and fell like ocean's feathery spray dashed from the boiling surge before a vessel's prow <\s>
<s> the magic car moved on <\s>
<s> earth's distant orb appeared 160 the smallest light that twinkles in the heavens whilst round the chariot's way innumerable systems widely rolled and countless spheres diffused an ever varying glory <\s>
<s> 165 it was a sight of wonder <\s>
<s> some were horned and like the moon's argentine crescent hung in the dark dome of heaven some did shed a clear mild beam like hesperus while the sea yet glows with fading sunlight others dashed 170 athwart the night with trains of bickering fire like sphered worlds to death and ruin driven some shone like stars and as the chariot passed bedimmed all other light <\s>
<s> here 175 in this interminable wilderness of worlds at whose involved immensity even soaring fancy staggers here is thy fitting temple <\s>

<s> thou imperishable as this glorious scene here is thy fitting temple <\s>
<s> if solitude hath ever led thy steps to the shore of the immeasurable sea 190 and thou hast lingered there until the sun's broad orb seemed resting on the fiery line of ocean thou must have marked the braided webs of gold that without motion hang 195 over the sinking sphere thou must have marked the billowy mountain clouds edged with intolerable radiancy towering like rocks of jet above the burning deep 200 and yet there is a moment when the sun's highest point peers like a star o'er ocean's western edge when those far clouds of feathery purple gleam like fairy lands girt by some heavenly sea 205 then has thy rapt imagination soared where in the midst of all existing things the temple of the mightiest daemon stands <\s>
<s> yet not the golden islands that gleam amid yon flood of purple light 210 nor the feathery curtains that canopy the sun's resplendent couch nor the burnished ocean waves paving that gorgeous dome so fair so wonderful a sight 215 as the eternal temple could afford <\s>

<s> 220 yet likest evening's vault that faery hall as heaven low resting on the wave it spread its floors of flashing light its vast and azure dome and on the verge of that obscure abyss 225 where crystal battlements o'erhang the gulf of the dark world ten thousand spheres diffuse their lustre through its adamantine gates <\s>
<s> the magic car no longer moved the daemon and the spirit 230 entered the eternal gates <\s>
<s> those clouds of aery gold that slept in glittering billows beneath the azure canopy with the ethereal footsteps trembled not 235 while slight and odorous mists floated to strains of thrilling melody through the vast columns and the pearly shrines <\s>

<s> there far as the remotest line that limits swift imagination's flight <\s>
<s> unending orbs mingled in mazy motion immutably fulfilling 245 eternal nature's law <\s>

<s> each with undeviating aim 250 in eloquent silence through the depths of space pursued its wondrous way awhile the spirit paused in ecstasy <\s>

<s> with bosoms bare and bowed heads and false looks of true submission as the sphere rolled by <\s>
<s> brooking no eye to witness their foul shame 280 which human hearts must feel while human tongues tremble to speak they did rage horribly breathing in self contempt fierce blasphemies against the daemon of the world and high hurling their armed hands where the pure spirit 285 serene and inaccessibly secure stood on an isolated pinnacle <\s>

<s> shelley is responsible preface <\s>
<s> the poem entitled alastor may be considered as allegorical of one of the most interesting situations of the human mind <\s>
<s> it represents a youth of uncorrupted feelings and adventurous genius led forth by an imagination inflamed and purified through familiarity with all that is excellent and majestic to the contemplation of the universe <\s>
<s> he drinks deep of the fountains of knowledge and is still insatiate <\s>
<s> the magnificence and beauty of the external world sinks profoundly into the frame of his conceptions and affords to their modifications at variety not to be exhausted <\s>
<s> so long as it is possible for his desires to point towards objects thus infinite and unmeasured he is joyous and tranquil and self possessed <\s>
<s> but the period arrives when these objects cease to suffice <\s>
<s> his mind is at length suddenly awakened and thirsts for intercourse with an intelligence similar to itself <\s>
<s> he images to himself the being whom he loves <\s>
<s> conversant with speculations of the sublimest and most perfect natures the vision in which he embodies his own imaginations unites all of wonderful or wise or beautiful which the poet the philosopher or the lover could depicture <\s>
<s> the intellectual faculties the imagination the functions of sense have their respective requisitions on the sympathy of corresponding powers in other human beings <\s>
<s> the poet is represented as uniting these requisitions and attaching them to a single image <\s>
<s> he seeks in vain for a prototype of his conception <\s>
<s> blasted by his disappointment he descends to an untimely grave <\s>

<s> hither the poet came <\s>
<s> his eyes beheld their own wan light through the reflected lines 470 of his thin hair distinct in the dark depth of that still fountain as the human heart gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave sees its own treacherous likeness there <\s>

<s> a spirit seemed to stand beside him clothed in no bright robes 480 of shadowy silver or enshrining light borrowed from aught the visible world affords of grace or majesty or mystery but undulating woods and silent well and leaping rivulet and evening gloom 485 now deepening the dark shades for speech assuming held commune with him as if he and it were all that was only ... when his regard was raised by intense pensiveness ... two eyes two starry eyes hung in the gloom of thought 490 and seemed with their serene and azure smiles to beckon him <\s>
<s> obedient to the light that shone within his soul he went pursuing the windings of the dell the rivulet wanton and wild through many a green ravine 495 beneath the forest flowed <\s>
<s> sometimes it fell among the moss with hollow harmony dark and profound <\s>

<s> for as fast years flow away the smooth brow gathers and the hair grows thin and white and where irradiate dewy eyes 535 had shone gleam stony orbs so from his steps bright flowers departed and the beautiful shade of the green groves with all their odorous winds and musical motions <\s>

<s> where the pass expands 550 its stony jaws the abrupt mountain breaks and seems with its accumulated crags to overhang the world for wide expand beneath the wan stars and descending moon islanded seas blue mountains mighty streams 555 dim tracts and vast robed in the lustrous gloom of leaden coloured even and fiery hills mingling their flames with twilight on the verge of the remote horizon <\s>

<s> alastor is written in a very different tone from queen mab <\s>
<s> in the latter shelley poured out all the cherished speculations of his youth all the irrepressible emotions of sympathy censure and hope to which the present suffering and what he considers the proper destiny of his fellow creatures gave birth <\s>
<s> alastor on the contrary contains an individual interest only <\s>
<s> a very few years with their attendant events had checked the ardour of shelley's hopes though he still thought them well grounded and that to advance their fulfilment was the noblest task man could achieve <\s>
<s> this is neither the time nor place to speak of the misfortunes that chequered his life <\s>
<s> it will be sufficient to say that in all he did he at the time of doing it believed himself justified to his own conscience while the various ills of poverty and loss of friends brought home to him the sad realities of life <\s>
<s> physical suffering had also considerable influence in causing him to turn his eyes inward inclining him rather to brood over the thoughts and emotions of his own soul than to glance abroad and to make as in queen mab the whole universe the object and subject of his song <\s>
<s> in the spring of 1815 an eminent physician pronounced that he was dying rapidly of a consumption abscesses were formed on his lungs and he suffered acute spasms <\s>
<s> suddenly a complete change took place and though through life he was a martyr to pain and debility every symptom of pulmonary disease vanished <\s>
<s> his nerves which nature had formed sensitive to an unexampled degree were rendered still more susceptible by the state of his health <\s>
<s> as soon as the peace of 1814 had opened the continent he went abroad <\s>
<s> he visited some of the more magnificent scenes of switzerland and returned to england from lucerne by the reuss and the rhine <\s>

<s> the poem which i now present to the world is an attempt from which i scarcely dare to expect success and in which a writer of established fame might fail without disgrace <\s>
<s> it is an experiment on the temper of the public mind as to how far a thirst for a happier condition of moral and political society survives among the enlightened and refined the tempests which have shaken the age in which we live <\s>
<s> i have sought to enlist the harmony of metrical language the ethereal combinations of the fancy the rapid and subtle transitions of human passion all those elements which essentially compose a poem in the cause of a liberal and comprehensive morality and in the view of kindling within the bosoms of my readers a virtuous enthusiasm for those doctrines of liberty and justice that faith and hope in something good which neither violence nor misrepresentation nor prejudice can ever totally extinguish among mankind <\s>
<s> for this purpose i have chosen a story of human passion in its most universal character diversified with moving and romantic adventures and appealing in contempt of all artificial opinions or institutions to the common sympathies of every human breast <\s>
<s> i have made no attempt to recommend the motives which i would substitute for those at present governing mankind by methodical and systematic argument <\s>
<s> i would only awaken the feelings so that the reader should see the beauty of true virtue and be incited to those inquiries which have led to my moral and political creed and that of some of the sublimest intellects in the world <\s>
<s> the poem therefore with the exception of the first canto which is purely introductory is narrative not didactic <\s>
<s> it is a succession of pictures illustrating the growth and progress of individual mind aspiring after excellence and devoted to the love of mankind its influence in refining and making pure the most daring and uncommon impulses of the imagination the understanding and the senses its impatience at all the oppressions which are done under the sun its tendency to awaken public hope and to enlighten and improve mankind the rapid effects of the application of that tendency the awakening of an immense nation from their slavery and degradation to a true sense of moral dignity and freedom the bloodless dethronement of their oppressors and the unveiling of the religious frauds by which they had been deluded into submission the tranquillity of successful patriotism and the universal toleration and benevolence of true philanthropy the treachery and barbarity of hired soldiers vice not the object of punishment and hatred but kindness and pity the faithlessness of tyrants the confederacy of the rulers of the world and the restoration of the expelled dynasty by foreign arms the massacre and extermination of the patriots and the victory of established power the consequences of legitimate despotism civil war famine plague superstition and an utter extinction of the domestic affections the judicial murder of the advocates of liberty the temporary triumph of oppression that secure earnest of its final and inevitable fall the transient nature of ignorance and error and the eternity of genius and virtue <\s>
<s> such is the series of delineations of which the poem consists <\s>
<s> and if the lofty passions with which it has been my scope to distinguish this story shall not excite in the reader a generous impulse an ardent thirst for excellence an interest profound and strong such as belongs to no meaner desires let not the failure be imputed to a natural unfitness for human sympathy in these sublime and animating themes <\s>
<s> it is the business of the poet to communicate to others the pleasure and the enthusiasm arising out of those images and feelings in the vivid presence of which within his own mind consists at once his inspiration and his reward <\s>
<s> the panic which like an epidemic transport seized upon all classes of men during the excesses consequent upon the french revolution is gradually giving place to sanity <\s>
<s> it has ceased to be believed that whole generations of mankind ought to consign themselves to a hopeless inheritance of ignorance and misery because a nation of men who had been dupes and slaves for centuries were incapable of conducting themselves with the wisdom and tranquillity of freemen so soon as some of their fetters were partially loosened <\s>
<s> that their conduct could not have been marked by any other characters than ferocity and thoughtlessness is the historical fact from which liberty derives all its recommendations and falsehood the worst features of its deformity <\s>
<s> there is a reflux in the tide of human things which bears the shipwrecked hopes of men into a secure haven after the storms are past <\s>
<s> methinks those who now live have survived an age of despair <\s>
<s> the french revolution may be considered as one of those manifestations of a general state of feeling among civilised mankind produced by a defect of correspondence between the knowledge existing in society and the improvement or gradual abolition of political institutions <\s>
<s> the year 1788 may be assumed as the epoch of one of the most important crises produced by this feeling <\s>
<s> the sympathies connected with that event extended to every bosom <\s>
<s> the most generous and amiable natures were those which participated the most extensively in these sympathies <\s>
<s> but such a degree of unmingled good was expected as it was impossible to realise <\s>
<s> if the revolution had been in every respect prosperous then misrule and superstition would lose half their claims to our abhorrence as fetters which the captive can unlock with the slightest motion of his fingers and which do not eat with poisonous rust into the soul <\s>
<s> the revulsion occasioned by the atrocities of the demagogues and the re establishment of successive tyrannies in france was terrible and felt in the remotest corner of the civilised world <\s>
<s> could they listen to the plea of reason who had groaned under the calamities of a social state according to the provisions of which one man riots in luxury whilst another famishes for want of bread <\s>
<s> can he who the day before was a trampled slave suddenly become liberal minded forbearing and independent <\s>
<s> this is the consequence of the habits of a state of society to be produced by resolute perseverance and indefatigable hope and long suffering and long believing courage and the systematic efforts of generations of men of intellect and virtue <\s>
<s> such is the lesson which experience teaches now <\s>
<s> but on the first reverses of hope in the progress of french liberty the sanguine eagerness for good overleaped the solution of these questions and for a time extinguished itself in the unexpectedness of their result <\s>
<s> thus many of the most ardent and tender hearted of the worshippers of public good have been morally ruined by what a partial glimpse of the events they deplored appeared to show as the melancholy desolation of all their cherished hopes <\s>
<s> hence gloom and misanthropy have become the characteristics of the age in which we live the solace of a disappointment that unconsciously finds relief only in the wilful exaggeration of its own despair <\s>
<s> this influence has tainted the literature of the age with the hopelessness of the minds from which it flows <\s>
<s> metaphysics i ought to except sir w <\s>
<s> drummond's academical questions a volume of very acute and powerful metaphysical criticism and inquiries into moral and political science have become little else than vain attempts to revive exploded superstitions or sophisms like those of mr <\s>
<s> malthus it is remarkable as a symptom of the revival of public hope that mr <\s>
<s> malthus has assigned in the later editions of his work an indefinite dominion to moral restraint over the principle of population <\s>
<s> this concession answers all the inferences from his doctrine unfavourable to human improvement and reduces the essay on population to a commentary illustrative of the unanswerableness of political justice calculated to lull the oppressors of mankind into a security of everlasting triumph <\s>
<s> our works of fiction and poetry have been overshadowed by the same infectious gloom <\s>
<s> but mankind appear to me to be emerging from their trance <\s>
<s> i am aware methinks of a slow gradual silent change <\s>
<s> in that belief i have composed the following poem <\s>
<s> i do not presume to enter into competition with our greatest contemporary poets <\s>
<s> yet i am unwilling to tread in the footsteps of any who have preceded me <\s>
<s> i have sought to avoid the imitation of any style of language or versification peculiar to the original minds of which it is the character designing that even if what i have produced be worthless it should still be properly my own <\s>
<s> nor have i permitted any system relating to mere words to divert the attention of the reader from whatever interest i may have succeeded in creating to my own ingenuity in contriving to disgust them according to the rules of criticism <\s>
<s> i have simply clothed my thoughts in what appeared to me the most obvious and appropriate language <\s>
<s> a person familiar with nature and with the most celebrated productions of the human mind can scarcely err in following the instinct with respect to selection of language produced by that familiarity <\s>
<s> there is an education peculiarly fitted for a poet without which genius and sensibility can hardly fill the circle of their capacities <\s>
<s> no education indeed can entitle to this appellation a dull and unobservant mind or one though neither dull nor unobservant in which the channels of communication between thought and expression have been obstructed or closed <\s>
<s> how far it is my fortune to belong to either of the latter classes i cannot know <\s>
<s> i aspire to be something better <\s>
<s> the circumstances of my accidental education have been favourable to this ambition <\s>
<s> i have been familiar from boyhood with mountains and lakes and the sea and the solitude of forests danger which sports upon the brink of precipices has been my playmate <\s>
<s> i have trodden the glaciers of the alps and lived under the eye of mont blanc <\s>
<s> i have been a wanderer among distant fields <\s>
<s> i have sailed down mighty rivers and seen the sun rise and set and the stars come forth whilst i have sailed night and day down a rapid stream among mountains <\s>
<s> i have seen populous cities and have watched the passions which rise and spread and sink and change amongst assembled multitudes of men <\s>
<s> i have seen the theatre of the more visible ravages of tyranny and war cities and villages reduced to scattered groups of black and roofless houses and the naked inhabitants sitting famished upon their desolated thresholds <\s>
<s> i have conversed with living men of genius <\s>
<s> the poetry of ancient greece and rome and modern italy and our own country has been to me like external nature a passion and an enjoyment <\s>
<s> such are the sources from which the materials for the imagery of my poem have been drawn <\s>
<s> i have considered poetry in its most comprehensive sense and have read the poets and the historians and the metaphysicians in this sense there may be such a thing as perfectibility in works of fiction notwithstanding the concession often made by the advocates of human improvement that perfectibility is a term applicable only to science whose writings have been accessible to me and have looked upon the beautiful and majestic scenery of the earth as common sources of those elements which it is the province of the poet to embody and combine <\s>
<s> yet the experience and the feelings to which i refer do not in themselves constitute men poets but only prepares them to be the auditors of those who are <\s>
<s> how far i shall be found to possess that more essential attribute of poetry the power of awakening in others sensations like those which animate my own bosom is that which to speak sincerely i know not and which with an acquiescent and contented spirit i expect to be taught by the effect which i shall produce upon those whom i now address <\s>
<s> i have avoided as i have said before the imitation of any contemporary style <\s>
<s> but there must be a resemblance which does not depend upon their own will between all the writers of any particular age <\s>
<s> they cannot escape from subjection to a common influence which arises out of an infinite combination of circumstances belonging to the times in which they live though each is in a degree the author of the very influence by which his being is thus pervaded <\s>
<s> thus the tragic poets of the age of pericles the italian revivers of ancient learning those mighty intellects of our own country that succeeded the reformation the translators of the bible shakespeare spenser the dramatists of the reign of elizabeth and lord bacon milton stands alone in the age which he illumined ); the colder spirits of the interval that succeeded all resemble each other and differ from every other in their several classes <\s>
<s> in this view of things ford can no more be called the imitator of shakespeare than shakespeare the imitator of ford <\s>
<s> there were perhaps few other points of resemblance between these two men than that which the universal and inevitable influence of their age produced <\s>
<s> and this is an influence which neither the meanest scribbler nor the sublimest genius of any era can escape and which i have not attempted to escape <\s>
<s> i have adopted the stanza of spenser a measure inexpressibly beautiful not because i consider it a finer model of poetical harmony than the blank verse of shakespeare and milton but because in the latter there is no shelter for mediocrity you must either succeed or fail <\s>
<s> this perhaps an aspiring spirit should desire <\s>
<s> but i was enticed also by the brilliancy and magnificence of sound which a mind that has been nourished upon musical thoughts can produce by a just and harmonious arrangement of the pauses of this measure <\s>
<s> yet there will be found some instances where i have completely failed in this attempt and one which i here request the reader to consider as an erratum where there is left most inadvertently an alexandrine in the middle of a stanza <\s>
<s> but in this as in every other respect i have written fearlessly <\s>
<s> it is the misfortune of this age that its writers too thoughtless of immortality are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame <\s>
<s> they write with the fear of reviews before their eyes <\s>
<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>
<s> i have sought therefore to write as i believe that homer shakespeare and milton wrote with an utter disregard of anonymous censure <\s>
<s> i am certain that calumny and misrepresentation though it may move me to compassion cannot disturb my peace <\s>
<s> i shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak <\s>
<s> i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public <\s>
<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>
<s> it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great <\s>
<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>
<s> the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself <\s>
<s> the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own <\s>
<s> in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations <\s>
<s> there is no quarter given to revenge or envy or prejudice <\s>
<s> love is celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should govern the moral world <\s>
<s> there is no danger to a man that knows what life and death is there's not any law exceeds his knowledge neither is it lawful that he should stoop to any other law chapman <\s>
<s> so now my summer task is ended mary and i return to thee mine own heart's home as to his queen some victor knight of faery earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome nor thou disdain that ere my fame become 5 a star among the stars of mortal night if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom its doubtful promise thus i would unite with thy beloved name thou child of love and light <\s>
<s> the toil which stole from thee so many an hour 10 is ended and the fruit is at thy feet <\s>
<s> no longer where the woods to frame a bower with interlaced branches mix and meet or where with sound like many voices sweet waterfalls leap among wild islands green 15 which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat of moss grown trees and weeds shall i be seen but beside thee where still my heart has ever been <\s>
<s> thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass <\s>
<s> 20 i do remember well the hour which burst my spirit's sleep <\s>
<s> a fresh may dawn it was when i walked forth upon the glittering grass and wept i knew not why until there rose from the near schoolroom voices that alas <\s>
<s> 25 were but one echo from a world of woes the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes <\s>
<s> and then i clasped my hands and looked around but none was near to mock my streaming eyes which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground 30 so without shame i spake i will be wise and just and free and mild if in me lies such power for i grow weary to behold the selfish and the strong still tyrannise without reproach or check <\s>
<s> i then controlled 35 my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold <\s>
<s> and from that hour did i with earnest thought heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught i cared to learn but from that secret store 40 wrought linked armour for my soul before it might walk forth to war among mankind thus power and hope were strengthened more and more within me till there came upon my mind a sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined <\s>
<s> alas that love should be a blight and snare to those who seek all sympathies in one such once i sought in vain then black despair the shadow of a starless night was thrown over the world in which i moved alone 50 yet never found i one not false to me hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone which crushed and withered mine that could not be aught but a lifeless clod until revived by thee <\s>
<s> thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart 55 fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain how beautiful and calm and free thou wert in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain and walked as free as light the clouds among 60 which many an envious slave then breathed in vain from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long <\s>
<s> no more alone through the world's wilderness although i trod the paths of high intent 65 i journeyed now no more companionless where solitude is like despair i went there is the wisdom of a stern content when poverty can blight the just and good when infamy dares mock the innocent 70 and cherished friends turn with the multitude to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood <\s>
<s> now has descended a serener hour and with inconstant fortune friends return though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power 75 which says let scorn be not repaid with scorn <\s>
<s> and from thy side two gentle babes are born to fill our home with smiles and thus are we most fortunate beneath life's beaming morn and these delights and thou have been to me 80 the parents of the song i consecrate to thee <\s>
<s> is it that now my inexperienced fingers but strike the prelude of a loftier strain <\s>
<s> or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers soon pause in silence ne'er to sound again 85 though it might shake the anarch custom's reign and charm the minds of men to truth's own sway holier than was amphion's <\s>
<s> i would fain reply in hope but i am worn away and death and love are yet contending for their prey <\s>
<s> and what art thou <\s>

<s> when the last hope of trampled france had failed like a brief dream of unremaining glory from visions of despair i rose and scaled the peak of an aerial promontory 130 whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary and saw the golden dawn break forth and waken each cloud and every wave but transitory the calm for sudden the firm earth was shaken as if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken <\s>
<s> so as i stood one blast of muttering thunder burst in far peals along the waveless deep when gathering fast around above and under long trains of tremulous mist began to creep until their complicating lines did steep 140 the orient sun in shadow not a sound was heard one horrible repose did keep the forests and the floods and all around darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground <\s>
<s> tis the rushing of a wind that sweeps 145 earth and the ocean <\s>
<s> the lightnings yawn deluging heaven with fire and the lashed deeps glitter and boil beneath it rages on one mighty stream whirlwind and waves upthrown lightning and hail and darkness eddying by <\s>
<s> 150 there is a pause the sea birds that were gone into their caves to shriek come forth to spy what calm has fall'n on earth what light is in the sky <\s>
<s> for where the irresistible storm had cloven that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen 155 fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven most delicately and the ocean green beneath that opening spot of blue serene quivered like burning emerald calm was spread on all below but far on high between 160 earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled countless and swift as leaves on autumn's tempest shed <\s>
<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>
<s> even like a bark which from a chasm of mountains dark vast and overhanging on a river which there collects the strength of all its fountains comes forth whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver sails oars and stream tending to one endeavour 185 so from that chasm of light a winged form on all the winds of heaven approaching ever floated dilating as it came the storm pursued it with fierce blasts and lightnings swift and warm <\s>
<s> a course precipitous of dizzy speed 190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight <\s>
<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>
<s> it seemed that this fair shape had looked upon that unimaginable fight and now that her sweet eyes were weary of the sun as brightly it illustrated her woe for in the tears which silently to flow 275 paused not its lustre hung she watching aye the foam wreaths which the faint tide wove below upon the spangled sands groaned heavily and after every groan looked up over the sea <\s>
<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>

<s> no living thing was there beside one woman whom i found wandering in the streets and she was withered from a likeness of aught human 2760 into a fiend by some strange misery soon as she heard my steps she leaped on me and glued her burning lips to mine and laughed with a loud long and frantic laugh of glee and cried now mortal thou hast deeply quaffed 2765 the plague's blue kisses soon millions shall pledge the draught <\s>

<s> even when he saw her wondrous loveliness one moment to great nature's sacred power he bent and was no longer passionless but when he bade her to his secret bower be borne a loveless victim and she tore 2870 her locks in agony and her words of flame and mightier looks availed not then he bore again his load of slavery and became a king a heartless beast a pageant and a name <\s>

<s> her madness was a beam of light a power which dawned through the rent soul and words it gave 2885 gestures and looks such as in whirlwinds bore which might not be withstood whence none could save all who approached their sphere like some calm wave vexed into whirlpools by the chasms beneath and sympathy made each attendant slave 2890 fearless and free and they began to breathe deep curses like the voice of flames far underneath <\s>

<s> they bore her to a bark and the swift stroke of silent rowers clove the blue moonlight seas until upon their path the morning broke they anchored then where be there calm or breeze 2905 the gloomiest of the drear symplegades shakes with the sleepless surge the ethiop there wound his long arms around her and with knees like iron clasped her feet and plunged with her among the closing waves out of the boundless air <\s>
<s> swift as an eagle stooping from the plain of morning light into some shadowy wood he plunged through the green silence of the main through many a cavern which the eternal flood had scooped as dark lairs for its monster brood 2915 and among mighty shapes which fled in wonder and among mightier shadows which pursued his heels he wound until the dark rocks under he touched a golden chain a sound arose like thunder <\s>
<s> a stunning clang of massive bolts redoubling 2920 beneath the deep a burst of waters driven as from the roots of the sea raging and bubbling and in that roof of crags a space was riven through which there shone the emerald beams of heaven shot through the lines of many waves inwoven 2925 like sunlight through acacia woods at even through which his way the diver having cloven passed like a spark sent up out of a burning oven <\s>
<s> and then she said he laid me in a cave above the waters by that chasm of sea 2930 a fountain round and vast in which the wave imprisoned boiled and leaped perpetually down which one moment resting he did flee winning the adverse depth that spacious cell like an hupaithric temple wide and high 2935 whose aery dome is inaccessible was pierced with one round cleft through which the sunbeams fell <\s>
<s> below the fountain's brink was richly paven with the deep's wealth coral and pearl and sand like spangling gold and purple shells engraven 2940 with mystic legends by no mortal hand left there when thronging to the moon's command the gathering waves rent the hesperian gate of mountains and on such bright floor did stand columns and shapes like statues and the state 2945 of kingless thrones which earth did in her heart create <\s>
<s> the fiend of madness which had made its prey of my poor heart was lulled to sleep awhile there was an interval of many a day and a sea eagle brought me food the while 2950 whose nest was built in that untrodden isle and who to be the gaoler had been taught of that strange dungeon as a friend whose smile like light and rest at morn and even is sought that wild bird was to me till madness misery brought <\s>
<s> the misery of a madness slow and creeping which made the earth seem fire the sea seem air and the white clouds of noon which oft were sleeping in the blue heaven so beautiful and fair like hosts of ghastly shadows hovering there 2960 and the sea eagle looked a fiend who bore thy mangled limbs for food thus all things were transformed into the agony which i wore even as a poisoned robe around my bosom's core <\s>
<s> again i knew the day and night fast fleeing 2965 the eagle and the fountain and the air another frenzy came there seemed a being within me a strange load my heart did bear as if some living thing had made its lair even in the fountains of my life a long 2970 and wondrous vision wrought from my despair then grew like sweet reality among dim visionary woes an unreposing throng <\s>
<s> methought i was about to be a mother month after month went by and still i dreamed 2975 that we should soon be all to one another i and my child and still new pulses seemed to beat beside my heart and still i deemed there was a babe within and when the rain of winter through the rifted cavern streamed 2980 methought after a lapse of lingering pain i saw that lovely shape which near my heart had lain <\s>
<s> it was a babe beautiful from its birth it was like thee dear love its eyes were thine its brow its lips and so upon the earth 2985 it laid its fingers as now rest on mine thine own beloved twas a dream divine even to remember how it fled how swift how utterly might make the heart repine though twas a dream then cythna did uplift 2990 her looks on mine as if some doubt she sought to shift 19 <\s>
<s> a doubt which would not flee a tenderness of questioning grief a source of thronging tears which having passed as one whom sobs oppress she spoke yes in the wilderness of years 2995 her memory aye like a green home appears she sucked her fill even at this breast sweet love for many months <\s>
<s> i had no mortal fears methought i felt her lips and breath approve it was a human thing which to my bosom clove <\s>
<s> i watched the dawn of her first smiles and soon when zenith stars were trembling on the wave or when the beams of the invisible moon or sun from many a prism within the cave their gem born shadows to the water gave 3005 her looks would hunt them and with outspread hand from the swift lights which might that fountain pave she would mark one and laugh when that command slighting it lingered there and could not understand <\s>
<s> methought her looks began to talk with me 3010 and no articulate sounds but something sweet her lips would frame so sweet it could not be that it was meaningless her touch would meet mine and our pulses calmly flow and beat in response while we slept and on a day 3015 when i was happiest in that strange retreat with heaps of golden shells we two did play both infants weaving wings for time's perpetual way <\s>
<s> ere night methought her waning eyes were grown weary with joy and tired with our delight 3020 we on the earth like sister twins lay down on one fair mother's bosom from that night she fled like those illusions clear and bright which dwell in lakes when the red moon on high pause ere it wakens tempest and her flight 3025 though twas the death of brainless fantasy yet smote my lonesome heart more than all misery <\s>
<s> it seemed that in the dreary night the diver who brought me thither came again and bore my child away <\s>
<s> i saw the waters quiver 3030 when he so swiftly sunk as once before then morning came it shone even as of yore but i was changed the very life was gone out of my heart i wasted more and more day after day and sitting there alone 3035 vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan <\s>
<s> i was no longer mad and yet methought my breasts were swoln and changed in every vein the blood stood still one moment while that thought was passing with a gush of sickening pain 3040 it ebbed even to its withered springs again when my wan eyes in stern resolve i turned from that most strange delusion which would fain have waked the dream for which my spirit yearned with more than human love then left it unreturned <\s>
<s> so now my reason was restored to me i struggled with that dream which like a beast most fierce and beauteous in my memory had made its lair and on my heart did feast but all that cave and all its shapes possessed 3050 by thoughts which could not fade renewed each one some smile some look some gesture which had blessed me heretofore i sitting there alone vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan <\s>
<s> time passed i know not whether months or years 3055 for day nor night nor change of seasons made its note but thoughts and unavailing tears and i became at last even as a shade a smoke a cloud on which the winds have preyed till it be thin as air until one even 3060 a nautilus upon the fountain played spreading his azure sail where breath of heaven descended not among the waves and whirlpools driven <\s>
<s> and when the eagle came that lovely thing oaring with rosy feet its silver boat 3065 fled near me as for shelter on slow wing the eagle hovering o'er his prey did float but when he saw that i with fear did note his purpose proffering my own food to him the eager plumes subsided on his throat 3070 he came where that bright child of sea did swim and o'er it cast in peace his shadow broad and dim <\s>
<s> this wakened me it gave me human strength and hope i know not whence or wherefore rose but i resumed my ancient powers at length 3075 my spirit felt again like one of those like thine whose fate it is to make the woes of humankind their prey what was this cave <\s>
<s> its deep foundation no firm purpose knows immutable resistless strong to save 3080 like mind while yet it mocks the all devouring grave <\s>
<s> and where was laon <\s>
<s> might my heart be dead while that far dearer heart could move and be <\s>
<s> or whilst over the earth the pall was spread which i had sworn to rend <\s>
<s> i might be free 3085 could i but win that friendly bird to me to bring me ropes and long in vain i sought by intercourse of mutual imagery of objects if such aid he could be taught but fruit and flowers and boughs yet never ropes he brought <\s>
<s> we live in our own world and mine was made from glorious fantasies of hope departed aye we are darkened with their floating shade or cast a lustre on them time imparted such power to me i became fearless hearted 3095 my eye and voice grew firm calm was my mind and piercing like the morn now it has darted its lustre on all hidden things behind yon dim and fading clouds which load the weary wind <\s>
<s> my mind became the book through which i grew 3100 wise in all human wisdom and its cave which like a mine i rifled through and through to me the keeping of its secrets gave one mind the type of all the moveless wave whose calm reflects all moving things that are 3105 necessity and love and life the grave and sympathy fountains of hope and fear justice and truth and time and the world's natural sphere <\s>
<s> and on the sand would i make signs to range these woofs as they were woven of my thought 3110 clear elemental shapes whose smallest change a subtler language within language wrought the key of truths which once were dimly taught in old crotona and sweet melodies of love in that lorn solitude i caught 3115 from mine own voice in dream when thy dear eyes shone through my sleep and did that utterance harmonize <\s>
<s> thy songs were winds whereon i fled at will as in a winged chariot o'er the plain of crystal youth and thou wert there to fill 3120 my heart with joy and there we sate again on the gray margin of the glimmering main happy as then but wiser far for we smiled on the flowery grave in which were lain fear faith and slavery and mankind was free 3125 equal and pure and wise in wisdom's prophecy <\s>
<s> for to my will my fancies were as slaves to do their sweet and subtile ministries and oft from that bright fountain's shadowy waves they would make human throngs gather and rise 3130 to combat with my overflowing eyes and voice made deep with passion thus i grew familiar with the shock and the surprise and war of earthly minds from which i drew the power which has been mine to frame their thoughts anew <\s>
<s> and thus my prison was the populous earth where i saw even as misery dreams of morn before the east has given its glory birth religion's pomp made desolate by the scorn of wisdom's faintest smile and thrones uptorn 3140 and dwellings of mild people interspersed with undivided fields of ripening corn and love made free a hope which we have nursed even with our blood and tears until its glory burst <\s>
<s> all is not lost <\s>
<s> there is some recompense 3145 for hope whose fountain can be thus profound even throned evil's splendid impotence girt by its hell of power the secret sound of hymns to truth and freedom the dread bound of life and death passed fearlessly and well 3150 dungeons wherein the high resolve is found racks which degraded woman's greatness tell and what may else be good and irresistible <\s>
<s> such are the thoughts which like the fires that flare in storm encompassed isles we cherish yet 3155 in this dark ruin such were mine even there as in its sleep some odorous violet while yet its leaves with nightly dews are wet breathes in prophetic dreams of day's uprise or as ere scythian frost in fear has met 3160 spring's messengers descending from the skies the buds foreknow their life this hope must ever rise <\s>
<s> so years had passed when sudden earthquake rent the depth of ocean and the cavern cracked with sound as if the world's wide continent 3165 had fallen in universal ruin wracked and through the cleft streamed in one cataract the stifling waters when i woke the flood whose banded waves that crystal cave had sacked was ebbing round me and my bright abode 3170 before me yawned a chasm desert and bare and broad <\s>

<s> note on the revolt of islam by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley possessed two remarkable qualities of intellect a brilliant imagination and a logical exactness of reason <\s>
<s> his inclinations led him he fancied almost alike to poetry and metaphysical discussions <\s>
<s> i say he fancied because i believe the former to have been paramount and that it would have gained the mastery even had he struggled against it <\s>
<s> however he said that he deliberated at one time whether he should dedicate himself to poetry or metaphysics and resolving on the former he educated himself for it discarding in a great measure his philosophical pursuits and engaging himself in the study of the poets of greece italy and england <\s>
<s> to these may be added a constant perusal of portions of the old testament the psalms the book of job the prophet isaiah and others the sublime poetry of which filled him with delight <\s>
<s> as a poet his intellect and compositions were powerfully influenced by exterior circumstances and especially by his place of abode <\s>
<s> he was very fond of travelling and ill health increased this restlessness <\s>
<s> the sufferings occasioned by a cold english winter made him pine especially when our colder spring arrived for a more genial climate <\s>
<s> in 1816 he again visited switzerland and rented a house on the banks of the lake of geneva and many a day in cloud or sunshine was passed alone in his boat sailing as the wind listed or weltering on the calm waters <\s>
<s> the majestic aspect of nature ministered such thoughts as he afterwards enwove in verse <\s>
<s> his lines on the bridge of the arve and his hymn to intellectual beauty were written at this time <\s>
<s> perhaps during this summer his genius was checked by association with another poet whose nature was utterly dissimilar to his own yet who in the poem he wrote at that time gave tokens that he shared for a period the more abstract and etherealised inspiration of shelley <\s>
<s> the saddest events awaited his return to england but such was his fear to wound the feelings of others that he never expressed the anguish he felt and seldom gave vent to the indignation roused by the persecutions he underwent while the course of deep unexpressed passion and the sense of injury engendered the desire to embody themselves in forms defecated of all the weakness and evil which cling to real life <\s>
<s> he chose therefore for his hero a youth nourished in dreams of liberty some of whose actions are in direct opposition to the opinions of the world but who is animated throughout by an ardent love of virtue and a resolution to confer the boons of political and intellectual freedom on his fellow creatures <\s>
<s> he created for this youth a woman such as he delighted to imagine full of enthusiasm for the same objects and they both with will unvanquished and the deepest sense of the justice of their cause met adversity and death <\s>
<s> there exists in this poem a memorial of a friend of his youth <\s>
<s> the character of the old man who liberates laon from his tower prison and tends on him in sickness is founded on that of doctor lind who when shelley was at eton had often stood by to befriend and support him and whose name he never mentioned without love and veneration <\s>
<s> during the year 1817 we were established at marlow in buckinghamshire <\s>
<s> shelley's choice of abode was fixed chiefly by this town being at no great distance from london and its neighbourhood to the thames <\s>
<s> the poem was written in his boat as it floated under the beech groves of bisham or during wanderings in the neighbouring country which is distinguished for peculiar beauty <\s>
<s> the chalk hills break into cliffs that overhang the thames or form valleys clothed with beech the wilder portion of the country is rendered beautiful by exuberant vegetation and the cultivated part is peculiarly fertile <\s>
<s> with all this wealth of nature which either in the form of gentlemen's parks or soil dedicated to agriculture flourishes around marlow was inhabited i hope it is altered now by a very poor population <\s>
<s> the women are lacemakers and lose their health by sedentary labour for which they were very ill paid <\s>
<s> the poor laws ground to the dust not only the paupers but those who had risen just above that state and were obliged to pay poor rates <\s>
<s> the changes produced by peace following a long war and a bad harvest brought with them the most heart rending evils to the poor <\s>
<s> shelley afforded what alleviation he could <\s>
<s> in the winter while bringing out his poem he had a severe attack of ophthalmia caught while visiting the poor cottages <\s>
<s> i mention these things for this minute and active sympathy with his fellow creatures gives a thousandfold interest to his speculations and stamps with reality his pleadings for the human race <\s>
<s> the poem bold in its opinions and uncompromising in their expression met with many censurers not only among those who allow of no virtue but such as supports the cause they espouse but even among those whose opinions were similar to his own <\s>
<s> i extract a portion of a letter written in answer to one of these friends <\s>
<s> it best details the impulses of shelley's mind and his motives it was written with entire unreserve and is therefore a precious monument of his own opinion of his powers of the purity of his designs and the ardour with which he clung in adversity and through the valley of the shadow of death to views from which he believed the permanent happiness of mankind must eventually spring <\s>
<s> marlowe december 11 1817 <\s>
<s> i have read and considered all that you say about my general powers and the particular instance of the poem in which i have attempted to develop them <\s>
<s> nothing can be more satisfactory to me than the interest which your admonitions express <\s>
<s> but i think you are mistaken in some points with regard to the peculiar nature of my powers whatever be their amount <\s>
<s> i listened with deference and self suspicion to your censures of the revolt of islam but the productions of mine which you commend hold a very low place in my own esteem and this reassures me in some degree at least <\s>
<s> the poem was produced by a series of thoughts which filled my mind with unbounded and sustained enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i felt the precariousness of my life and i engaged in this task resolved to leave some record of myself <\s>
<s> much of what the volume contains was written with the same feeling as real though not so prophetic as the communications of a dying man <\s>
<s> i never presumed indeed to consider it anything approaching to faultless but when i consider contemporary productions of the same apparent pretensions i own i was filled with confidence <\s>
<s> i felt that it was in many respects a genuine picture of my own mind <\s>
<s> i felt that the sentiments were true not assumed <\s>
<s> and in this have i long believed that my power consists in sympathy and that part of the imagination which relates to sentiment and contemplation <\s>
<s> i am formed if for anything not in common with the herd of mankind to apprehend minute and remote distinctions of feeling whether relative to external nature or the living beings which surround us and to communicate the conceptions which result from considering either the moral or the material universe as a whole <\s>
<s> of course i believe these faculties which perhaps comprehend all that is sublime in man to exist very imperfectly in my own mind <\s>
<s> but when you advert to my chancery paper a cold forced unimpassioned insignificant piece of cramped and cautious argument and to the little scrap about mandeville which expressed my feelings indeed but cost scarcely two minutes thought to express as specimens of my powers more favourable than that which grew as it were from the agony and bloody sweat of intellectual travail surely i must feel that in some manner either i am mistaken in believing that i have any talent at all or you in the selection of the specimens of it <\s>
<s> yet after all i cannot but be conscious in much of what i write of an absence of that tranquillity which is the attribute and accompaniment of power <\s>
<s> this feeling alone would make your most kind and wise admonitions on the subject of the economy of intellectual force valuable to me <\s>
<s> and if i live or if i see any trust in coming years doubt not but that i shall do something whatever it may be which a serious and earnest estimate of my powers will suggest to me and which will be in every respect accommodated to their utmost limits <\s>
<s> shelley to godwin prince athanase <\s>
<s> the idea shelley had formed of prince athanase was a good deal modelled on alastor <\s>
<s> in the first sketch of the poem he named it pandemos and urania <\s>
<s> athanase seeks through the world the one whom he may love <\s>
<s> he meets in the ship in which he is embarked a lady who appears to him to embody his ideal of love and beauty <\s>
<s> but she proves to be pandemos or the earthly and unworthy venus who after disappointing his cherished dreams and hopes deserts him <\s>
<s> athanase crushed by sorrow pines and dies <\s>
<s> on his deathbed the lady who can really reply to his soul comes and kisses his lips the deathbed of athanase <\s>
<s> the poet describes her in the words of the final fragment page 164 <\s>
<s> this slender note is all we have to aid our imagination in shaping out the form of the poem such as its author imagined <\s>

<s> there was a youth who as with toil and travel had grown quite weak and gray before his time nor any could the restless griefs unravel which burned within him withering up his prime and goading him like fiends from land to land <\s>
<s> 5 not his the load of any secret crime for nought of ill his heart could understand but pity and wild sorrow for the same not his the thirst for glory or command baffled with blast of hope consuming shame 10 nor evil joys which fire the vulgar breast and quench in speedy smoke its feeble flame had left within his soul their dark unrest nor what religion fables of the grave feared he philosophy's accepted guest <\s>
<s> 15 for none than he a purer heart could have or that loved good more for itself alone of nought in heaven or earth was he the slave <\s>
<s> what sorrow strange and shadowy and unknown sent him a hopeless wanderer through mankind 20 if with a human sadness he did groan he had a gentle yet aspiring mind just innocent with varied learning fed and such a glorious consolation find in others joy when all their own is dead 25 he loved and laboured for his kind in grief and yet unlike all others it is said that from such toil he never found relief <\s>
<s> although a child of fortune and of power of an ancestral name the orphan chief 30 his soul had wedded wisdom and her dower is love and justice clothed in which he sate apart from men as in a lonely tower pitying the tumult of their dark estate yet even in youth did he not e'er abuse 35 the strength of wealth or thought to consecrate those false opinions which the harsh rich use to blind the world they famish for their pride nor did he hold from any man his dues but like a steward in honest dealings tried 40 with those who toiled and wept the poor and wise his riches and his cares he did divide <\s>
<s> fearless he was and scorning all disguise what he dared do or think though men might start he spoke with mild yet unaverted eyes 45 liberal he was of soul and frank of heart and to his many friends all loved him well whate'er he knew or felt he would impart if words he found those inmost thoughts to tell if not he smiled or wept and his weak foes 50 he neither spurned nor hated though with fell and mortal hate their thousand voices rose they passed like aimless arrows from his ear nor did his heart or mind its portal close to those or them or any whom life's sphere 55 may comprehend within its wide array <\s>
<s> what sadness made that vernal spirit sere he knew not <\s>
<s> though his life day after day was failing like an unreplenished stream though in his eyes a cloud and burthen lay 60 through which his soul like vesper's serene beam piercing the chasms of ever rising clouds shone softly burning though his lips did seem like reeds which quiver in impetuous floods and through his sleep and o'er each waking hour 65 thoughts after thoughts unresting multitudes were driven within him by some secret power which bade them blaze and live and roll afar like lights and sounds from haunted tower to tower o'er castled mountains borne when tempest's war 70 is levied by the night contending winds and the pale dalesmen watch with eager ear though such were in his spirit as the fiends which wake and feed an everliving woe what was this grief which ne'er in other minds 75 a mirror found he knew not none could know but on whoe'er might question him he turned the light of his frank eyes as if to show he knew not of the grief within that burned but asked forbearance with a mournful look 80 or spoke in words from which none ever learned the cause of his disquietude or shook with spasms of silent passion or turned pale so that his friends soon rarely undertook to stir his secret pain without avail 85 for all who knew and loved him then perceived that there was drawn an adamantine veil between his heart and mind both unrelieved wrought in his brain and bosom separate strife <\s>
<s> some said that he was mad others believed 90 that memories of an antenatal life made this where now he dwelt a penal hell and others said that such mysterious grief from god's displeasure like a darkness fell on souls like his which owned no higher law 95 than love love calm steadfast invincible by mortal fear or supernatural awe and others tis the shadow of a dream which the veiled eye of memory never saw but through the soul's abyss like some dark stream 100 through shattered mines and caverns underground rolls shaking its foundations and no beam of joy may rise but it is quenched and drowned in the dim whirlpools of this dream obscure soon its exhausted waters will have found 105 a lair of rest beneath thy spirit pure o athanase in one so good and great evil or tumult cannot long endure <\s>
<s> so spake they idly of another's state babbling vain words and fond philosophy 110 this was their consolation such debate men held with one another nor did he like one who labours with a human woe decline this talk as if its theme might be another not himself he to and fro 115 questioned and canvassed it with subtlest wit and none but those who loved him best could know that which he knew not how it galled and bit his weary mind this converse vain and cold for like an eyeless nightmare grief did sit 120 upon his being a snake which fold by fold pressed out the life of life a clinging fiend which clenched him if he stirred with deadlier hold and so his grief remained let it remain untold <\s>
<s> prince athanase had one beloved friend 125 an old old man with hair of silver white and lips where heavenly smiles would hang and blend with his wise words and eyes whose arrowy light shone like the reflex of a thousand minds <\s>
<s> he was the last whom superstition's blight 130 had spared in greece the blight that cramps and blinds and in his olive bower at oenoe had sate from earliest youth <\s>
<s> like one who finds a fertile island in the barren sea one mariner who has survived his mates 135 many a drear month in a great ship so he with soul sustaining songs and sweet debates of ancient lore there fed his lonely being the mind becomes that which it contemplates and thus zonoras by for ever seeing 140 their bright creations grew like wisest men and when he heard the crash of nations fleeing a bloodier power than ruled thy ruins then o sacred hellas <\s>
<s> many weary years he wandered till the path of laian's glen 145 was grass grown and the unremembered tears were dry in laian for their honoured chief who fell in byzant pierced by moslem spears and as the lady looked with faithful grief from her high lattice o'er the rugged path 150 where she once saw that horseman toil with brief and blighting hope who with the news of death struck body and soul as with a mortal blight she saw between the chestnuts far beneath an old man toiling up a weary wight 155 and soon within her hospitable hall she saw his white hairs glittering in the light of the wood fire and round his shoulders fall and his wan visage and his withered mien yet calm and gentle and majestical <\s>
<s> 160 and athanase her child who must have been then three years old sate opposite and gazed in patient silence <\s>
<s> such was zonoras and as daylight finds one amaranth glittering on the path of frost 165 when autumn nights have nipped all weaker kinds thus through his age dark cold and tempest tossed shone truth upon zonoras and he filled from fountains pure nigh overgrown and lost the spirit of prince athanase a child 170 with soul sustaining songs of ancient lore and philosophic wisdom clear and mild <\s>
<s> and sweet and subtle talk they evermore the pupil and the master shared until sharing that undiminishable store 175 the youth as shadows on a grassy hill outrun the winds that chase them soon outran his teacher and did teach with native skill strange truths and new to that experienced man still they were friends as few have ever been 180 who mark the extremes of life's discordant span <\s>
<s> so in the caverns of the forest green or on the rocks of echoing ocean hoar zonoras and prince athanase were seen by summer woodmen and when winter's roar 185 sounded o'er earth and sea its blast of war the balearic fisher driven from shore hanging upon the peaked wave afar then saw their lamp from laian's turret gleam piercing the stormy darkness like a star 190 which pours beyond the sea one steadfast beam whilst all the constellations of the sky seemed reeling through the storm ... they did but seem for lo <\s>

<s> pursuing still the path that wound the vast and knotted trees around through which slow shades were wandering to a deep lawny dell they came 105 to a stone seat beside a spring o'er which the columned wood did frame a roofless temple like the fane where ere new creeds could faith obtain man's early race once knelt beneath 110 the overhanging deity <\s>
<s> o'er this fair fountain hung the sky now spangled with rare stars <\s>
<s> the snake the pale snake that with eager breath creeps here his noontide thirst to slake 115 is beaming with many a mingled hue shed from yon dome's eternal blue when he floats on that dark and lucid flood in the light of his own loveliness and the birds that in the fountain dip 120 their plumes with fearless fellowship above and round him wheel and hover <\s>
<s> the fitful wind is heard to stir one solitary leaf on high the chirping of the grasshopper 125 fills every pause <\s>
<s> there is emotion in all that dwells at noontide here then through the intricate wild wood a maze of life and light and motion is woven <\s>
<s> but there is stillness now 130 gloom and the trance of nature now the snake is in his cave asleep the birds are on the branches dreaming only the shadows creep only the glow worm is gleaming 135 only the owls and the nightingales wake in this dell when daylight fails and gray shades gather in the woods and the owls have all fled far away in a merrier glen to hoot and play 140 for the moon is veiled and sleeping now <\s>
<s> the accustomed nightingale still broods on her accustomed bough but she is mute for her false mate has fled and left her desolate <\s>
<s> 145 this silent spot tradition old had peopled with the spectral dead <\s>
<s> for the roots of the speaker's hair felt cold and stiff as with tremulous lips he told that a hellish shape at midnight led 150 the ghost of a youth with hoary hair and sate on the seat beside him there till a naked child came wandering by when the fiend would change to a lady fair <\s>
<s> the truth was worse 155 for here a sister and a brother had solemnized a monstrous curse meeting in this fair solitude for beneath yon very sky had they resigned to one another 160 body and soul <\s>
<s> the multitude tracking them to the secret wood tore limb from limb their innocent child and stabbed and trampled on its mother but the youth for god's most holy grace 165 a priest saved to burn in the market place <\s>
<s> duly at evening helen came to this lone silent spot from the wrecks of a tale of wilder sorrow so much of sympathy to borrow 170 as soothed her own dark lot <\s>
<s> duly each evening from her home with her fair child would helen come to sit upon that antique seat while the hues of day were pale 175 and the bright boy beside her feet now lay lifting at intervals his broad blue eyes on her now where some sudden impulse calls following <\s>
<s> he was a gentle boy 180 and in all gentle sorts took joy oft in a dry leaf for a boat with a small feather for a sail his fancy on that spring would float if some invisible breeze might stir 185 its marble calm and helen smiled through tears of awe on the gay child to think that a boy as fair as he in years which never more may be by that same fount in that same wood 190 the like sweet fancies had pursued and that a mother lost like her had mournfully sate watching him <\s>
<s> then all the scene was wont to swim through the mist of a burning tear <\s>

<s> like the autumn wind when it unbinds the tangled locks of the nightshade's hair which is twined in the sultry summer air round the walls of an outworn sepulchre 210 did the voice of helen sad and sweet and the sound of her heart that ever beat as with sighs and words she breathed on her unbind the knots of her friend's despair till her thoughts were free to float and flow 215 and from her labouring bosom now like the bursting of a prisoned flame the voice of a long pent sorrow came <\s>
<s> rosalind i saw the dark earth fall upon the coffin and i saw the stone 220 laid over him whom this cold breast had pillowed to his nightly rest <\s>

<s> but i could smile and i could sleep though with a self accusing heart <\s>
<s> in morning's light in evening's gloom i watched and would not thence depart 230 my husband's unlamented tomb <\s>
<s> my children knew their sire was gone but when i told them he is dead they laughed aloud in frantic glee they clapped their hands and leaped about 235 answering each other's ecstasy with many a prank and merry shout <\s>
<s> but i sate silent and alone wrapped in the mock of mourning weed <\s>
<s> they laughed for he was dead but i 240 sate with a hard and tearless eye and with a heart which would deny the secret joy it could not quell low muttering o'er his loathed name till from that self contention came 245 remorse where sin was none a hell which in pure spirits should not dwell <\s>
<s> i'll tell thee truth <\s>
<s> he was a man hard selfish loving only gold yet full of guile his pale eyes ran 250 with tears which each some falsehood told and oft his smooth and bridled tongue would give the lie to his flushing cheek he was a coward to the strong he was a tyrant to the weak 255 on whom his vengeance he would wreak for scorn whose arrows search the heart from many a stranger's eye would dart and on his memory cling and follow his soul to its home so cold and hollow <\s>
<s> 260 he was a tyrant to the weak and we were such alas the day <\s>
<s> oft when my little ones at play were in youth's natural lightness gay or if they listened to some tale 265 of travellers or of fairy land when the light from the wood fire's dying brand flashed on their faces if they heard or thought they heard upon the stair his footstep the suspended word 270 died on my lips we all grew pale the babe at my bosom was hushed with fear if it thought it heard its father near and my two wild boys would near my knee cling cowed and cowering fearfully <\s>
<s> 275 i'll tell thee truth i loved another <\s>
<s> his name in my ear was ever ringing his form to my brain was ever clinging yet if some stranger breathed that name my lips turned white and my heart beat fast 280 my nights were once haunted by dreams of flame my days were dim in the shadow cast by the memory of the same <\s>

<s> on the fourth my gentle mother led me to the shrine to be his sworn bride eternally <\s>
<s> and now we stood on the altar stair 290 when my father came from a distant land and with a loud and fearful cry rushed between us suddenly <\s>
<s> i saw the stream of his thin gray hair i saw his lean and lifted hand 295 and heard his words and live <\s>
<s> wherefore do i live hold hold <\s>
<s> he cried i tell thee tis her brother <\s>
<s> thy mother boy beneath the sod of yon churchyard rests in her shroud so cold 300 i am now weak and pale and old we were once dear to one another i and that corpse <\s>
<s> thou art our child <\s>
<s> then with a laugh both long and wild the youth upon the pavement fell 305 they found him dead <\s>
<s> all looked on me the spasms of my despair to see but i was calm <\s>
<s> i went away i was clammy cold like clay <\s>
<s> i did not weep i did not speak 310 but day by day week after week i walked about like a corpse alive <\s>
<s> sweet friend you must believe this heart is stone it did not break <\s>
<s> my father lived a little while 315 but all might see that he was dying he smiled with such a woeful smile <\s>
<s> when he was in the churchyard lying among the worms we grew quite poor so that no one would give us bread 320 my mother looked at me and said faint words of cheer which only meant that she could die and be content so i went forth from the same church door to another husband's bed <\s>
<s> 325 and this was he who died at last when weeks and months and years had passed through which i firmly did fulfil my duties a devoted wife with the stern step of vanquished will 330 walking beneath the night of life whose hours extinguished like slow rain falling for ever pain by pain the very hope of death's dear rest which since the heart within my breast 335 of natural life was dispossessed its strange sustainer there had been <\s>
<s> when flowers were dead and grass was green upon my mother's grave that mother whom to outlive and cheer and make 340 my wan eyes glitter for her sake was my vowed task the single care which once gave life to my despair when she was a thing that did not stir and the crawling worms were cradling her 345 to a sleep more deep and so more sweet than a baby's rocked on its nurse's knee i lived a living pulse then beat beneath my heart that awakened me <\s>
<s> what was this pulse so warm and free <\s>
<s> i knew it could not be my own dull blood twas like a thought of liquid love that spread and wrought under my bosom and in my brain and crept with the blood through every vein 355 and hour by hour day after day the wonder could not charm away but laid in sleep my wakeful pain until i knew it was a child and then i wept <\s>
<s> for long long years 360 these frozen eyes had shed no tears but now 'twas the season fair and mild when april has wept itself to may i sate through the sweet sunny day by my window bowered round with leaves 365 and down my cheeks the quick tears fell like twinkling rain drops from the eaves when warm spring showers are passing o'er <\s>
<s> o helen none can ever tell the joy it was to weep once more <\s>
<s> 370 i wept to think how hard it were to kill my babe and take from it the sense of light and the warm air and my own fond and tender care and love and smiles ere i knew yet 375 that these for it might as for me be the masks of a grinning mockery <\s>
<s> and haply i would dream twere sweet to feed it from my faded breast or mark my own heart's restless beat 380 rock it to its untroubled rest and watch the growing soul beneath dawn in faint smiles and hear its breath half interrupted by calm sighs and search the depth of its fair eyes 385 for long departed memories <\s>
<s> and so i lived till that sweet load was lightened <\s>
<s> darkly forward flowed the stream of years and on it bore two shapes of gladness to my sight 390 two other babes delightful more in my lost soul's abandoned night than their own country ships may be sailing towards wrecked mariners who cling to the rock of a wintry sea <\s>
<s> 395 for each as it came brought soothing tears and a loosening warmth as each one lay sucking the sullen milk away about my frozen heart did play and weaned it oh how painfully 400 as they themselves were weaned each one from that sweet food even from the thirst of death and nothingness and rest strange inmate of a living breast <\s>
<s> which all that i had undergone 405 of grief and shame since she who first the gates of that dark refuge closed came to my sight and almost burst the seal of that lethean spring but these fair shadows interposed 410 for all delights are shadows now <\s>
<s> and from my brain to my dull brow the heavy tears gather and flow i cannot speak oh let me weep <\s>
<s> the tears which fell from her wan eyes 415 glimmered among the moonlight dew her deep hard sobs and heavy sighs their echoes in the darkness threw <\s>
<s> when she grew calm she thus did keep the tenor of her tale he died 420 i know not how he was not old if age be numbered by its years but he was bowed and bent with fears pale with the quenchless thirst of gold which like fierce fever left him weak 425 and his strait lip and bloated cheek were warped in spasms by hollow sneers and selfish cares with barren plough not age had lined his narrow brow and foul and cruel thoughts which feed 430 upon the withering life within like vipers on some poisonous weed <\s>
<s> whether his ill were death or sin none knew until he died indeed and then men owned they were the same <\s>
<s> 435 seven days within my chamber lay that corse and my babes made holiday at last i told them what is death the eldest with a kind of shame came to my knees with silent breath 440 and sate awe stricken at my feet and soon the others left their play and sate there too <\s>
<s> it is unmeet to shed on the brief flower of youth the withering knowledge of the grave 445 from me remorse then wrung that truth <\s>
<s> i could not bear the joy which gave too just a response to mine own <\s>
<s> i dared not feign a groan and in their artless looks i saw 450 between the mists of fear and awe that my own thought was theirs and they expressed it not in words but said each in its heart how every day will pass in happy work and play 455 now he is dead and gone away <\s>
<s> after the funeral all our kin assembled and the will was read <\s>
<s> my friend i tell thee even the dead have strength their putrid shrouds within 460 to blast and torture <\s>
<s> those who live still fear the living but a corse is merciless and power doth give to such pale tyrants half the spoil he rends from those who groan and toil 465 because they blush not with remorse among their crawling worms <\s>
<s> behold i have no child <\s>
<s> my tale grows old with grief and staggers let it reach the limits of my feeble speech 470 and languidly at length recline on the brink of its own grave and mine <\s>
<s> thou knowest what a thing is poverty among the fallen on evil days tis crime and fear and infamy 475 and houseless want in frozen ways wandering ungarmented and pain and worse than all that inward stain foul self contempt which drowns in sneers youth's starlight smile and makes its tears 480 first like hot gall then dry for ever <\s>
<s> and well thou knowest a mother never could doom her children to this ill and well he knew the same <\s>
<s> the will imported that if e'er again 485 i sought my children to behold or in my birthplace did remain beyond three days whose hours were told they should inherit nought and he to whom next came their patrimony 490 a sallow lawyer cruel and cold aye watched me as the will was read with eyes askance which sought to see the secrets of my agony and with close lips and anxious brow 495 stood canvassing still to and fro the chance of my resolve and all the dead man's caution just did call for in that killing lie twas said she is adulterous and doth hold 500 in secret that the christian creed is false and therefore is much need that i should have a care to save my children from eternal fire <\s>

<s> in truth the indian on the pyre of her dead husband half consumed as well might there be false as i to those abhorred embraces doomed 510 far worse than fire's brief agony as to the christian creed if true or false i never questioned it i took it as the vulgar do: nor my vexed soul had leisure yet 515 to doubt the things men say or deem that they are other than they seem <\s>

<s> i spoke to none nor did abide but silently i went my way nor noticed i where joyously 525 sate my two younger babes at play in the court yard through which i passed but went with footsteps firm and fast till i came to the brink of the ocean green and there a woman with gray hairs 530 who had my mother's servant been kneeling with many tears and prayers made me accept a purse of gold half of the earnings she had kept to refuge her when weak and old <\s>
<s> 535 with woe which never sleeps or slept i wander now <\s>
<s> tis a vain thought but on yon alp whose snowy head mid the azure air is islanded we see it o'er the flood of cloud 540 which sunrise from its eastern caves drives wrinkling into golden waves hung with its precipices proud from that gray stone where first we met there now who knows the dead feel nought 545 should be my grave for he who yet is my soul's soul once said twere sweet mid stars and lightnings to abide and winds and lulling snows that beat with their soft flakes the mountain wide 550 where weary meteor lamps repose and languid storms their pinions close and all things strong and bright and pure and ever during aye endure who knows if one were buried there 555 but these things might our spirits make amid the all surrounding air their own eternity partake <\s>
<s> then twas a wild and playful saying at which i laughed or seemed to laugh 560 they were his words now heed my praying and let them be my epitaph <\s>

<s> i know thou wilt and canst forgive 565 whilst in this erring world to live my soul disdained not that i thought its lying forms were worthy aught and much less thee <\s>
<s> helen o speak not so but come to me and pour thy woe 570 into this heart full though it be ay overflowing with its own i thought that grief had severed me from all beside who weep and groan its likeness upon earth to be 575 its express image but thou art more wretched <\s>
<s> we will not part henceforth if death be not division if so the dead feel no contrition <\s>
<s> but wilt thou hear since last we parted 580 all that has left me broken hearted <\s>
<s> the faintest stars are scarcely shorn of their thin beams by that delusive morn which sinks again in darkness like the light of early love soon lost in total night <\s>
<s> italian winds are mild but my bosom is cold wintry cold when the warm air weaves among the fresh leaves soft music my poor brain is wild and i am weak like a nursling child 590 though my soul with grief is gray and old <\s>
<s> rosalind weep not at thine own words though they must make me weep <\s>
<s> what is thy tale <\s>
<s> helen i fear twill shake thy gentle heart with tears <\s>
<s> thou well rememberest when we met no more 595 and though i dwelt with lionel that friendless caution pierced me sore with grief a wound my spirit bore indignantly but when he died with him lay dead both hope and pride <\s>
<s> all hope is buried now <\s>
<s> but then men dreamed the aged earth was labouring in that mighty birth which many a poet and a sage has aye foreseen the happy age 605 when truth and love shall dwell below among the works and ways of men which on this world not power but will even now is wanting to fulfil <\s>
<s> among mankind what thence befell 610 of strife how vain is known too well when liberty's dear paean fell mid murderous howls <\s>
<s> to lionel though of great wealth and lineage high yet through those dungeon walls there came 615 thy thrilling light o liberty <\s>
<s> and as the meteor's midnight flame startles the dreamer sun like truth flashed on his visionary youth and filled him not with love but faith 620 and hope and courage mute in death for love and life in him were twins born at one birth in every other first life then love its course begins though they be children of one mother 625 and so through this dark world they fleet divided till in death they meet but he loved all things ever <\s>
<s> then he passed amid the strife of men and stood at the throne of armed power 630 pleading for a world of woe secure as one on a rock built tower o'er the wrecks which the surge trails to and fro mid the passions wild of human kind he stood like a spirit calming them 635 for it was said his words could bind like music the lulled crowd and stem that torrent of unquiet dream which mortals truth and reason deem but is revenge and fear and pride <\s>
<s> 640 joyous he was and hope and peace on all who heard him did abide raining like dew from his sweet talk as where the evening star may walk along the brink of the gloomy seas 645 liquid mists of splendour quiver <\s>
<s> his very gestures touched to tears the unpersuaded tyrant never so moved before his presence stung the torturers with their victim's pain 650 and none knew how and through their ears the subtle witchcraft of his tongue unlocked the hearts of those who keep gold the world's bond of slavery <\s>
<s> men wondered and some sneered to see 655 one sow what he could never reap for he is rich they said and young and might drink from the depths of luxury <\s>
<s> if he seeks fame fame never crowned the champion of a trampled creed 660 if he seeks power power is enthroned mid ancient rights and wrongs to feed which hungry wolves with praise and spoil those who would sit near power must toil and such there sitting all may see <\s>
<s> 665 what seeks he <\s>
<s> all that others seek he casts away like a vile weed which the sea casts unreturningly <\s>
<s> that poor and hungry men should break the laws which wreak them toil and scorn 670 we understand but lionel we know is rich and nobly born <\s>
<s> so wondered they yet all men loved young lionel though few approved all but the priests whose hatred fell 675 like the unseen blight of a smiling day the withering honey dew which clings under the bright green buds of may whilst they unfold their emerald wings for he made verses wild and queer 680 on the strange creeds priests hold so dear because they bring them land and gold <\s>
<s> of devils and saints and all such gear he made tales which whoso heard or read would laugh till he were almost dead <\s>
<s> 685 so this grew a proverb don't get old till lionel's banquet in hell you hear and then you will laugh yourself young again <\s>
<s> so the priests hated him and he repaid their hate with cheerful glee <\s>
<s> 690 ah smiles and joyance quickly died for public hope grew pale and dim in an altered time and tide and in its wasting withered him as a summer flower that blows too soon 695 droops in the smile of the waning moon when it scatters through an april night the frozen dews of wrinkling blight <\s>
<s> none now hoped more <\s>
<s> gray power was seated safely on her ancestral throne 700 and faith the python undefeated even to its blood stained steps dragged on her foul and wounded train and men were trampled and deceived again and words and shows again could bind 705 the wailing tribes of human kind in scorn and famine <\s>
<s> fire and blood raged round the raging multitude to fields remote by tyrants sent to be the scorned instrument 710 with which they drag from mines of gore the chains their slaves yet ever wore and in the streets men met each other and by old altars and in halls and smiled again at festivals <\s>
<s> 715 but each man found in his heart's brother cold cheer for all though half deceived the outworn creeds again believed and the same round anew began which the weary world yet ever ran <\s>
<s> 720 many then wept not tears but gall within their hearts like drops which fall wasting the fountain stone away <\s>
<s> and in that dark and evil day did all desires and thoughts that claim 725 men's care ambition friendship fame love hope though hope was now despair indue the colours of this change as from the all surrounding air the earth takes hues obscure and strange 730 when storm and earthquake linger there <\s>
<s> and so my friend it then befell to many most to lionel whose hope was like the life of youth within him and when dead became 735 a spirit of unresting flame which goaded him in his distress over the world's vast wilderness <\s>
<s> three years he left his native land and on the fourth when he returned 740 none knew him he was stricken deep with some disease of mind and turned into aught unlike lionel <\s>
<s> on him on whom did he pause in sleep serenest smiles were wont to keep 745 and did he wake a winged band of bright persuasions which had fed on his sweet lips and liquid eyes kept their swift pinions half outspread to do on men his least command 750 on him whom once twas paradise even to behold now misery lay in his own heart twas merciless to all things else none may express its innocence and tenderness <\s>
<s> 755 twas said that he had refuge sought in love from his unquiet thought in distant lands and been deceived by some strange show for there were found blotted with tears as those relieved 760 by their own words are wont to do these mournful verses on the ground by all who read them blotted too <\s>
<s> how am i changed <\s>
<s> my hopes were once like fire i loved and i believed that life was love <\s>
<s> 765 how am i lost <\s>
<s> on wings of swift desire among heaven's winds my spirit once did move <\s>
<s> i slept and silver dreams did aye inspire my liquid sleep i woke and did approve all nature to my heart and thought to make 770 a paradise of earth for one sweet sake <\s>
<s> i love but i believe in love no more <\s>
<s> i feel desire but hope not <\s>
<s> o from sleep most vainly must my weary brain implore its long lost flattery now i wake to weep 775 and sit through the long day gnawing the core of my bitter heart and like a miser keep since none in what i feel take pain or pleasure to my own soul its self consuming treasure <\s>
<s> he dwelt beside me near the sea 780 and oft in evening did we meet when the waves beneath the starlight flee o'er the yellow sands with silver feet and talked our talk was sad and sweet till slowly from his mien there passed 785 the desolation which it spoke and smiles as when the lightning's blast has parched some heaven delighting oak the next spring shows leaves pale and rare but like flowers delicate and fair 790 on its rent boughs again arrayed his countenance in tender light his words grew subtile fire which made the air his hearers breathed delight his motions like the winds were free 795 which bend the bright grass gracefully then fade away in circlets faint and winged hope on which upborne his soul seemed hovering in his eyes like some bright spirit newly born 800 floating amid the sunny skies sprang forth from his rent heart anew <\s>
<s> yet o'er his talk and looks and mien tempering their loveliness too keen past woe its shadow backward threw 805 till like an exhalation spread from flowers half drunk with evening dew they did become infectious sweet and subtle mists of sense and thought which wrapped us soon when we might meet 810 almost from our own looks and aught the wild world holds <\s>
<s> and so his mind was healed while mine grew sick with fear for ever now his health declined like some frail bark which cannot bear 815 the impulse of an altered wind though prosperous and my heart grew full mid its new joy of a new care for his cheek became not pale but fair as rose o'ershadowed lilies are 820 and soon his deep and sunny hair in this alone less beautiful like grass in tombs grew wild and rare <\s>
<s> the blood in his translucent veins beat not like animal life but love 825 seemed now its sullen springs to move when life had failed and all its pains and sudden sleep would seize him oft like death so calm but that a tear his pointed eyelashes between 830 would gather in the light serene of smiles whose lustre bright and soft beneath lay undulating there <\s>
<s> his breath was like inconstant flame as eagerly it went and came 835 and i hung o'er him in his sleep till like an image in the lake which rains disturb my tears would break the shadow of that slumber deep then he would bid me not to weep 840 and say with flattery false yet sweet that death and he could never meet if i would never part with him <\s>
<s> and so we loved and did unite all that in us was yet divided 845 for when he said that many a rite by men to bind but once provided could not be shared by him and me or they would kill him in their glee i shuddered and then laughing said 850 we will have rites our faith to bind but our church shall be the starry night our altar the grassy earth outspread and our priest the muttering wind <\s>
<s> twas sunset as i spoke one star 855 had scarce burst forth when from afar the ministers of misrule sent seized upon lionel and bore his chained limbs to a dreary tower in the midst of a city vast and wide <\s>
<s> 860 for he they said from his mind had bent against their gods keen blasphemy for which though his soul must roasted be in hell's red lakes immortally yet even on earth must he abide 865 the vengeance of their slaves a trial i think men call it <\s>
<s> what avail are prayers and tears which chase denial from the fierce savage nursed in hate <\s>
<s> what the knit soul that pleading and pale 870 makes wan the quivering cheek which late it painted with its own delight <\s>
<s> as i could i stilled the tingling of my blood and followed him in their despite 875 as a widow follows pale and wild the murderers and corse of her only child and when we came to the prison door and i prayed to share his dungeon floor with prayers which rarely have been spurned 880 and when men drove me forth and i stared with blank frenzy on the sky a farewell look of love he turned half calming me then gazed awhile as if thro that black and massy pile 885 and thro the crowd around him there and thro the dense and murky air and the thronged streets he did espy what poets know and prophesy and said with voice that made them shiver 890 and clung like music in my brain and which the mute walls spoke again prolonging it with deepened strain fear not the tyrants shall rule for ever or the priests of the bloody faith 895 they stand on the brink of that mighty river whose waves they have tainted with death it is fed from the depths of a thousand dells around them it foams and rages and swells and their swords and their sceptres i floating see 900 like wrecks in the surge of eternity <\s>
<s> i dwelt beside the prison gate and the strange crowd that out and in passed some no doubt with mine own fate might have fretted me with its ceaseless din 905 but the fever of care was louder within <\s>
<s> soon but too late in penitence or fear his foes released him thence i saw his thin and languid form as leaning on the jailor's arm 910 whose hardened eyes grew moist the while to meet his mute and faded smile and hear his words of kind farewell he tottered forth from his damp cell <\s>
<s> many had never wept before 915 from whom fast tears then gushed and fell many will relent no more who sobbed like infants then aye all who thronged the prison's stony hall the rulers or the slaves of law 920 felt with a new surprise and awe that they were human till strong shame made them again become the same <\s>
<s> the prison blood hounds huge and grim from human looks the infection caught 925 and fondly crouched and fawned on him and men have heard the prisoners say who in their rotting dungeons lay that from that hour throughout one day the fierce despair and hate which kept 930 their trampled bosoms almost slept where like twin vultures they hung feeding on each heart's wound wide torn and bleeding because their jailors rule they thought grew merciful like a parent's sway <\s>
<s> 935 i know not how but we were free and lionel sate alone with me as the carriage drove thro the streets apace and we looked upon each other's face and the blood in our fingers intertwined 940 ran like the thoughts of a single mind as the swift emotions went and came thro the veins of each united frame <\s>
<s> so thro the long long streets we passed of the million peopled city vast 945 which is that desert where each one seeks his mate yet is alone beloved and sought and mourned of none until the clear blue sky was seen and the grassy meadows bright and green 950 and then i sunk in his embrace enclosing there a mighty space of love and so we travelled on by woods and fields of yellow flowers and towns and villages and towers 955 day after day of happy hours <\s>
<s> it was the azure time of june when the skies are deep in the stainless noon and the warm and fitful breezes shake the fresh green leaves of the hedgerow briar 960 and there were odours then to make the very breath we did respire a liquid element whereon our spirits like delighted things that walk the air on subtle wings 965 floated and mingled far away mid the warm winds of the sunny day <\s>
<s> and when the evening star came forth above the curve of the new bent moon and light and sound ebbed from the earth 970 like the tide of the full and the weary sea to the depths of its own tranquillity our natures to its own repose did the earth's breathless sleep attune like flowers which on each other close 975 their languid leaves when daylight's gone we lay till new emotions came which seemed to make each mortal frame one soul of interwoven flame a life in life a second birth 980 in worlds diviner far than earth which like two strains of harmony that mingle in the silent sky then slowly disunite passed by and left the tenderness of tears 985 a soft oblivion of all fears a sweet sleep so we travelled on till we came to the home of lionel among the mountains wild and lone beside the hoary western sea 990 which near the verge of the echoing shore the massy forest shadowed o'er <\s>
<s> the ancient steward with hair all hoar as we alighted wept to see his master changed so fearfully 995 and the old man's sobs did waken me from my dream of unremaining gladness the truth flashed o'er me like quick madness when i looked and saw that there was death on lionel yet day by day 1000 he lived till fear grew hope and faith and in my soul i dared to say nothing so bright can pass away death is dark and foul and dull but he is o how beautiful <\s>
<s> 1005 yet day by day he grew more weak and his sweet voice when he might speak which ne'er was loud became more low and the light which flashed through his waxen cheek grew faint as the rose like hues which flow 1010 from sunset o'er the alpine snow and death seemed not like death in him for the spirit of life o'er every limb lingered a mist of sense and thought <\s>
<s> when the summer wind faint odours brought 1015 from mountain flowers even as it passed his cheek would change as the noonday sea which the dying breeze sweeps fitfully <\s>
<s> if but a cloud the sky o'ercast you might see his colour come and go 1020 and the softest strain of music made sweet smiles yet sad arise and fade amid the dew of his tender eyes and the breath with intermitting flow made his pale lips quiver and part <\s>
<s> 1025 you might hear the beatings of his heart quick but not strong and with my tresses when oft he playfully would bind in the bowers of mossy lonelinesses his neck and win me so to mingle 1030 in the sweet depth of woven caresses and our faint limbs were intertwined alas <\s>
<s> the unquiet life did tingle from mine own heart through every vein like a captive in dreams of liberty 1035 who beats the walls of his stony cell <\s>
<s> but his it seemed already free like the shadow of fire surrounding me <\s>
<s> on my faint eyes and limbs did dwell that spirit as it passed till soon 1040 as a frail cloud wandering o'er the moon beneath its light invisible is seen when it folds its gray wings again to alight on midnight's dusky plain i lived and saw and the gathering soul 1045 passed from beneath that strong control and i fell on a life which was sick with fear of all the woe that now i bear <\s>
<s> amid a bloomless myrtle wood on a green and sea girt promontory 1050 not far from where we dwelt there stood in record of a sweet sad story an altar and a temple bright circled by steps and o'er the gate was sculptured to fidelity 1055 and in the shrine an image sate all veiled but there was seen the light of smiles which faintly could express a mingled pain and tenderness through that ethereal drapery <\s>
<s> 1060 the left hand held the head the right beyond the veil beneath the skin you might see the nerves quivering within was forcing the point of a barbed dart into its side convulsing heart <\s>
<s> 1065 an unskilled hand yet one informed with genius had the marble warmed with that pathetic life <\s>
<s> this tale it told a dog had from the sea when the tide was raging fearfully 1070 dragged lionel's mother weak and pale then died beside her on the sand and she that temple thence had planned but it was lionel's own hand had wrought the image <\s>
<s> each new moon 1075 that lady did in this lone fane the rites of a religion sweet whose god was in her heart and brain the seasons loveliest flowers were strewn on the marble floor beneath her feet 1080 and she brought crowns of sea buds white whose odour is so sweet and faint and weeds like branching chrysolite woven in devices fine and quaint <\s>
<s> and tears from her brown eyes did stain 1085 the altar need but look upon that dying statue fair and wan if tears should cease to weep again and rare arabian odours came through the myrtle copses steaming thence 1090 from the hissing frankincense whose smoke wool white as ocean foam hung in dense flocks beneath the dome that ivory dome whose azure night with golden stars like heaven was bright 1095 o'er the split cedar's pointed flame and the lady's harp would kindle there the melody of an old air softer than sleep the villagers mixed their religion up with hers 1100 and as they listened round shed tears <\s>
<s> one eve he led me to this fane daylight on its last purple cloud was lingering gray and soon her strain the nightingale began now loud 1105 climbing in circles the windless sky now dying music suddenly tis scattered in a thousand notes and now to the hushed ear it floats like field smells known in infancy 1110 then failing soothes the air again <\s>
<s> we sate within that temple lone pavilioned round with parian stone his mother's harp stood near and oft i had awakened music soft 1115 amid its wires the nightingale was pausing in her heaven taught tale now drain the cup said lionel which the poet bird has crowned so well with the wine of her bright and liquid song <\s>
<s> 1120 heardst thou not sweet words among that heaven resounding minstrelsy <\s>
<s> heard'st thou not that those who die awake in a world of ecstasy <\s>
<s> that love when limbs are interwoven 1125 and sleep when the night of life is cloven and thought to the world's dim boundaries clinging and music when one beloved is singing is death <\s>
<s> let us drain right joyously the cup which the sweet bird fills for me <\s>
<s> 1130 he paused and to my lips he bent his own like spirit his words went through all my limbs with the speed of fire and his keen eyes glittering through mine filled me with the flame divine 1135 which in their orbs was burning far like the light of an unmeasured star in the sky of midnight dark and deep yes twas his soul that did inspire sounds which my skill could ne'er awaken 1140 and first i felt my fingers sweep the harp and a long quivering cry burst from my lips in symphony the dusk and solid air was shaken as swift and swifter the notes came 1145 from my touch that wandered like quick flame and from my bosom labouring with some unutterable thing the awful sound of my own voice made my faint lips tremble in some mood 1150 of wordless thought lionel stood so pale that even beside his cheek the snowy column from its shade caught whiteness yet his countenance raised upward burned with radiance 1155 of spirit piercing joy whose light like the moon struggling through the night of whirlwind rifted clouds did break with beams that might not be confined <\s>
<s> i paused but soon his gestures kindled 1160 new power as by the moving wind the waves are lifted and my song to low soft notes now changed and dwindled and from the twinkling wires among my languid fingers drew and flung 1165 circles of life dissolving sound yet faint in aery rings they bound my lionel who as every strain grew fainter but more sweet his mien sunk with the sound relaxedly 1170 and slowly now he turned to me as slowly faded from his face that awful joy with looks serene he was soon drawn to my embrace and my wild song then died away 1175 in murmurs words i dare not say we mixed and on his lips mine fed till they methought felt still and cold what is it with thee love <\s>
<s> i said no word no look no motion <\s>
<s> yes 1180 there was a change but spare to guess nor let that moment's hope be told <\s>
<s> i looked and knew that he was dead and fell as the eagle on the plain falls when life deserts her brain 1185 and the mortal lightning is veiled again <\s>
<s> o that i were now dead <\s>
<s> but such did they not love demand too much those dying murmurs he forbade <\s>
<s> o that i once again were mad <\s>
<s> 1190 and yet dear rosalind not so for i would live to share thy woe <\s>
<s> did i forget thee too <\s>
<s> alas we know not what we do when we speak words <\s>
<s> no memory more 1195 is in my mind of that sea shore <\s>
<s> madness came on me and a troop of misty shapes did seem to sit beside me on a vessel's poop and the clear north wind was driving it <\s>
<s> 1200 then i heard strange tongues and saw strange flowers and the stars methought grew unlike ours and the azure sky and the stormless sea made me believe that i had died and waked in a world which was to me 1205 drear hell though heaven to all beside then a dead sleep fell on my mind whilst animal life many long years had rescued from a chasm of tears and when i woke i wept to find 1210 that the same lady bright and wise with silver locks and quick brown eyes the mother of my lionel had tended me in my distress and died some months before <\s>
<s> nor less 1215 wonder but far more peace and joy brought in that hour my lovely boy for through that trance my soul had well the impress of thy being kept and if i waked or if i slept 1220 no doubt though memory faithless be thy image ever dwelt on me and thus o lionel like thee is our sweet child <\s>
<s> tis sure most strange i knew not of so great a change 1225 as that which gave him birth who now is all the solace of my woe <\s>
<s> that lionel great wealth had left by will to me and that of all the ready lies of law bereft 1230 my child and me might well befall <\s>
<s> but let me think not of the scorn which from the meanest i have borne when for my child's beloved sake i mixed with slaves to vindicate 1235 the very laws themselves do make let me not say scorn is my fate lest i be proud suffering the same with those who live in deathless fame <\s>
<s> she ceased lo where red morning thro the woods 1240 is burning o'er the dew said rosalind <\s>
<s> and with these words they rose and towards the flood of the blue lake beneath the leaves now wind with equal steps and fingers intertwined thence to a lonely dwelling where the shore 1245 is shadowed with steep rocks and cypresses cleave with their dark green cones the silent skies and with their shadows the clear depths below and where a little terrace from its bowers of blooming myrtle and faint lemon flowers 1250 scatters its sense dissolving fragrance o'er the liquid marble of the windless lake and where the aged forest's limbs look hoar under the leaves which their green garments make they come tis helen's home and clean and white 1255 like one which tyrants spare on our own land in some such solitude its casements bright shone through their vine leaves in the morning sun and even within twas scarce like italy <\s>
<s> and when she saw how all things there were planned 1260 as in an english home dim memory disturbed poor rosalind she stood as one whose mind is where his body cannot be till helen led her where her child yet slept and said observe that brow was lionel's 1265 those lips were his and so he ever kept one arm in sleep pillowing his head with it <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>
<s> so rosalind and helen lived together 1275 thenceforth changed in all else yet friends again such as they were when o'er the mountain heather they wandered in their youth through sun and rain <\s>
<s> and after many years for human things change even like the ocean and the wind 1280 her daughter was restored to rosalind and in their circle thence some visitings of joy mid their new calm would intervene a lovely child she was of looks serene and motions which o'er things indifferent shed 1285 the grace and gentleness from whence they came <\s>
<s> and helen's boy grew with her and they fed from the same flowers of thought until each mind like springs which mingle in one flood became and in their union soon their parents saw 1290 the shadow of the peace denied to them <\s>
<s> and rosalind for when the living stem is cankered in its heart the tree must fall died ere her time and with deep grief and awe the pale survivors followed her remains 1295 beyond the region of dissolving rains up the cold mountain she was wont to call her tomb and on chiavenna's precipice they raised a pyramid of lasting ice whose polished sides ere day had yet begun 1300 caught the first glow of the unrisen sun the last when it had sunk and thro the night the charioteers of arctos wheeled round its glittering point as seen from helen's home whose sad inhabitants each year would come 1305 with willing steps climbing that rugged height and hang long locks of hair and garlands bound with amaranth flowers which in the clime's despite filled the frore air with unaccustomed light such flowers as in the wintry memory bloom 1310 of one friend left adorned that frozen tomb <\s>
<s> helen whose spirit was of softer mould whose sufferings too were less death slowlier led into the peace of his dominion cold she died among her kindred being old <\s>

<s> shelley had no care for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind and develop some high or abstruse truth <\s>
<s> when he does touch on human life and the human heart no pictures can be more faithful more delicate more subtle or more pathetic <\s>
<s> he never mentioned love but he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature that scarcely any other poet has bestowed on that passion <\s>
<s> when he spoke of it as the law of life which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves and others he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable truth <\s>
<s> in his eyes it was the essence of our being and all woe and pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness or insensibility or mistake <\s>
<s> by reverting in his mind to this first principle he discovered the source of many emotions and could disclose the secrets of all hearts and his delineations of passion and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature <\s>

<s> the meadows with fresh streams the bees with thyme the goats with the green leaves of budding spring are saturated not nor love with tears virgil's gallus <\s>
<s> count maddalo is a venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great fortune who without mixing much in the society of his countrymen resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city <\s>
<s> he is a person of the most consummate genius and capable if he would direct his energies to such an end of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country <\s>
<s> but it is his weakness to be proud he derives from a comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects that surround him an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life <\s>
<s> his passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of other men and instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former they have mutually lent each other strength <\s>
<s> his ambition preys upon itself for want of objects which it can consider worthy of exertion <\s>
<s> i say that maddalo is proud because i can find no other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample for in social life no human being can be more gentle patient and unassuming than maddalo <\s>
<s> he is cheerful frank and witty <\s>
<s> his more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication men are held by it as by a spell <\s>
<s> he has travelled much and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different countries <\s>
<s> julian is an englishman of good family passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind and the immense improvements of which by the extinction of certain moral superstitions human society may be yet susceptible <\s>
<s> without concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good may be made superior <\s>
<s> he is a complete infidel and a scoffer at all things reputed holy and maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing out his taunts against religion <\s>
<s> what maddalo thinks on these matters is not exactly known <\s>
<s> julian in spite of his heterodox opinions is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities <\s>
<s> how far this is possible the pious reader will determine <\s>
<s> julian is rather serious <\s>
<s> of the maniac i can give no information <\s>
<s> he seems by his own account to have been disappointed in love <\s>
<s> he was evidently a very cultivated and amiable person when in his right senses <\s>
<s> his story told at length might be like many other stories of the same kind the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart <\s>
<s> i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heaped from ever shifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds 5 such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited sea side which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes 10 broken and unrepaired and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down <\s>
<s> this ride was my delight <\s>
<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>
<s> meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains oh how beautiful is sunset when the glow 55 of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy <\s>
<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>
<s> ere it fade 85 said my companion i will show you soon a better station' so o'er the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leaned and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evening's gleam 90 its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment piled to heaven <\s>
<s> i was about to speak when 'we are even now at the point i meant said maddalo and bade the gondolieri cease to row <\s>
<s> 95 look julian on the west and listen well if you hear not a deep and heavy bell <\s>
<s> i looked and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile 100 a windowless deformed and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance swayed and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it tolled 105 in strong and black relief what we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower said maddalo and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell 110 to vespers as much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker i replied <\s>
<s> you talk as in years past said maddalo <\s>
<s> tis strange men change not <\s>
<s> you were ever still 115 among christ's flock a perilous infidel a wolf for the meek lambs if you can't swim beware of providence <\s>
<s> i looked on him but the gay smile had faded in his eye <\s>
<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>
<s> they know not till the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled <\s>
<s> i recall 130 the sense of what he said although i mar the force of his expressions <\s>
<s> the broad star of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill and the black bell became invisible and the red tower looked gray and all between 135 the churches ships and palaces were seen huddled in gloom into the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently <\s>
<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>
<s> salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spirit if man be 160 the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws tho i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faith thus much i spoke 165 and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night <\s>
<s> it is our will 170 that thus enchains us to permitted ill we might be otherwise we might be all we dream of happy high majestical <\s>
<s> where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind <\s>
<s> and if we were not weak 175 should we be less in deed than in desire <\s>
<s> ay if we were not weak and we aspire how vainly to be strong <\s>
<s> said maddalo you talk utopia <\s>
<s> it remains to know i then rejoined and those who try may find 180 how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as straw ... we are assured much may be conquered much may be endured of what degrades and crushes us <\s>
<s> we know that we have power over ourselves to do 185 and suffer what we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reigned before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind 190 yet feel their faith religion <\s>
<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>
<s> i knew one like you 195 who to this city came some months ago with whom i argued in this sort and he is now gone mad and so he answered me poor fellow <\s>
<s> but if you would like to go we'll visit him and his wild talk will show 200 how vain are such aspiring theories <\s>
<s> i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowed 205 his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be beloved with gentleness and being scorned what wonder if they die some living death <\s>
<s> this is not destiny 210 but man's own wilful ill <\s>
<s> as thus i spoke servants announced the gondola and we through the fast falling rain and high wrought sea sailed to the island where the madhouse stands <\s>
<s> the clap of tortured hands 215 fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen and laughter where complaint had merrier been moans shrieks and curses and blaspheming prayers accosted us <\s>
<s> we climbed the oozy stairs into an old courtyard <\s>
<s> i heard on high 220 then fragments of most touching melody but looking up saw not the singer there through the black bars in the tempestuous air i saw like weeds on a wrecked palace growing long tangled locks flung wildly forth and flowing 225 of those who on a sudden were beguiled into strange silence and looked forth and smiled hearing sweet sounds <\s>
<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>

<s> i cannot say 245 a lady came with him from france and when she left him and returned he wandered then about yon lonely isles of desert sand till he grew wild he had no cash or land remaining the police had brought him here 250 some fancy took him and he would not bear removal so i fitted up for him those rooms beside the sea to please his whim and sent him busts and books and urns for flowers which had adorned his life in happier hours 255 and instruments of music you may guess a stranger could do little more or less for one so gentle and unfortunate and those are his sweet strains which charm the weight from madmen's chains and make this hell appear 260 a heaven of sacred silence hushed to hear nay this was kind of you he had no claim as the world says' 'none but the very same which i on all mankind were i as he fallen to such deep reverse his melody 265 is interrupted now we hear the din of madmen shriek on shriek again begin let us now visit him after this strain he ever communes with himself again and sees nor hears not any <\s>
<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> from the baths of lucca in 1818 shelley visited venice and circumstances rendering it eligible that we should remain a few weeks in the neighbourhood of that city he accepted the offer of lord byron who lent him the use of a villa he rented near este and he sent for his family from lucca to join him <\s>
<s> i capuccini was a villa built on the site of a capuchin convent demolished when the french suppressed religious houses it was situated on the very overhanging brow of a low hill at the foot of a range of higher ones <\s>
<s> the house was cheerful and pleasant a vine trellised walk a pergola as it is called in italian led from the hall door to a summer house at the end of the garden which shelley made his study and in which he began the prometheus and here also as he mentions in a letter he wrote julian and maddalo <\s>
<s> a slight ravine with a road in its depth divided the garden from the hill on which stood the ruins of the ancient castle of este whose dark massive wall gave forth an echo and from whose ruined crevices owls and bats flitted forth at night as the crescent moon sunk behind the black and heavy battlements <\s>
<s> we looked from the garden over the wide plain of lombardy bounded to the west by the far apennines while to the east the horizon was lost in misty distance <\s>
<s> after the picturesque but limited view of mountain ravine and chestnut wood at the baths of lucca there was something infinitely gratifying to the eye in the wide range of prospect commanded by our new abode <\s>

<s> when we arrived at fusina we found that we had forgotten our passport and the soldiers on duty attempted to prevent our crossing the laguna but they could not resist shelley's impetuosity at such a moment <\s>

<s> the reader should consult the notes on the play at the end of the volume preface <\s>
<s> the greek tragic writers in selecting as their subject any portion of their national history or mythology employed in their treatment of it a certain arbitrary discretion <\s>
<s> they by no means conceived themselves bound to adhere to the common interpretation or to imitate in story as in title their rivals and predecessors <\s>
<s> such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition <\s>
<s> the agamemnonian story was exhibited on the athenian theatre with as many variations as dramas <\s>
<s> i have presumed to employ a similar license <\s>
<s> the prometheus unbound of aeschylus supposed the reconciliation of jupiter with his victim as the price of the disclosure of the danger threatened to his empire by the consummation of his marriage with thetis <\s>
<s> thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules <\s>
<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>
<s> but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind <\s>
<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>
<s> we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion <\s>
<s> the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it <\s>
<s> the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored <\s>
<s> as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art <\s>
<s> it creates but it creates by combination and representation <\s>
<s> poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study <\s>
<s> he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary <\s>
<s> the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual <\s>
<s> a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both <\s>
<s> every man's mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form <\s>
<s> poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age <\s>
<s> from this subjection the loftiest do not escape <\s>
<s> there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged <\s>
<s> if this similarity be the result of imitation i am willing to confess that i have imitated <\s>
<s> let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that i have what a scotch philosopher characteristically terms a passion for reforming the world what passion incited him to write and publish his book he omits to explain <\s>
<s> for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus <\s>
<s> but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life <\s>
<s> didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse <\s>
<s> my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness <\s>
<s> should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model <\s>
<s> the having spoken of myself with unaffected freedom will need little apology with the candid and let the uncandid consider that they injure me less than their own hearts and minds by misrepresentation <\s>
<s> whatever talents a person may possess to amuse and instruct others be they ever so inconsiderable he is yet bound to exert them if his attempt be ineffectual let the punishment of an unaccomplished purpose have been sufficient let none trouble themselves to heap the dust of oblivion upon his efforts the pile they raise will betray his grave which might otherwise have been unknown <\s>

<s> on the 12th of march 1818 shelley quitted england never to return <\s>
<s> his principal motive was the hope that his health would be improved by a milder climate he suffered very much during the winter previous to his emigration and this decided his vacillating purpose <\s>
<s> in december 1817 he had written from marlow to a friend saying my health has been materially worse <\s>
<s> my feelings at intervals are of a deadly and torpid kind or awakened to such a state of unnatural and keen excitement that only to instance the organ of sight i find the very blades of grass and the boughs of distant trees present themselves to me with microscopic distinctness <\s>
<s> towards evening i sink into a state of lethargy and inanimation and often remain for hours on the sofa between sleep and waking a prey to the most painful irritability of thought <\s>
<s> such with little intermission is my condition <\s>
<s> the hours devoted to study are selected with vigilant caution from among these periods of endurance <\s>
<s> it is not for this that i think of travelling to italy even if i knew that italy would relieve me <\s>
<s> but i have experienced a decisive pulmonary attack and although at present it has passed away without any considerable vestige of its existence yet this symptom sufficiently shows the true nature of my disease to be consumptive <\s>
<s> it is to my advantage that this malady is in its nature slow and if one is sufficiently alive to its advances is susceptible of cure from a warm climate <\s>
<s> in the event of its assuming any decided shape it would be my duty to go to italy without delay <\s>
<s> it is not mere health but life that i should seek and that not for my own sake i feel i am capable of trampling on all such weakness but for the sake of those to whom my life may be a source of happiness utility security and honour and to some of whom my death might be all that is the reverse <\s>
<s> in almost every respect his journey to italy was advantageous <\s>
<s> he left behind friends to whom he was attached but cares of a thousand kinds many springing from his lavish generosity crowded round him in his native country and except the society of one or two friends he had no compensation <\s>
<s> the climate caused him to consume half his existence in helpless suffering <\s>
<s> his dearest pleasure the free enjoyment of the scenes of nature was marred by the same circumstance <\s>
<s> he went direct to italy avoiding even paris and did not make any pause till he arrived at milan <\s>
<s> the first aspect of italy enchanted shelley it seemed a garden of delight placed beneath a clearer and brighter heaven than any he had lived under before <\s>
<s> he wrote long descriptive letters during the first year of his residence in italy which as compositions are the most beautiful in the world and show how truly he appreciated and studied the wonders of nature and art in that divine land <\s>
<s> the poetical spirit within him speedily revived with all the power and with more than all the beauty of his first attempts <\s>
<s> he meditated three subjects as the groundwork for lyrical dramas <\s>
<s> one was the story of tasso of this a slight fragment of a song of tasso remains <\s>
<s> the other was one founded on the book of job which he never abandoned in idea but of which no trace remains among his papers <\s>
<s> the third was the prometheus unbound <\s>
<s> the greek tragedians were now his most familiar companions in his wanderings and the sublime majesty of aeschylus filled him with wonder and delight <\s>
<s> the father of greek tragedy does not possess the pathos of sophocles nor the variety and tenderness of euripides the interest on which he founds his dramas is often elevated above human vicissitudes into the mighty passions and throes of gods and demi gods such fascinated the abstract imagination of shelley <\s>
<s> we spent a month at milan visiting the lake of como during that interval <\s>
<s> thence we passed in succession to pisa leghorn the baths of lucca venice este rome naples and back again to rome whither we returned early in march 1819 <\s>
<s> during all this time shelley meditated the subject of his drama and wrote portions of it <\s>
<s> other poems were composed during this interval and while at the bagni di lucca he translated plato's symposium <\s>
<s> but though he diversified his studies his thoughts centred in the prometheus <\s>
<s> at last when at rome during a bright and beautiful spring he gave up his whole time to the composition <\s>
<s> the spot selected for his study was as he mentions in his preface the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla <\s>
<s> these are little known to the ordinary visitor at rome <\s>
<s> he describes them in a letter with that poetry and delicacy and truth of description which render his narrated impressions of scenery of unequalled beauty and interest <\s>
<s> at first he completed the drama in three acts <\s>
<s> it was not till several months after when at florence that he conceived that a fourth act a sort of hymn of rejoicing in the fulfilment of the prophecies with regard to prometheus ought to be added to complete the composition <\s>
<s> the prominent feature of shelley's theory of the destiny of the human species was that evil is not inherent in the system of the creation but an accident that might be expelled <\s>
<s> this also forms a portion of christianity god made earth and man perfect till he by his fall brought death into the world and all our woe <\s>
<s> shelley believed that mankind had only to will that there should be no evil and there would be none <\s>
<s> it is not my part in these notes to notice the arguments that have been urged against this opinion but to mention the fact that he entertained it and was indeed attached to it with fervent enthusiasm <\s>
<s> that man could be so perfectionized as to be able to expel evil from his own nature and from the greater part of the creation was the cardinal point of his system <\s>
<s> and the subject he loved best to dwell on was the image of one warring with the evil principle oppressed not only by it but by all even the good who were deluded into considering evil a necessary portion of humanity a victim full of fortitude and hope and the spirit of triumph emanating from a reliance in the ultimate omnipotence of good <\s>
<s> such he had depicted in his last poem when he made laon the enemy and the victim of tyrants <\s>
<s> he now took a more idealized image of the same subject <\s>
<s> he followed certain classical authorities in figuring saturn as the good principle jupiter the usurping evil one and prometheus as the regenerator who unable to bring mankind back to primitive innocence used knowledge as a weapon to defeat evil by leading mankind beyond the state wherein they are sinless through ignorance to that in which they are virtuous through wisdom <\s>
<s> jupiter punished the temerity of the titan by chaining him to a rock of caucasus and causing a vulture to devour his still renewed heart <\s>
<s> there was a prophecy afloat in heaven portending the fall of jove the secret of averting which was known only to prometheus and the god offered freedom from torture on condition of its being communicated to him <\s>
<s> according to the mythological story this referred to the offspring of thetis who was destined to be greater than his father <\s>
<s> prometheus at last bought pardon for his crime of enriching mankind with his gifts by revealing the prophecy <\s>
<s> hercules killed the vulture and set him free and thetis was married to peleus the father of achilles <\s>
<s> shelley adapted the catastrophe of this story to his peculiar views <\s>
<s> the son greater than his father born of the nuptials of jupiter and thetis was to dethrone evil and bring back a happier reign than that of saturn <\s>
<s> prometheus defies the power of his enemy and endures centuries of torture till the hour arrives when jove blind to the real event but darkly guessing that some great good to himself will flow espouses thetis <\s>
<s> at the moment the primal power of the world drives him from his usurped throne and strength in the person of hercules liberates humanity typified in prometheus from the tortures generated by evil done or suffered <\s>
<s> asia one of the oceanides is the wife of prometheus she was according to other mythological interpretations the same as venus and nature <\s>
<s> when the benefactor of mankind is liberated nature resumes the beauty of her prime and is united to her husband the emblem of the human race in perfect and happy union <\s>
<s> in the fourth act the poet gives further scope to his imagination and idealizes the forms of creation such as we know them instead of such as they appeared to the greeks <\s>
<s> maternal earth the mighty parent is superseded by the spirit of the earth the guide of our planet through the realms of sky while his fair and weaker companion and attendant the spirit of the moon receives bliss from the annihilation of evil in the superior sphere <\s>
<s> shelley develops more particularly in the lyrics of this drama his abstruse and imaginative theories with regard to the creation <\s>
<s> it requires a mind as subtle and penetrating as his own to understand the mystic meanings scattered throughout the poem <\s>
<s> they elude the ordinary reader by their abstraction and delicacy of distinction but they are far from vague <\s>
<s> it was his design to write prose metaphysical essays on the nature of man which would have served to explain much of what is obscure in his poetry a few scattered fragments of observations and remarks alone remain <\s>
<s> he considered these philosophical views of mind and nature to be instinct with the intensest spirit of poetry <\s>
<s> more popular poets clothe the ideal with familiar and sensible imagery <\s>
<s> shelley loved to idealize the real to gift the mechanism of the material universe with a soul and a voice and to bestow such also on the most delicate and abstract emotions and thoughts of the mind <\s>
<s> sophocles was his great master in this species of imagery <\s>
<s> i find in one of his manuscript books some remarks on a line in the oedipus tyrannus which show at once the critical subtlety of shelley's mind and explain his apprehension of those minute and remote distinctions of feeling whether relative to external nature or the living beings which surround us which he pronounces in the letter quoted in the note to the revolt of islam to comprehend all that is sublime in man <\s>
<s> in the greek shakespeare sophocles we find the image pollas d odous elthonta phrontidos planois a line of almost unfathomable depth of poetry yet how simple are the images in which it is arrayed <\s>
<s> coming to many ways in the wanderings of careful thought <\s>
<s> if the words odous and planois had not been used the line might have been explained in a metaphorical instead of an absolute sense as we say ways and means and wanderings for error and confusion <\s>
<s> but they meant literally paths or roads such as we tread with our feet and wanderings such as a man makes when he loses himself in a desert or roams from city to city as oedipus the speaker of this verse was destined to wander blind and asking charity <\s>
<s> what a picture does this line suggest of the mind as a wilderness of intricate paths wide as the universe which is here made its symbol a world within a world which he who seeks some knowledge with respect to what he ought to do searches throughout as he would search the external universe for some valued thing which was hidden from him upon its surface <\s>
<s> in reading shelley's poetry we often find similar verses resembling but not imitating the greek in this species of imagery for though he adopted the style he gifted it with that originality of form and colouring which sprung from his own genius <\s>
<s> in the prometheus unbound shelley fulfils the promise quoted from a letter in the note on the revolt of islam <\s>
<s> while correcting the proof sheets of that poem it struck me that the poet had indulged in an exaggerated view of the evils of restored despotism which however injurious and degrading were less openly sanguinary than the triumph of anarchy such as it appeared in france at the close of the last century <\s>
<s> but at this time a book scenes of spanish life translated by lieutenant crawford from the german of dr <\s>
<s> huber of rostock fell into my hands <\s>
<s> the account of the triumph of the priests and the serviles after the french invasion of spain in 1823 bears a strong and frightful resemblance to some of the descriptions of the massacre of the patriots in the revolt of islam the tone of the composition is calmer and more majestic the poetry more perfect as a whole and the imagination displayed at once more pleasingly beautiful and more varied and daring <\s>
<s> the description of the hours as they are seen in the cave of demogorgon is an instance of this it fills the mind as the most charming picture we long to see an artist at work to bring to our view the cars drawn by rainbow winged steeds which trample the dim winds in each there stands a wild eyed charioteer urging their flight <\s>
<s> some look behind as fiends pursued them there and yet i see no shapes but the keen stars others with burning eyes lean forth and drink with eager lips the wind of their own speed as if the thing they loved fled on before and now even now they clasped it <\s>
<s> their bright locks stream like a comet's flashing hair they all sweep onward <\s>
<s> through the whole poem there reigns a sort of calm and holy spirit of love it soothes the tortured and is hope to the expectant till the prophecy is fulfilled and love untainted by any evil becomes the law of the world <\s>
<s> england had been rendered a painful residence to shelley as much by the sort of persecution with which in those days all men of liberal opinions were visited and by the injustice he had lately endured in the court of chancery as by the symptoms of disease which made him regard a visit to italy as necessary to prolong his life <\s>
<s> an exile and strongly impressed with the feeling that the majority of his countrymen regarded him with sentiments of aversion such as his own heart could experience towards none he sheltered himself from such disgusting and painful thoughts in the calm retreats of poetry and built up a world of his own with the more pleasure since he hoped to induce some one or two to believe that the earth might become such did mankind themselves consent <\s>
<s> the charm of the roman climate helped to clothe his thoughts in greater beauty than they had ever worn before <\s>
<s> and as he wandered among the ruins made one with nature in their decay or gazed on the praxitelean shapes that throng the vatican the capitol and the palaces of rome his soul imbibed forms of loveliness which became a portion of itself <\s>

<s> a manuscript was communicated to me during my travels in italy which was copied from the archives of the cenci palace at rome and contains a detailed account of the horrors which ended in the extinction of one of the noblest and richest families of that city during the pontificate of clement viii in the year 1599 <\s>
<s> the story is that an old man having spent his life in debauchery and wickedness conceived at length an implacable hatred towards his children which showed itself towards one daughter under the form of an incestuous passion aggravated by every circumstance of cruelty and violence <\s>
<s> this daughter after long and vain attempts to escape from what she considered a perpetual contamination both of body and mind at length plotted with her mother in law and brother to murder their common tyrant <\s>
<s> the young maiden who was urged to this tremendous deed by an impulse which overpowered its horror was evidently a most gentle and amiable being a creature formed to adorn and be admired and thus violently thwarted from her nature by the necessity of circumstance and opinion <\s>
<s> the deed was quickly discovered and in spite of the most earnest prayers made to the pope by the highest persons in rome the criminals were put to death <\s>
<s> the old man had during his life repeatedly bought his pardon from the pope for capital crimes of the most enormous and unspeakable kind at the price of a hundred thousand crowns the death therefore of his victims can scarcely be accounted for by the love of justice <\s>
<s> the pope among other motives for severity probably felt that whoever killed the count cenci deprived his treasury of a certain and copious source of revenue <\s>
<s> the papal government formerly took the most extraordinary precautions against the publicity of facts which offer so tragical a demonstration of its own wickedness and weakness so that the communication of the manuscript had become until very lately a matter of some difficulty such a story if told so as to present to the reader all the feelings of those who once acted it their hopes and fears their confidences and misgivings their various interests passions and opinions acting upon and with each other yet all conspiring to one tremendous end would be as a light to make apparent some of the most dark and secret caverns of the human heart <\s>
<s> on my arrival at rome i found that the story of the cenci was a subject not to be mentioned in italian society without awakening a deep and breathless interest and that the feelings of the company never failed to incline to a romantic pity for the wrongs and a passionate exculpation of the horrible deed to which they urged her who has been mingled two centuries with the common dust <\s>
<s> all ranks of people knew the outlines of this history and participated in the overwhelming interest which it seems to have the magic of exciting in the human heart <\s>
<s> i had a copy of guido's picture of beatrice which is preserved in the colonna palace and my servant instantly recognized it as the portrait of la cenci <\s>
<s> this national and universal interest which the story produces and has produced for two centuries and among all ranks of people in a great city where the imagination is kept for ever active and awake first suggested to me the conception of its fitness for a dramatic purpose <\s>
<s> in fact it is a tragedy which has already received from its capacity of awakening and sustaining the sympathy of men approbation and success <\s>
<s> nothing remained as i imagined but to clothe it to the apprehensions of my countrymen in such language and action as would bring it home to their hearts <\s>
<s> the deepest and the sublimest tragic compositions king lear and the two plays in which the tale of oedipus is told were stories which already existed in tradition as matters of popular belief and interest before shakspeare and sophocles made them familiar to the sympathy of all succeeding generations of mankind <\s>
<s> this story of the cenci is indeed eminently fearful and monstrous anything like a dry exhibition of it on the stage would be insupportable <\s>
<s> the person who would treat such a subject must increase the ideal and diminish the actual horror of the events so that the pleasure which arises from the poetry which exists in these tempestuous sufferings and crimes may mitigate the pain of the contemplation of the moral deformity from which they spring <\s>
<s> there must also be nothing attempted to make the exhibition subservient to what is vulgarly termed a moral purpose <\s>
<s> the highest moral purpose aimed at in the highest species of the drama is the teaching the human heart through its sympathies and antipathies the knowledge of itself in proportion to the possession of which knowledge every human being is wise just sincere tolerant and kind <\s>
<s> if dogmas can do more it is well but a drama is no fit place for the enforcement of them <\s>
<s> undoubtedly no person can be truly dishonoured by the act of another and the fit return to make to the most enormous injuries is kindness and forbearance and a resolution to convert the injurer from his dark passions by peace and love <\s>
<s> revenge retaliation atonement are pernicious mistakes <\s>
<s> if beatrice had thought in this manner she would have been wiser and better but she would never have been a tragic character the few whom such an exhibition would have interested could never have been sufficiently interested for a dramatic purpose from the want of finding sympathy in their interest among the mass who surround them <\s>
<s> it is in the restless and anatomizing casuistry with which men seek the justification of beatrice yet feel that she has done what needs justification it is in the superstitious horror with which they contemplate alike her wrongs and their revenge that the dramatic character of what she did and suffered consists <\s>
<s> i have endeavoured as nearly as possible to represent the characters as they probably were and have sought to avoid the error of making them actuated by my own conceptions of right or wrong false or true thus under a thin veil converting names and actions of the sixteenth century into cold impersonations of my own mind <\s>
<s> they are represented as catholics and as catholics deeply tinged with religion <\s>
<s> to a protestant apprehension there will appear something unnatural in the earnest and perpetual sentiment of the relations between god and men which pervade the tragedy of the cenci <\s>
<s> it will especially be startled at the combination of an undoubting persuasion of the truth of the popular religion with a cool and determined perseverance in enormous guilt <\s>
<s> but religion in italy is not as in protestant countries a cloak to be worn on particular days or a passport which those who do not wish to be railed at carry with them to exhibit or a gloomy passion for penetrating the impenetrable mysteries of our being which terrifies its possessor at the darkness of the abyss to the brink of which it has conducted him <\s>
<s> religion coexists as it were in the mind of an italian catholic with a faith in that of which all men have the most certain knowledge <\s>
<s> it is interwoven with the whole fabric of life <\s>
<s> it is adoration faith submission penitence blind admiration not a rule for moral conduct <\s>
<s> it has no necessary connection with any one virtue <\s>
<s> the most atrocious villain may be rigidly devout and without any shock to established faith confess himself to be so <\s>
<s> religion pervades intensely the whole frame of society and is according to the temper of the mind which it inhabits a passion a persuasion an excuse a refuge never a check <\s>
<s> cenci himself built a chapel in the court of his palace and dedicated it to st <\s>
<s> thomas the apostle and established masses for the peace of his soul <\s>
<s> thus in the first scene of the fourth act lucretia's design in exposing herself to the consequences of an expostulation with cenci after having administered the opiate was to induce him by a feigned tale to confess himself before death this being esteemed by catholics as essential to salvation and she only relinquishes her purpose when she perceives that her perseverance would expose beatrice to new outrages <\s>
<s> i have avoided with great care in writing this play the introduction of what is commonly called mere poetry and i imagine there will scarcely be found a detached simile or a single isolated description unless beatrice's description of the chasm appointed for her father's murder should be judged to be of that nature <\s>
<s> an idea in this speech was suggested by a most sublime passage in el purgaterio de san patricio of calderon the only plagiarism which i have intentionally committed in the whole piece in a dramatic composition the imagery and the passion should interpenetrate one another the former being reserved simply for the full development and illustration of the latter <\s>
<s> imagination is as the immortal god which should assume flesh for the redemption of mortal passion <\s>
<s> it is thus that the most remote and the most familiar imagery may alike be fit for dramatic purposes when employed in the illustration of strong feeling which raises what is low and levels to the apprehension that which is lofty casting over all the shadow of its own greatness <\s>
<s> in other respects i have written more carelessly that is without an over fastidious and learned choice of words <\s>
<s> in this respect i entirely agree with those modern critics who assert that in order to move men to true sympathy we must use the familiar language of men and that our great ancestors the ancient english poets are the writers a study of whom might incite us to do that for our own age which they have done for theirs <\s>
<s> but it must be the real language of men in general and not that of any particular class to whose society the writer happens to belong <\s>
<s> so much for what i have attempted i need not be assured that success is a very different matter particularly for one whose attention has but newly been awakened to the study of dramatic literature <\s>
<s> i endeavoured whilst at rome to observe such monuments of this story as might be accessible to a stranger <\s>
<s> the portrait of beatrice at the colonna palace is admirable as a work of art it was taken by guido during her confinement in prison <\s>
<s> but it is most interesting as a just representation of one of the loveliest specimens of the workmanship of nature <\s>
<s> there is a fixed and pale composure upon the features she seems sad and stricken down in spirit yet the despair thus expressed is lightened by the patience of gentleness <\s>
<s> her head is bound with folds of white drapery from which the yellow strings of her golden hair escape and fall about her neck <\s>
<s> the moulding of her face is exquisitely delicate the eyebrows are distinct and arched the lips have that permanent meaning of imagination and sensibility which suffering has not repressed and which it seems as if death scarcely could extinguish <\s>
<s> her forehead is large and clear her eyes which we are told were remarkable for their vivacity are swollen with weeping and lustreless but beautifully tender and serene <\s>
<s> in the whole mien there is a simplicity and dignity which united with her exquisite loveliness and deep sorrow are inexpressibly pathetic <\s>
<s> beatrice cenci appears to have been one of those rare persons in whom energy and gentleness dwell together without destroying one another her nature was simple and profound <\s>
<s> the crimes and miseries in which she was an actor and a sufferer are as the mask and the mantle in which circumstances clothed her for her impersonation on the scene of the world <\s>
<s> the cenci palace is of great extent and though in part modernized there yet remains a vast and gloomy pile of feudal architecture in the same state as during the dreadful scenes which are the subject of this tragedy <\s>
<s> the palace is situated in an obscure corner of rome near the quarter of the jews and from the upper windows you see the immense ruins of mount palatine half hidden under their profuse overgrowth of trees <\s>
<s> there is a court in one part of the palace perhaps that in which cenci built the chapel to st <\s>
<s> thomas supported by granite columns and adorned with antique friezes of fine workmanship and built up according to the ancient italian fashion with balcony over balcony of open work <\s>
<s> one of the gates of the palace formed of immense stones and leading through a passage dark and lofty and opening into gloomy subterranean chambers struck me particularly <\s>
<s> of the castle of petrella i could obtain no further information than that which is to be found in the manuscript <\s>

<s> camillo that matter of the murder is hushed up if you consent to yield his holiness your fief that lies beyond the pincian gate it needed all my interest in the conclave to bend him to this point he said that you 5 bought perilous impunity with your gold that crimes like yours if once or twice compounded enriched the church and respited from hell an erring soul which might repent and live but that the glory and the interest 10 of the high throne he fills little consist with making it a daily mart of guilt as manifold and hideous as the deeds which you scarce hide from men's revolted eyes <\s>
<s> cenci the third of my possessions let it go <\s>
<s> 15 ay i once heard the nephew of the pope had sent his architect to view the ground meaning to build a villa on my vines the next time i compounded with his uncle i little thought he should outwit me so <\s>

<s> no doubt pope clement and his most charitable nephews pray that the apostle peter and the saints will grant for their sake that i long enjoy 30 strength wealth and pride and lust and length of days wherein to act the deeds which are the stewards of their revenue but much yet remains to which they show no title <\s>
<s> camillo oh count cenci <\s>

<s> how hideously look deeds of lust and blood through those snow white and venerable hairs your children should be sitting round you now 40 but that you fear to read upon their looks the shame and misery you have written there <\s>
<s> where is your wife <\s>

<s> cenci for which aldobrandino owes you now my fief beyond the pincian cardinal one thing i pray you recollect henceforth and so we shall converse with less restraint <\s>
<s> 60 a man you knew spoke of my wife and daughter he was accustomed to frequent my house so the next day his wife and daughter came and asked if i had seen him and i smiled i think they never saw him any more <\s>
<s> 65 camillo thou execrable man beware cenci of thee <\s>
<s> nay this is idle we should know each other <\s>

<s> 80 but i delight in nothing else <\s>
<s> i love the sight of agony and the sense of joy when this shall be another's and that mine <\s>
<s> and i have no remorse and little fear which are i think the checks of other men <\s>
<s> 85 this mood has grown upon me until now any design my captious fancy makes the picture of its wish and it forms none but such as men like you would start to know is as my natural food and rest debarred 90 until it be accomplished <\s>
<s> camillo art thou not most miserable <\s>
<s> cenci why miserable no i am what your theologians call hardened which they must be in impudence so to revile a man's peculiar taste <\s>
<s> 95 true i was happier than i am while yet manhood remained to act the thing i thought while lust was sweeter than revenge and now invention palls ay we must all grow old and but that there remains a deed to act 100 whose horror might make sharp an appetite duller than mine i'd do i know not what <\s>

<s> note on the cenci by mrs <\s>
<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>
<s> the subject he had suggested for a tragedy was charles i and he had written to me remember remember charles i <\s>
<s> i have been already imagining how you would conduct some scenes <\s>
<s> the second volume of st <\s>
<s> leon begins with this proud and true sentiment there is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute <\s>
<s> shakespeare was only a human being <\s>
<s> these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted <\s>
<s> when in rome in 1819 a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci <\s>
<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> as i lay asleep in italy there came a voice from over the sea and with great power it forth led me to walk in the visions of poesy <\s>
<s> i met murder on the way 5 he had a mask like castlereagh very smooth he looked yet grim seven blood hounds followed him 3 <\s>
<s> all were fat and well they might be in admirable plight 10 for one by one and two by two he tossed them human hearts to chew which from his wide cloak he drew <\s>
<s> next came fraud and he had on like eldon an ermined gown 15 his big tears for he wept well turned to mill stones as they fell <\s>

<s> clothed with the bible as with light and the shadows of the night like sidmouth next hypocrisy on a crocodile rode by <\s>
<s> and many more destructions played in this ghastly masquerade all disguised even to the eyes like bishops lawyers peers or spies <\s>
<s> last came anarchy he rode 30 on a white horse splashed with blood he was pale even to the lips like death in the apocalypse <\s>
<s> and he wore a kingly crown and in his grasp a sceptre shone 35 on his brow this mark i saw i am god and king and law <\s>
<s> with a pace stately and fast over english land he passed trampling to a mire of blood 40 the adoring multitude <\s>
<s> and a mighty troop around with their trampling shook the ground waving each a bloody sword for the service of their lord <\s>
<s> and with glorious triumph they rode through england proud and gay drunk as with intoxication of the wine of desolation <\s>
<s> o'er fields and towns from sea to sea 50 passed the pageant swift and free tearing up and trampling down till they came to london town <\s>
<s> and each dweller panic stricken felt his heart with terror sicken 55 hearing the tempestuous cry of the triumph of anarchy <\s>
<s> for with pomp to meet him came clothed in arms like blood and flame the hired murderers who did sing 60 thou art god and law and king <\s>
<s> we have waited weak and lone for thy coming mighty one <\s>
<s> our purses are empty our swords are cold give us glory and blood and gold <\s>
<s> lawyers and priests a motley crowd to the earth their pale brows bowed like a bad prayer not over loud whispering 'thou art law and god 18 <\s>
<s> then all cried with one accord 70 thou art king and god and lord anarchy to thee we bow be thy name made holy now <\s>
<s> and anarchy the skeleton bowed and grinned to every one 75 as well as if his education had cost ten millions to the nation <\s>
<s> for he knew the palaces of our kings were rightly his his the sceptre crown and globe 80 and the gold inwoven robe <\s>
<s> so he sent his slaves before to seize upon the bank and tower and was proceeding with intent to meet his pensioned parliament 85 22 <\s>
<s> when one fled past a maniac maid and her name was hope she said but she looked more like despair and she cried out in the air 23 <\s>
<s> my father time is weak and gray 90 with waiting for a better day see how idiot like he stands fumbling with his palsied hands <\s>
<s> he has had child after child and the dust of death is piled 95 over every one but me misery oh misery <\s>
<s> then she lay down in the street right before the horses feet expecting with a patient eye 100 murder fraud and anarchy <\s>
<s> when between her and her foes a mist a light an image rose small at first and weak and frail like the vapour of a vale 105 27 <\s>
<s> till as clouds grow on the blast like tower crowned giants striding fast and glare with lightnings as they fly and speak in thunder to the sky 28 <\s>
<s> it grew a shape arrayed in mail 110 brighter than the viper's scale and upborne on wings whose grain was as the light of sunny rain <\s>
<s> on its helm seen far away a planet like the morning's lay 115 and those plumes its light rained through like a shower of crimson dew <\s>

<s> note on the mask of anarchy by mrs <\s>
<s> though shelley's first eager desire to excite his countrymen to resist openly the oppressions existent during the good old times had faded with early youth still his warmest sympathies were for the people <\s>
<s> he was a republican and loved a democracy <\s>
<s> he looked on all human beings as inheriting an equal right to possess the dearest privileges of our nature the necessaries of life when fairly earned by labour and intellectual instruction <\s>
<s> his hatred of any despotism that looked upon the people as not to be consulted or protected from want and ignorance was intense <\s>
<s> he was residing near leghorn at villa valsovano writing the cenci when the news of the manchester massacre reached us it roused in him violent emotions of indignation and compassion <\s>
<s> the great truth that the many if accordant and resolute could control the few as was shown some years after made him long to teach his injured countrymen how to resist <\s>
<s> inspired by these feelings he wrote the mask of anarchy which he sent to his friend leigh hunt to be inserted in the examiner of which he was then the editor <\s>
<s> i did not insert it leigh hunt writes in his valuable and interesting preface to this poem when he printed it in 1832 because i thought that the public at large had not become sufficiently discerning to do justice to the sincerity and kind heartedness of the spirit that walked in this flaming robe of verse <\s>
<s> days of outrage have passed away and with them the exasperation that would cause such an appeal to the many to be injurious <\s>
<s> without being aware of them they at one time acted on his suggestions and gained the day <\s>
<s> but they rose when human life was respected by the minister in power such was not the case during the administration which excited shelley's abhorrence <\s>
<s> the poem was written for the people and is therefore in a more popular tone than usual portions strike as abrupt and unpolished but many stanzas are all his own <\s>
<s> i heard him repeat and admired those beginning my father time is old and gray before i knew to what poem they were to belong <\s>
<s> but the most touching passage is that which describes the blessed effects of liberty it might make a patriot of any man whose heart was not wholly closed against his humbler fellow creatures <\s>

<s> shelley in the second edition of the poetical works 1839 <\s>
<s> a skit by john hamilton reynolds peter bell a lyrical ballad had already appeared april 1819 a few days before the publication of wordsworth's peter bell a tale <\s>
<s> these productions were reviewed in leigh hunt's examiner april 26 may 3 1819 ); and to the entertainment derived from his perusal of hunt's criticisms the composition of shelley's peter bell the third is chiefly owing dedication <\s>
<s> to thomas brown esq the younger h f <\s>
<s> dear tom allow me to request you to introduce mr <\s>
<s> peter bell to the respectable family of the fudges <\s>
<s> although he may fall short of those very considerable personages in the more active properties which characterize the rat and the apostate i suspect that even you their historian will confess that he surpasses them in the more peculiarly legitimate qualification of intolerable dulness <\s>
<s> examiner hunt well it was he who presented me to two of the mr <\s>
<s> my intimacy with the younger mr <\s>
<s> bell naturally sprung from this introduction to his brothers <\s>
<s> and in presenting him to you i have the satisfaction of being able to assure you that he is considerably the dullest of the three <\s>
<s> there is this particular advantage in an acquaintance with any one of the peter bells that if you know one peter bell you know three peter bells they are not one but three not three but one <\s>
<s> an awful mystery which after having caused torrents of blood and having been hymned by groans enough to deafen the music of the spheres is at length illustrated to the satisfaction of all parties in the theological world by the nature of mr <\s>
<s> peter is a polyhedric peter or a peter with many sides <\s>
<s> he changes colours like a chameleon and his coat like a snake <\s>
<s> he is a proteus of a peter <\s>
<s> he was at first sublime pathetic impressive profound then dull then prosy and dull and now dull oh so very dull <\s>
<s> it is an ultra legitimate dulness <\s>
<s> you will perceive that it is not necessary to consider hell and the devil as supernatural machinery <\s>
<s> the whole scene of my epic is in this world which is' so peter informed us before his conversion to white obi the world of all of us and where we find our happiness or not at all <\s>
<s> let me observe that i have spent six or seven days in composing this sublime piece the orb of my moonlike genius has made the fourth part of its revolution round the dull earth which you inhabit driving you mad while it has retained its calmness and its splendour and i have been fitting this its last phase to occupy a permanent station in the literature of my country <\s>
<s> your works indeed dear tom sell better but mine are far superior <\s>
<s> the public is no judge posterity sets all to rights <\s>
<s> allow me to observe that so much has been written of peter bell that the present history can be considered only like the iliad as a continuation of that series of cyclic poems which have already been candidates for bestowing immortality upon at the same time that they receive it from his character and adventures <\s>
<s> in this point of view i have violated no rule of syntax in beginning my composition with a conjunction the full stop which closes the poem continued by me being like the full stops at the end of the iliad and odyssey a full stop of a very qualified import <\s>
<s> hoping that the immortality which you have given to the fudges you will receive from them and in the firm expectation that when london shall be an habitation of bitterns when st <\s>
<s> paul's and westminster abbey shall stand shapeless and nameless ruins in the midst of an unpeopled marsh when the piers of waterloo bridge shall become the nuclei of islets of reeds and osiers and cast the jagged shadows of their broken arches on the solitary stream some transatlantic commentator will be weighing in the scales of some new and now unimagined system of criticism the respective merits of the bells and the fudges and their historians <\s>

<s> peter bell the first was peter smugger milder softer neater like the soul before it is born from that world into this <\s>
<s> 30 the next peter bell was he predevote like you and me to good or evil as may come his was the severer doom for he was an evil cotter 35 and a polygamic potter <\s>

<s> and peter bell when he had been with fresh imported hell fire warmed grew serious from his dress and mien twas very plainly to be seen peter was quite reformed <\s>
<s> his eyes turned up his mouth turned down his accent caught a nasal twang he oiled his hair there might be heard the grace of god in every word which peter said or sang <\s>
<s> but peter now grew old and had an ill no doctor could unravel his torments almost drove him mad some said it was a fever bad some swore it was the gravel <\s>
<s> his holy friends then came about and with long preaching and persuasion convinced the patient that without the smallest shadow of a doubt he was predestined to damnation <\s>
<s> they said 'thy name is peter bell thy skin is of a brimstone hue alive or dead ay sick or well the one god made to rhyme with hell the other i think rhymes with you <\s>
<s> then peter set up such a yell the nurse who with some water gruel was climbing up the stairs as well as her old legs could climb them fell and broke them both the fall was cruel <\s>

<s> and all the rest rushed through the door and tumbled over one another and broke their skulls upon the floor meanwhile sat peter bell and swore and cursed his father and his mother 40 9 <\s>
<s> and raved of god and sin and death blaspheming like an infidel and said that with his clenched teeth he'd seize the earth from underneath and drag it with him down to hell <\s>
<s> as he was speaking came a spasm and wrenched his gnashing teeth asunder like one who sees a strange phantasm he lay there was a silent chasm between his upper jaw and under <\s>
<s> and yellow death lay on his face and a fixed smile that was not human told as i understand the case that he was gone to the wrong place i heard all this from the old woman <\s>
<s> then there came down from langdale pike a cloud with lightning wind and hail it swept over the mountains like an ocean and i heard it strike the woods and crags of grasmere vale <\s>
<s> and i saw the black storm come nearer minute after minute its thunder made the cataracts dumb with hiss and clash and hollow hum it neared as if the devil was in it <\s>
<s> the devil was in it he had bought peter for half a crown and when the storm which bore him vanished nought that in the house that storm had caught was ever seen again <\s>
<s> the gaping neighbours came next day they found all vanished from the shore the bible whence he used to pray half scorched under a hen coop lay smashed glass and nothing more <\s>
<s> the devil i safely can aver has neither hoof nor tail nor sting nor is he as some sages swear a spirit neither here nor there in nothing yet in everything <\s>

<s> a thief who cometh in the night with whole boots and net pantaloons like some one whom it were not right to mention or the luckless wight from whom he steals nine silver spoons <\s>
<s> but in this case he did appear like a slop merchant from wapping and with smug face and eye severe on every side did perk and peer till he saw peter dead or napping <\s>
<s> he had on an upper benjamin for he was of the driving schism in the which he wrapped his skin from the storm he travelled in for fear of rheumatism <\s>
<s> he called the ghost out of the corse it was exceedingly like peter only its voice was hollow and hoarse it had a queerish look of course its dress too was a little neater <\s>
<s> the devil knew not his name and lot peter knew not that he was bell each had an upper stream of thought which made all seem as it was not fitting itself to all things well <\s>
<s> peter thought he had parents dear brothers sisters cousins cronies in the fens of lincolnshire he perhaps had found them there had he gone and boldly shown his 115 9 <\s>
<s> solemn phiz in his own village where he thought oft when a boy he'd clomb the orchard walls to pillage the produce of his neighbour's tillage with marvellous pride and joy <\s>

<s> that he had a mansion planned in a square like grosvenor square that he was aping fashion and that he now came to westmoreland 130 to see what was romantic there <\s>
<s> and all this though quite ideal ready at a breath to vanish was a state not more unreal than the peace he could not feel 135 or the care he could not banish <\s>
<s> after a little conversation the devil told peter if he chose he'd bring him to the world of fashion by giving him a situation 140 in his own service and new clothes <\s>
<s> and peter bowed quite pleased and proud and after waiting some few days for a new livery dirty yellow turned up with black the wretched fellow 145 was bowled to hell in the devil's chaise <\s>

<s> but peter though now damned was not what peter was before damnation <\s>
<s> men oftentimes prepare a lot 270 which ere it finds them is not what suits with their genuine station <\s>
<s> all things that peter saw and felt had a peculiar aspect to him and when they came within the belt 275 of his own nature seemed to melt like cloud to cloud into him <\s>
<s> and so the outward world uniting to that within him he became considerably uninviting 280 to those who meditation slighting were moulded in a different frame <\s>
<s> and he scorned them and they scorned him and he scorned all they did and they did all that men of their own trim 285 are wont to do to please their whim drinking lying swearing play <\s>
<s> such were his fellow servants thus his virtue like our own was built too much on that indignant fuss 290 hypocrite pride stirs up in us to bully one another's guilt <\s>
<s> he had a mind which was somehow at once circumference and centre of all he might or feel or know 295 nothing went ever out although something did ever enter <\s>
<s> he had as much imagination as a pint pot he never could fancy another situation 300 from which to dart his contemplation than that wherein he stood <\s>
<s> yet his was individual mind and new created all he saw in a new manner and refined 305 those new creations and combined them by a master spirit's law <\s>
<s> thus though unimaginative an apprehension clear intense of his mind's work had made alive 310 the things it wrought on i believe wakening a sort of thought in sense <\s>
<s> but from the first twas peter's drift to be a kind of moral eunuch he touched the hem of nature's shift 315 felt faint and never dared uplift the closest all concealing tunic <\s>
<s> she laughed the while with an arch smile and kissed him with a sister's kiss and said my best diogenes 320 i love you well but if you please tempt not again my deepest bliss <\s>
<s> tis you are cold for i not coy yield love for love frank warm and true and burns a scottish peasant boy 325 his errors prove it knew my joy more learned friend than you <\s>
<s> boeca bacciata non perde ventura anzi rinnuova come fa la luna so thought boccaccio whose sweet words might cure a 330 male prude like you from what you now endure a low tide in soul like a stagnant laguna <\s>
<s> then peter rubbed his eyes severe <\s>
<s> and smoothed his spacious forehead down with his broad palm twixt love and fear 335 he looked as he no doubt felt queer and in his dream sate down <\s>
<s> the devil was no uncommon creature a leaden witted thief just huddled out of the dross and scum of nature 340 a toad like lump of limb and feature with mind and heart and fancy muddled <\s>
<s> he was that heavy dull cold thing the spirit of evil well may be a drone too base to have a sting 345 who gluts and grimes his lazy wing and calls lust luxury <\s>
<s> now he was quite the kind of wight round whom collect at a fixed aera venison turtle hock and claret 350 good cheer and those who come to share it and best east indian madeira <\s>
<s> it was his fancy to invite men of science wit and learning who came to lend each other light 355 he proudly thought that his gold's might had set those spirits burning <\s>
<s> and men of learning science wit considered him as you and i think of some rotten tree and sit 360 lounging and dining under it exposed to the wide sky <\s>
<s> and all the while with loose fat smile the willing wretch sat winking there believing twas his power that made 365 that jovial scene and that all paid homage to his unnoticed chair <\s>
<s> though to be sure this place was hell he was the devil and all they what though the claret circled well 370 and wit like ocean rose and fell were damned eternally <\s>
<s> among the guests who often stayed till the devil's petits soupers a man there came fair as a maid 375 and peter noted what he said standing behind his master's chair <\s>
<s> he was a mighty poet and a subtle souled psychologist all things he seemed to understand 380 of old or new of sea or land but his own mind which was a mist <\s>
<s> this was a man who might have turned hell into heaven and so in gladness a heaven unto himself have earned 385 but he in shadows undiscerned trusted and damned himself to madness <\s>
<s> he spoke of poetry and how divine it was a light a love a spirit which like wind doth blow 390 as it listeth to and fro a dew rained down from god above 5 <\s>
<s> a power which comes and goes like dream and which none can ever trace heaven's light on earth truth's brightest beam <\s>
<s> 395 and when he ceased there lay the gleam of those words upon his face <\s>
<s> now peter when he heard such talk would heedless of a broken pate stand like a man asleep or balk 400 some wishing guest of knife or fork or drop and break his master's plate <\s>
<s> at night he oft would start and wake like a lover and began in a wild measure songs to make 405 on moor and glen and rocky lake and on the heart of man 8 <\s>
<s> and on the universal sky and the wide earth's bosom green and the sweet strange mystery 410 of what beyond these things may lie and yet remain unseen <\s>
<s> for in his thought he visited the spots in which ere dead and damned he his wayward life had led 415 yet knew not whence the thoughts were fed which thus his fancy crammed <\s>
<s> and these obscure remembrances stirred such harmony in peter that whensoever he should please 420 he could speak of rocks and trees in poetic metre <\s>
<s> for though it was without a sense of memory yet he remembered well many a ditch and quick set fence 425 of lakes he had intelligence he knew something of heath and fell <\s>
<s> he had also dim recollections of pedlars tramping on their rounds milk pans and pails and odd collections 430 of saws and proverbs and reflections old parsons make in burying grounds <\s>
<s> but peter's verse was clear and came announcing from the frozen hearth of a cold age that none might tame 435 the soul of that diviner flame it augured to the earth 14 <\s>
<s> like gentle rains on the dry plains making that green which late was gray or like the sudden moon that stains 440 some gloomy chamber's window panes with a broad light like day <\s>
<s> for language was in peter's hand like clay while he was yet a potter and he made songs for all the land 445 sweet both to feel and understand as pipkins late to mountain cotter <\s>
<s> the bookseller gave twenty pounds for some then scorning a footman's yellow coat to wear 450 peter too proud of heart i fear instantly gave the devil warning <\s>
<s> whereat the devil took offence and swore in his soul a great oath then that for his damned impertinence 455 he'd bring him to a proper sense of what was due to gentlemen <\s>
<s> o that mine enemy had written a book cried job a fearful curse if to the arab as the briton 460 twas galling to be critic bitten the devil to peter wished no worse <\s>
<s> when peter's next new book found vent the devil to all the first reviews a copy of it slyly sent 465 with five pound note as compliment and this short notice 'pray abuse <\s>

<s> for peter did not know the town but thought as country readers do for half a guinea or a crown 510 he bought oblivion or renown from god's own voice 1 in a review <\s>
<s> all peter did on this occasion was writing some sad stuff in prose <\s>

<s> the devil then sent to leipsic fair for born's translation of kant's book a world of words tail foremost where 520 right wrong false true and foul and fair as in a lottery wheel are shook <\s>

<s> after these ghastly rides he came home to his heart and found from thence 560 much stolen of its accustomed flame his thoughts grew weak drowsy and lame of their intelligence <\s>
<s> to peter's view all seemed one hue he was no whig he was no tory 565 no deist and no christian he he got so subtle that to be nothing was all his glory <\s>

<s> his morals thus were undermined the old peter the hard old potter 580 was born anew within his mind he grew dull harsh sly unrefined as when he tramped beside the otter <\s>
<s> in the death hues of agony lambently flashing from a fish 585 now peter felt amused to see shades like a rainbow's rise and flee mixed with a certain hungry wish 2 <\s>

<s> in this new edition i have added peter bell the third <\s>
<s> a critique on wordsworth's peter bell reached us at leghorn which amused shelley exceedingly and suggested this poem <\s>
<s> i need scarcely observe that nothing personal to the author of peter bell is intended in this poem <\s>
<s> no man ever admired wordsworth's poetry more he read it perpetually and taught others to appreciate its beauties <\s>
<s> this poem is like all others written by shelley ideal <\s>
<s> he conceived the idealism of a poet a man of lofty and creative genius quitting the glorious calling of discovering and announcing the beautiful and good to support and propagate ignorant prejudices and pernicious errors imparting to the unenlightened not that ardour for truth and spirit of toleration which shelley looked on as the sources of the moral improvement and happiness of mankind but false and injurious opinions that evil was good and that ignorance and force were the best allies of purity and virtue <\s>
<s> his idea was that a man gifted even as transcendently as the author of peter bell with the highest qualities of genius must if he fostered such errors be infected with dulness <\s>
<s> this poem was written as a warning not as a narration of the reality <\s>
<s> he was unacquainted personally with wordsworth or with coleridge to whom he alludes in the fifth part of the poem and therefore i repeat his poem is purely ideal it contains something of criticism on the compositions of those great poets but nothing injurious to the men themselves <\s>
<s> no poem contains more of shelley's peculiar views with regard to the errors into which many of the wisest have fallen and the pernicious effects of certain opinions on society <\s>
<s> much of it is beautifully written and though like the burlesque drama of swellfoot it must be looked on as a plaything it has so much merit and poetry so much of himself in it that it cannot fail to interest greatly and by right belongs to the world for whose instruction and benefit it was written <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>
<s> oedipus tyrannus or swellfoot the tyrant <\s>
<s> a tragedy in two acts translated from the original doric <\s>
<s> choose reform or civil war when through thy streets instead of hare with dogs a consort queen shall hunt a king with hogs riding on the ionian minotaur <\s>
<s> begun at the baths of san giuliano near pisa august 24 1819 published anonymously by j <\s>
<s> johnston cheapside imprint c f <\s>
<s> on a threat of prosecution the publisher surrendered the whole impression seven copies the total number sold excepted <\s>
<s> oedipus does not appear in the first edition of the poetical works 1839 but it was included by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley in the second edition of that year <\s>
<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>
<s> should the remaining portions of this tragedy be found entitled swellfoot in angaria and charite the translator might be tempted to give them to the reading public <\s>
<s> tyrant swellfoot king of thebes <\s>
<s> iona taurina his queen <\s>
<s> mammon arch priest of famine <\s>
<s> purganax dakry laoctonos wizards ministers of swellfoot <\s>

<s> the poem of hellas written at the suggestion of the events of the moment is a mere improvise and derives its interest should it be found to possess any solely from the intense sympathy which the author feels with the cause he would celebrate <\s>
<s> the subject in its present state is insusceptible of being treated otherwise than lyrically and if i have called this poem a drama from the circumstance of its being composed in dialogue the licence is not greater than that which has been assumed by other poets who have called their productions epics only because they have been divided into twelve or twenty four books <\s>
<s> the persae of aeschylus afforded me the first model of my conception although the decision of the glorious contest now waging in greece being yet suspended forbids a catastrophe parallel to the return of xerxes and the desolation of the persians <\s>
<s> i have therefore contented myself with exhibiting a series of lyric pictures and with having wrought upon the curtain of futurity which falls upon the unfinished scene such figures of indistinct and visionary delineation as suggest the final triumph of the greek cause as a portion of the cause of civilisation and social improvement <\s>
<s> the drama if drama it must be called is however so inartificial that i doubt whether if recited on the thespian waggon to an athenian village at the dionysiaca it would have obtained the prize of the goat <\s>
<s> i shall bear with equanimity any punishment greater than the loss of such a reward which the aristarchi of the hour may think fit to inflict <\s>
<s> the only goat song which i have yet attempted has i confess in spite of the unfavourable nature of the subject received a greater and a more valuable portion of applause than i expected or than it deserved <\s>
<s> common fame is the only authority which i can allege for the details which form the basis of the poem and i must trespass upon the forgiveness of my readers for the display of newspaper erudition to which i have been reduced <\s>
<s> undoubtedly until the conclusion of the war it will be impossible to obtain an account of it sufficiently authentic for historical materials but poets have their privilege and it is unquestionable that actions of the most exalted courage have been performed by the greeks that they have gained more than one naval victory and that their defeat in wallachia was signalized by circumstances of heroism more glorious even than victory <\s>
<s> the apathy of the rulers of the civilised world to the astonishing circumstance of the descendants of that nation to which they owe their civilisation rising as it were from the ashes of their ruin is something perfectly inexplicable to a mere spectator of the shows of this mortal scene <\s>
<s> we are all greeks <\s>
<s> our laws our literature our religion our arts have their root in greece <\s>
<s> but for greece rome the instructor the conqueror or the metropolis of our ancestors would have spread no illumination with her arms and we might still have been savages and idolaters or what is worse might have arrived at such a stagnant and miserable state of social institution as china and japan possess <\s>
<s> the human form and the human mind attained to a perfection in greece which has impressed its image on those faultless productions whose very fragments are the despair of modern art and has propagated impulses which cannot cease through a thousand channels of manifest or imperceptible operation to ennoble and delight mankind until the extinction of the race <\s>
<s> the modern greek is the descendant of those glorious beings whom the imagination almost refuses to figure to itself as belonging to our kind and he inherits much of their sensibility their rapidity of conception their enthusiasm and their courage <\s>
<s> if in many instances he is degraded by moral and political slavery to the practice of the basest vices it engenders and that below the level of ordinary degradation let us reflect that the corruption of the best produces the worst and that habits which subsist only in relation to a peculiar state of social institution may be expected to cease as soon as that relation is dissolved <\s>
<s> in fact the greeks since the admirable novel of anastasius could have been a faithful picture of their manners have undergone most important changes the flower of their youth returning to their country from the universities of italy germany and france have communicated to their fellow citizens the latest results of that social perfection of which their ancestors were the original source <\s>
<s> the university of chios contained before the breaking out of the revolution eight hundred students and among them several germans and americans <\s>
<s> the munificence and energy of many of the greek princes and merchants directed to the renovation of their country with a spirit and a wisdom which has few examples is above all praise <\s>
<s> the english permit their own oppressors to act according to their natural sympathy with the turkish tyrant and to brand upon their name the indelible blot of an alliance with the enemies of domestic happiness of christianity and civilisation <\s>
<s> russia desires to possess not to liberate greece and is contented to see the turks its natural enemies and the greeks its intended slaves enfeeble each other until one or both fall into its net <\s>
<s> the wise and generous policy of england would have consisted in establishing the independence of greece and in maintaining it both against russia and the turk but when was the oppressor generous or just <\s>
<s> should the english people ever become free they will reflect upon the part which those who presume to represent their will have played in the great drama of the revival of liberty with feelings which it would become them to anticipate <\s>
<s> this is the age of the war of the oppressed against the oppressors and every one of those ringleaders of the privileged gangs of murderers and swindlers called sovereigns look to each other for aid against the common enemy and suspend their mutual jealousies in the presence of a mightier fear <\s>

<s> let it not be supposed that i mean to dogmatise upon a subject concerning which all men are equally ignorant or that i think the gordian knot of the origin of evil can be disentangled by that or any similar assertions <\s>
<s> the received hypothesis of a being resembling men in the moral attributes of his nature having called us out of non existence and after inflicting on us the misery of the commission of error should superadd that of the punishment and the privations consequent upon it still would remain inexplicable and incredible <\s>
<s> that there is a true solution of the riddle and that in our present state that solution is unattainable by us are propositions which may be regarded as equally certain meanwhile as it is the province of the poet to attach himself to those ideas which exalt and ennoble humanity let him be permitted to have conjectured the condition of that futurity towards which we are all impelled by an inextinguishable thirst for immortality <\s>
<s> until better arguments can be produced than sophisms which disgrace the cause this desire itself must remain the strongest and the only presumption that eternity is the inheritance of every thinking being <\s>

<s> the grecian gods seem indeed to have been personally more innocent although it cannot be said that as far as temperance and chastity are concerned they gave so edifying an example as their successor <\s>
<s> the sublime human character of jesus christ was deformed by an imputed identification with a power who tempted betrayed and punished the innocent beings who were called into existence by his sole will and for the period of a thousand years the spirit of this most just wise and benevolent of men has been propitiated with myriads of hecatombs of those who approached the nearest to his innocence and wisdom sacrificed under every aggravation of atrocity and variety of torture <\s>

<s> note on hellas by mrs <\s>
<s> the south of europe was in a state of great political excitement at the beginning of the year 1821 <\s>
<s> the spanish revolution had been a signal to italy secrete societies were formed and when naples rose to declare the constitution the call was responded to from brundusium to the foot of the alps <\s>
<s> to crush these attempts to obtain liberty early in 1821 the austrians poured their armies into the peninsula at first their coming rather seemed to add energy and resolution to a people long enslaved <\s>
<s> the piedmontese asserted their freedom genoa threw off the yoke of the king of sardinia and as if in playful imitation the people of the little state of massa and carrara gave the conge to their sovereign and set up a republic <\s>
<s> tuscany alone was perfectly tranquil <\s>
<s> it was said that the austrian minister presented a list of sixty carbonari to the grand duke urging their imprisonment and the grand duke replied i do not know whether these sixty men are carbonari but i know if i imprison them i shall directly have sixty thousand start up <\s>
<s> but though the tuscans had no desire to disturb the paternal government beneath whose shelter they slumbered they regarded the progress of the various italian revolutions with intense interest and hatred for the austrian was warm in every bosom <\s>
<s> but they had slender hopes they knew that the neapolitans would offer no fit resistance to the regular german troops and that the overthrow of the constitution in naples would act as a decisive blow against all struggles for liberty in italy <\s>
<s> we have seen the rise and progress of reform <\s>
<s> but the holy alliance was alive and active in those days and few could dream of the peaceful triumph of liberty <\s>
<s> it seemed then that the armed assertion of freedom in the south of europe was the only hope of the liberals as if it prevailed the nations of the north would imitate the example <\s>
<s> happily the reverse has proved the fact <\s>
<s> the countries accustomed to the exercise of the privileges of freemen to a limited extent have extended and are extending these limits <\s>
<s> freedom and knowledge have now a chance of proceeding hand in hand and if it continue thus we may hope for the durability of both <\s>
<s> then as i have said in 1821 shelley as well as every other lover of liberty looked upon the struggles in spain and italy as decisive of the destinies of the world probably for centuries to come <\s>
<s> the interest he took in the progress of affairs was intense <\s>
<s> when genoa declared itself free his hopes were at their highest <\s>
<s> day after day he read the bulletins of the austrian army and sought eagerly to gather tokens of its defeat <\s>
<s> he heard of the revolt of genoa with emotions of transport <\s>
<s> his whole heart and soul were in the triumph of the cause <\s>
<s> we were living at pisa at that time and several well informed italians at the head of whom we may place the celebrated vacca were accustomed to seek for sympathy in their hopes from shelley they did not find such for the despair they too generally experienced founded on contempt for their southern countrymen <\s>
<s> while the fate of the progress of the austrian armies then invading naples was yet in suspense the news of another revolution filled him with exultation <\s>
<s> we had formed the acquaintance at pisa of several constantinopolitan greeks of the family of prince caradja formerly hospodar of wallachia who hearing that the bowstring the accustomed finale of his viceroyalty was on the road to him escaped with his treasures and took up his abode in tuscany <\s>
<s> among these was the gentleman to whom the drama of hellas is dedicated <\s>
<s> prince mavrocordato was warmed by those aspirations for the independence of his country which filled the hearts of many of his countrymen <\s>
<s> he often intimated the possibility of an insurrection in greece but we had no idea of its being so near at hand when on the 1st of april 1821 he called on shelley bringing the proclamation of his cousin prince ypsilanti and radiant with exultation and delight declared that henceforth greece would be free <\s>
<s> shelley had hymned the dawn of liberty in spain and naples in two odes dictated by the warmest enthusiasm he felt himself naturally impelled to decorate with poetry the uprise of the descendants of that people whose works he regarded with deep admiration and to adopt the vaticinatory character in prophesying their success <\s>
<s> hellas was written in a moment of enthusiasm <\s>
<s> it is curious to remark how well he overcomes the difficulty of forming a drama out of such scant materials <\s>
<s> his prophecies indeed came true in their general not their particular purport <\s>
<s> he did not foresee the death of lord londonderry which was to be the epoch of a change in english politics particularly as regarded foreign affairs nor that the navy of his country would fight for instead of against the greeks and by the battle of navarino secure their enfranchisement from the turks <\s>
<s> almost against reason as it appeared to him he resolved to believe that greece would prove triumphant and in this spirit auguring ultimate good yet grieving over the vicissitudes to be endured in the interval he composed his drama <\s>
<s> hellas was among the last of his compositions and is among the most beautiful <\s>
<s> the choruses are singularly imaginative and melodious in their versification <\s>
<s> there are some stanzas that beautifully exemplify shelley's peculiar style as for instance the assertion of the intellectual empire which must be for ever the inheritance of the country of homer sophocles and plato but greece and her foundations are built below the tide of war based on the crystalline sea of thought and its eternity <\s>
<s> and again that philosophical truth felicitously imaged forth revenge and wrong bring forth their kind the foul cubs like their parents are their den is in the guilty mind and conscience feeds them with despair <\s>
<s> the conclusion of the last chorus is among the most beautiful of his lyrics <\s>
<s> the imagery is distinct and majestic the prophecy such as poets love to dwell upon the regeneration of mankind and that regeneration reflecting back splendour on the foregone time from which it inherits so much of intellectual wealth and memory of past virtuous deeds as must render the possession of happiness and peace of tenfold value <\s>

<s> 160 and day by day green as a gourd in june the plant grew fresh and thick yet no one knew what plant it was its stem and tendrils seemed like emerald snakes mottled and diamonded with azure mail and streaks of woven silver 165 and all the sheaths that folded the dark buds rose like the crest of cobra di capel until the golden eye of the bright flower through the dark lashes of those veined lids ... disencumbered of their silent sleep 170 gazed like a star into the morning light <\s>

<s> day by day i nursed the plant and on the double flute 180 played to it on the sunny winter days soft melodies as sweet as april rain on silent leaves and sang those words in which passion makes echo taunt the sleeping strings and i would send tales of forgotten love 185 late into the lone night and sing wild songs of maids deserted in the olden time and weep like a soft cloud in april's bosom upon the sleeping eyelids of the plant so that perhaps it dreamed that spring was come 190 and crept abroad into the moonlight air and loosened all its limbs as noon by noon the sun averted less his oblique beam <\s>
<s> indian and the plant died not in the frost <\s>
<s> lady it grew and went out of the lattice which i left 195 half open for it trailing its quaint spires along the garden and across the lawn and down the slope of moss and through the tufts of wild flower roots and stumps of trees o'ergrown with simple lichens and old hoary stones 200 on to the margin of the glassy pool even to a nook of unblown violets and lilies of the valley yet unborn under a pine with ivy overgrown <\s>
<s> and theme its fruit lay like a sleeping lizard 205 under the shadows but when spring indeed came to unswathe her infants and the lilies peeped from their bright green masks to wonder at this shape of autumn couched in their recess then it dilated and it grew until 210 one half lay floating on the fountain wave whose pulse elapsed in unlike sympathies kept time among the snowy water lily buds <\s>
<s> its shape was such as summer melody 215 of the south wind in spicy vales might give to some light cloud bound from the golden dawn to fairy isles of evening and it seemed in hue and form that it had been a mirror of all the hues and forms around it and 220 upon it pictured by the sunny beams which from the bright vibrations of the pool were thrown upon the rafters and the roof of boughs and leaves and on the pillared stems of the dark sylvan temple and reflections 225 of every infant flower and star of moss and veined leaf in the azure odorous air <\s>
<s> and thus it lay in the elysian calm of its own beauty floating on the line which like a film in purest space divided 230 the heaven beneath the water from the heaven above the clouds and every day i went watching its growth and wondering and as the day grew hot methought i saw a glassy vapour dancing on the pool 235 and on it little quaint and filmy shapes <\s>

<s> note on the early poems by mrs <\s>
<s> the remainder of shelley's poems will be arranged in the order in which they were written <\s>
<s> of course mistakes will occur in placing some of the shorter ones for as i have said many of these were thrown aside and i never saw them till i had the misery of looking over his writings after the hand that traced them was dust and some were in the hands of others and i never saw them till now <\s>
<s> the subjects of the poems are often to me an unerring guide but on other occasions i can only guess by finding them in the pages of the same manuscript book that contains poems with the date of whose composition i am fully conversant <\s>
<s> in the present arrangement all his poetical translations will be placed together at the end <\s>
<s> the loss of his early papers prevents my being able to give any of the poetry of his boyhood <\s>
<s> of the few i give as early poems the greater part were published with alastor some of them were written previously some at the same period <\s>
<s> the poem beginning oh there are spirits in the air was addressed in idea to coleridge whom he never knew and at whose character he could only guess imperfectly through his writings and accounts he heard of him from some who knew him well <\s>
<s> he regarded his change of opinions as rather an act of will than conviction and believed that in his inner heart he would be haunted by what shelley considered the better and holier aspirations of his youth <\s>
<s> the summer evening that suggested to him the poem written in the churchyard of lechlade occurred during his voyage up the thames in 1815 <\s>
<s> he had been advised by a physician to live as much as possible in the open air and a fortnight of a bright warm july was spent in tracing the thames to its source <\s>
<s> he never spent a season more tranquilly than the summer of 1815 <\s>
<s> he had just recovered from a severe pulmonary attack the weather was warm and pleasant <\s>
<s> he lived near windsor forest and his life was spent under its shades or on the water meditating subjects for verse <\s>
<s> hitherto he had chiefly aimed at extending his political doctrines and attempted so to do by appeals in prose essays to the people exhorting them to claim their rights but he had now begun to feel that the time for action was not ripe in england and that the pen was the only instrument wherewith to prepare the way for better things <\s>
<s> in the scanty journals kept during those years i find a record of the books that shelley read during several years <\s>
<s> during the years of 1814 and 1815 the list is extensive <\s>
<s> it includes in greek homer hesiod theocritus the histories of thucydides and herodotus and diogenes laertius <\s>
<s> in latin petronius suetonius some of the works of cicero a large proportion of those of seneca and livy <\s>

<s> none may know the sweetness of the joy which made his breath 5 fail like the trances of the summer air when with the lady of his love who then first knew the unreserve of mingled being he walked along the pathway of a field which to the east a hoar wood shadowed o'er 10 but to the west was open to the sky <\s>
<s> there now the sun had sunk but lines of gold hung on the ashen clouds and on the points of the far level grass and nodding flowers and the old dandelion's hoary beard 15 and mingled with the shades of twilight lay on the brown massy woods and in the east the broad and burning moon lingeringly rose between the black trunks of the crowded trees while the faint stars were gathering overhead 20 is it not strange isabel said the youth i never saw the sun <\s>

<s> the awful shadow of some unseen power floats though unseen among us visiting this various world with as inconstant wing as summer winds that creep from flower to flower like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower 5 it visits with inconstant glance each human heart and countenance like hues and harmonies of evening like clouds in starlight widely spread like memory of music fled 10 like aught that for its grace may be dear and yet dearer for its mystery <\s>

<s> while yet a boy i sought for ghosts and sped through many a listening chamber cave and ruin 50 and starlight wood with fearful steps pursuing hopes of high talk with the departed dead <\s>
<s> i called on poisonous names with which our youth is fed i was not heard i saw them not when musing deeply on the lot 55 of life at that sweet time when winds are wooing all vital things that wake to bring news of birds and blossoming sudden thy shadow fell on me i shrieked and clasped my hands in ecstasy <\s>

<s> thus thou ravine of arve dark deep ravine thou many coloured many voiced vale over whose pines and crags and caverns sail fast cloud shadows and sunbeams awful scene 15 where power in likeness of the arve comes down from the ice gulfs that gird his secret throne bursting through these dark mountains like the flame of lightning through the tempest thou dost lie thy giant brood of pines around thee clinging 20 children of elder time in whose devotion the chainless winds still come and ever came to drink their odours and their mighty swinging to hear an old and solemn harmony thine earthly rainbows stretched across the sweep 25 of the ethereal waterfall whose veil robes some unsculptured image the strange sleep which when the voices of the desert fail wraps all in its own deep eternity thy caverns echoing to the arve's commotion 30 a loud lone sound no other sound can tame thou art pervaded with that ceaseless motion thou art the path of that unresting sound dizzy ravine <\s>
<s> and when i gaze on thee i seem as in a trance sublime and strange 35 to muse on my own separate fantasy my own my human mind which passively now renders and receives fast influencings holding an unremitting interchange with the clear universe of things around 40 one legion of wild thoughts whose wandering wings now float above thy darkness and now rest where that or thou art no unbidden guest in the still cave of the witch poesy seeking among the shadows that pass by 45 ghosts of all things that are some shade of thee some phantom some faint image till the breast from which they fled recalls them thou art there <\s>
<s> some say that gleams of a remoter world visit the soul in sleep that death is slumber 50 and that its shapes the busy thoughts outnumber of those who wake and live i look on high has some unknown omnipotence unfurled the veil of life and death <\s>

<s> note on poems of 1816 by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley wrote little during this year <\s>
<s> the poem entitled the sunset was written in the spring of the year while still residing at bishopsgate <\s>
<s> he spent the summer on the shores of the lake of geneva <\s>
<s> the hymn to intellectual beauty was conceived during his voyage round the lake with lord byron <\s>
<s> he occupied himself during this voyage by reading the nouvelle heloise for the first time <\s>
<s> the reading it on the very spot where the scenes are laid added to the interest and he was at once surprised and charmed by the passionate eloquence and earnest enthralling interest that pervade this work <\s>
<s> there was something in the character of saint preux in his abnegation of self and in the worship he paid to love that coincided with shelley's own disposition and though differing in many of the views and shocked by others yet the effect of the whole was fascinating and delightful <\s>
<s> mont blanc was inspired by a view of that mountain and its surrounding peaks and valleys as he lingered on the bridge of arve on his way through the valley of chamouni <\s>
<s> shelley makes the following mention of this poem in his publication of the history of a six weeks tour and letters from switzerland the poem entitled mont blanc is written by the author of the two letters from chamouni and vevai <\s>
<s> it was composed under the immediate impression of the deep and powerful feelings excited by the objects which it attempts to describe and as an undisciplined overflowing of the soul rests its claim to approbation on an attempt to imitate the untamable wildness and inaccessible solemnity from which those feelings sprang <\s>
<s> this was an eventful year and less time was given to study than usual <\s>
<s> in the list of his reading i find in greek theocritus the prometheus of aeschylus several of plutarch's lives and the works of lucian <\s>
<s> in latin lucretius pliny's letters the annals and germany of tacitus <\s>
<s> in french the history of the french revolution by lacretelle <\s>
<s> he read for the first time this year montaigne's essays and regarded them ever after as one of the most delightful and instructive books in the world <\s>
<s> the list is scanty in english works locke's essay political justice and coleridge's lay sermon form nearly the whole <\s>
<s> it was his frequent habit to read aloud to me in the evening in this way we read this year the new testament paradise lost spenser's faery queen and don quixote <\s>
<s> poems written in 1817 <\s>
<s> composed at marlow 1817 <\s>
<s> published in hunt's literary pocket book 1819 and reprinted in posthumous poems 1824 1 <\s>
<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>
<s> the plank whereon that lady sate was driven through the chasms about and about between the peaks so desolate 100 of the drowning mountains in and out as the thistle beard on a whirlwind sails while the flood was filling those hollow vales <\s>
<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>
<s> the dizzy flight of that phantom pale waked the fair lady from her sleep and she arose while from the veil of her dark eyes the dream did creep and she walked about as one who knew 145 that sleep has sights as clear and true as any waking eyes can view <\s>

<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>
<s> he did not hesitate to resolve if such were menaced to abandon country fortune everything and to escape with his child and i find some unfinished stanzas addressed to this son whom afterwards we lost at rome written under the idea that we might suddenly be forced to cross the sea so to preserve him <\s>
<s> this poem as well as the one previously quoted were not written to exhibit the pangs of distress to the public they were the spontaneous outbursts of a man who brooded over his wrongs and woes and was impelled to shed the grace of his genius over the uncontrollable emotions of his heart <\s>
<s> i ought to observe that the fourth verse of this effusion is introduced in rosalind and helen <\s>
<s> when afterwards this child died at rome he wrote a propos of the english burying ground in that city this spot is the repository of a sacred loss of which the yearnings of a parent's heart are now prophetic he is rendered immortal by love as his memory is by death <\s>
<s> my beloved child lies buried here <\s>

<s> i see the deep's untrampled floor 10 with green and purple seaweeds strown i see the waves upon the shore like light dissolved in star showers thrown i sit upon the sands alone the lightning of the noontide ocean 15 is flashing round me and a tone arises from its measured motion how sweet <\s>

<s> yet now despair itself is mild even as the winds and waters are i could lie down like a tired child 30 and weep away the life of care which i have borne and yet must bear till death like sleep might steal on me and i might feel in the warm air my cheek grow cold and hear the sea 35 breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony <\s>
<s> some might lament that i were cold as i when this sweet day is gone which my lost heart too soon grown old insults with this untimely moan 40 they might lament for i am one whom men love not and yet regret unlike this day which when the sun shall on its stainless glory set will linger though enjoyed like joy in memory yet <\s>

<s> and so this man returned with axe and saw 40 at evening close from killing the tall treen the soul of whom by nature's gentle law was each a wood nymph and kept ever green the pavement and the roof of the wild copse chequering the sunlight of the blue serene 45 with jagged leaves and from the forest tops singing the winds to sleep or weeping oft fast showers of aereal water drops into their mother's bosom sweet and soft nature's pure tears which have no bitterness 50 around the cradles of the birds aloft they spread themselves into the loveliness of fan like leaves and over pallid flowers hang like moist clouds or where high branches kiss make a green space among the silent bowers 55 like a vast fane in a metropolis surrounded by the columns and the towers all overwrought with branch like traceries in which there is religion and the mute persuasion of unkindled melodies 60 odours and gleams and murmurs which the lute of the blind pilot spirit of the blast stirs as it sails now grave and now acute wakening the leaves and waves ere it has passed to such brief unison as on the brain 65 one tone which never can recur has cast one accent never to return again <\s>

<s> note on poems of 1818 by mrs <\s>
<s> we often hear of persons disappointed by a first visit to italy <\s>
<s> this was not shelley's case <\s>
<s> the aspect of its nature its sunny sky its majestic storms of the luxuriant vegetation of the country and the noble marble built cities enchanted him <\s>
<s> the sight of the works of art was full enjoyment and wonder <\s>
<s> he had not studied pictures or statues before he now did so with the eye of taste that referred not to the rules of schools but to those of nature and truth <\s>
<s> the first entrance to rome opened to him a scene of remains of antique grandeur that far surpassed his expectations and the unspeakable beauty of naples and its environs added to the impression he received of the transcendent and glorious beauty of italy <\s>
<s> our winter was spent at naples <\s>
<s> here he wrote the fragments of marenghi and the woodman and the nightingale which he afterwards threw aside <\s>
<s> at this time shelley suffered greatly in health <\s>
<s> he put himself under the care of a medical man who promised great things and made him endure severe bodily pain without any good results <\s>
<s> constant and poignant physical suffering exhausted him and though he preserved the appearance of cheerfulness and often greatly enjoyed our wanderings in the environs of naples and our excursions on its sunny sea yet many hours were passed when his thoughts shadowed by illness became gloomy and then he escaped to solitude and in verses which he hid from fear of wounding me poured forth morbid but too natural bursts of discontent and sadness <\s>

<s> thou dirge of the dying year to which this closing night will be the dome of a vast sepulchre 25 vaulted with all thy congregated might of vapours from whose solid atmosphere black rain and fire and hail will burst oh hear <\s>
<s> thou who didst waken from his summer dreams the blue mediterranean where he lay 30 lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams beside a pumice isle in baiae's bay and saw in sleep old palaces and towers quivering within the wave's intenser day all overgrown with azure moss and flowers 35 so sweet the sense faints picturing them <\s>
<s> thou for whose path the atlantic's level powers cleave themselves into chasms while far below the sea blooms and the oozy woods which wear the sapless foliage of the ocean know 40 thy voice and suddenly grow gray with fear and tremble and despoil themselves oh hear <\s>

<s> note on poems of 1819 by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley loved the people and respected them as often more virtuous as always more suffering and therefore more deserving of sympathy than the great <\s>
<s> he believed that a clash between the two classes of society was inevitable and he eagerly ranged himself on the people's side <\s>
<s> he had an idea of publishing a series of poems adapted expressly to commemorate their circumstances and wrongs <\s>
<s> he wrote a few but in those days of prosecution for libel they could not be printed <\s>
<s> they are not among the best of his productions a writer being always shackled when he endeavours to write down to the comprehension of those who could not understand or feel a highly imaginative style but they show his earnestness and with what heart felt compassion he went home to the direct point of injury that oppression is detestable as being the parent of starvation nakedness and ignorance <\s>
<s> besides these outpourings of compassion and indignation he had meant to adorn the cause he loved with loftier poetry of glory and triumph such is the scope of the ode to the assertors of liberty <\s>

<s> a sensitive plant in a garden grew and the young winds fed it with silver dew and it opened its fan like leaves to the light <\s>
<s> and closed them beneath the kisses of night <\s>
<s> and the spring arose on the garden fair 5 like the spirit of love felt everywhere and each flower and herb on earth's dark breast rose from the dreams of its wintry rest <\s>
<s> but none ever trembled and panted with bliss in the garden the field or the wilderness 10 like a doe in the noontide with love's sweet want as the companionless sensitive plant <\s>
<s> the snowdrop and then the violet arose from the ground with warm rain wet and their breath was mixed with fresh odour sent 15 from the turf like the voice and the instrument <\s>
<s> then the pied wind flowers and the tulip tall and narcissi the fairest among them all who gaze on their eyes in the stream's recess till they die of their own dear loveliness 20 and the naiad like lily of the vale whom youth makes so fair and passion so pale that the light of its tremulous bells is seen through their pavilions of tender green and the hyacinth purple and white and blue 25 which flung from its bells a sweet peal anew of music so delicate soft and intense it was felt like an odour within the sense and the rose like a nymph to the bath addressed which unveiled the depth of her glowing breast 30 till fold after fold to the fainting air the soul of her beauty and love lay bare and the wand like lily which lifted up as a maenad its moonlight coloured cup till the fiery star which is its eye gazed through clear dew on the tender sky 35 and the jessamine faint and the sweet tuberose the sweetest flower for scent that blows and all rare blossoms from every clime grew in that garden in perfect prime <\s>
<s> 40 and on the stream whose inconstant bosom was pranked under boughs of embowering blossom with golden and green light slanting through their heaven of many a tangled hue broad water lilies lay tremulously 45 and starry river buds glimmered by and around them the soft stream did glide and dance with a motion of sweet sound and radiance <\s>
<s> and the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss which led through the garden along and across 50 some open at once to the sun and the breeze some lost among bowers of blossoming trees were all paved with daisies and delicate bells as fair as the fabulous asphodels and flow'rets which drooping as day drooped too 55 fell into pavilions white purple and blue to roof the glow worm from the evening dew <\s>
<s> and from this undefiled paradise the flowers as an infant's awakening eyes smile on its mother whose singing sweet 60 can first lull and at last must awaken it when heaven's blithe winds had unfolded them as mine lamps enkindle a hidden gem shone smiling to heaven and every one 65 shared joy in the light of the gentle sun for each one was interpenetrated with the light and the odour its neighbour shed like young lovers whom youth and love make dear wrapped and filled by their mutual atmosphere <\s>
<s> but the sensitive plant which could give small fruit 70 of the love which it felt from the leaf to the root received more than all it loved more than ever where none wanted but it could belong to the giver for the sensitive plant has no bright flower radiance and odour are not its dower 75 it loves even like love its deep heart is full it desires what it has not the beautiful <\s>
<s> the light winds which from unsustaining wings shed the music of many murmurings the beams which dart from many a star 80 of the flowers whose hues they bear afar the plumed insects swift and free like golden boats on a sunny sea laden with light and odour which pass over the gleam of the living grass 85 the unseen clouds of the dew which lie like fire in the flowers till the sun rides high then wander like spirits among the spheres each cloud faint with the fragrance it bears the quivering vapours of dim noontide 90 which like a sea o'er the warm earth glide in which every sound and odour and beam move as reeds in a single stream each and all like ministering angels were for the sensitive plant sweet joy to bear 95 whilst the lagging hours of the day went by like windless clouds o'er a tender sky <\s>
<s> and when evening descended from heaven above and the earth was all rest and the air was all love and delight though less bright was far more deep 100 and the day's veil fell from the world of sleep and the beasts and the birds and the insects were drowned in an ocean of dreams without a sound whose waves never mark though they ever impress the light sand which paves it consciousness 105 only overhead the sweet nightingale ever sang more sweet as the day might fail and snatches of its elysian chant were mixed with the dreams of the sensitive plant ); the sensitive plant was the earliest 110 upgathered into the bosom of rest a sweet child weary of its delight the feeblest and yet the favourite cradled within the embrace of night <\s>

<s> a lady the wonder of her kind 5 whose form was upborne by a lovely mind which dilating had moulded her mien and motion like a sea flower unfolded beneath the ocean tended the garden from morn to even and the meteors of that sublunar heaven 10 like the lamps of the air when night walks forth laughed round her footsteps up from the earth <\s>
<s> she had no companion of mortal race but her tremulous breath and her flushing face told whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes 15 that her dreams were less slumber than paradise as if some bright spirit for her sweet sake had deserted heaven while the stars were awake as if yet around her he lingering were though the veil of daylight concealed him from her <\s>
<s> 20 her step seemed to pity the grass it pressed you might hear by the heaving of her breast that the coming and going of the wind brought pleasure there and left passion behind <\s>

<s> i doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet rejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet 30 i doubt not they felt the spirit that came from her glowing fingers through all their frame <\s>
<s> she sprinkled bright water from the stream on those that were faint with the sunny beam and out of the cups of the heavy flowers 35 she emptied the rain of the thunder showers <\s>
<s> she lifted their heads with her tender hands and sustained them with rods and osier bands if the flowers had been her own infants she could never have nursed them more tenderly <\s>
<s> 40 and all killing insects and gnawing worms and things of obscene and unlovely forms she bore in a basket of indian woof into the rough woods far aloof in a basket of grasses and wild flowers full 45 the freshest her gentle hands could pull for the poor banished insects whose intent although they did ill was innocent <\s>

<s> and on the fourth the sensitive plant 5 felt the sound of the funeral chant and the steps of the bearers heavy and slow and the sobs of the mourners deep and low the weary sound and the heavy breath and the silent motions of passing death 10 and the smell cold oppressive and dank sent through the pores of the coffin plank the dark grass and the flowers among the grass were bright with tears as the crowd did pass from their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone 15 and sate in the pines and gave groan for groan <\s>
<s> the garden once fair became cold and foul like the corpse of her who had been its soul which at first was lovely as if in sleep then slowly changed till it grew a heap 20 to make men tremble who never weep <\s>
<s> swift summer into the autumn flowed and frost in the mist of the morning rode though the noonday sun looked clear and bright mocking the spoil of the secret night <\s>
<s> 25 the rose leaves like flakes of crimson snow paved the turf and the moss below <\s>
<s> the lilies were drooping and white and wan like the head and the skin of a dying man <\s>
<s> and indian plants of scent and hue 30 the sweetest that ever were fed on dew leaf by leaf day after day were massed into the common clay <\s>
<s> and the leaves brown yellow and gray and red and white with the whiteness of what is dead 35 like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed their whistling noise made the birds aghast <\s>
<s> and the gusty winds waked the winged seeds out of their birthplace of ugly weeds till they clung round many a sweet flower's stem 40 which rotted into the earth with them <\s>
<s> the water blooms under the rivulet fell from the stalks on which they were set and the eddies drove them here and there as the winds did those of the upper air <\s>
<s> 45 then the rain came down and the broken stalks were bent and tangled across the walks and the leafless network of parasite bowers massed into ruin and all sweet flowers <\s>
<s> between the time of the wind and the snow 50 all loathliest weeds began to grow whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck like the water snake's belly and the toad's back <\s>
<s> and thistles and nettles and darnels rank and the dock and henbane and hemlock dank 55 stretched out its long and hollow shank and stifled the air till the dead wind stank <\s>

<s> and unctuous meteors from spray to spray crept and flitted in broad noonday 75 unseen every branch on which they alit by a venomous blight was burned and bit <\s>
<s> the sensitive plant like one forbid wept and the tears within each lid of its folded leaves which together grew 80 were changed to a blight of frozen glue <\s>
<s> for the leaves soon fell and the branches soon by the heavy axe of the blast were hewn the sap shrank to the root through every pore as blood to a heart that will beat no more <\s>

<s> then the weeds which were forms of living death fled from the frost to the earth beneath <\s>
<s> 95 their decay and sudden flight from frost was but like the vanishing of a ghost <\s>
<s> and under the roots of the sensitive plant the moles and the dormice died for want the birds dropped stiff from the frozen air 100 and were caught in the branches naked and bare <\s>
<s> first there came down a thawing rain and its dull drops froze on the boughs again then there steamed up a freezing dew which to the drops of the thaw rain grew 105 and a northern whirlwind wandering about like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out shook the boughs thus laden and heavy and stiff and snapped them off with his rigid griff <\s>

<s> the rags of the sail are flickering in ribbons within the fierce gale from the stark night of vapours the dim rain is driven and when lightning is loosed like a deluge from heaven she sees the black trunks of the waterspouts spin 5 and bend as if heaven was ruining in which they seemed to sustain with their terrible mass as if ocean had sunk from beneath them they pass to their graves in the deep with an earthquake of sound and the waves and the thunders made silent around 10 leave the wind to its echo <\s>
<s> the vessel now tossed through the low trailing rack of the tempest is lost in the skirts of the thunder cloud now down the sweep of the wind cloven wave to the chasm of the deep it sinks and the walls of the watery vale 15 whose depths of dread calm are unmoved by the gale dim mirrors of ruin hang gleaming about while the surf like a chaos of stars like a rout of death flames like whirlpools of fire flowing iron with splendour and terror the black ship environ 20 or like sulphur flakes hurled from a mine of pale fire in fountains spout o'er it <\s>
<s> in many a spire the pyramid billows with white points of brine in the cope of the lightning inconstantly shine as piercing the sky from the floor of the sea <\s>
<s> 25 the great ship seems splitting <\s>
<s> it cracks as a tree while an earthquake is splintering its root ere the blast of the whirlwind that stripped it of branches has passed <\s>
<s> the intense thunder balls which are raining from heaven have shattered its mast and it stands black and riven <\s>
<s> 30 the chinks suck destruction <\s>
<s> the heavy dead hulk on the living sea rolls an inanimate bulk like a corpse on the clay which is hungering to fold its corruption around it <\s>
<s> meanwhile from the hold one deck is burst up by the waters below 35 and it splits like the ice when the thaw breezes blow o'er the lakes of the desert <\s>
<s> who sit on the other <\s>
<s> is that all the crew that lie burying each other like the dead in a breach round the foremast <\s>
<s> are those twin tigers who burst when the waters arose 40 in the agony of terror their chains in the hold what now makes them tame is what then made them bold ;) who crouch side by side and have driven like a crank the deep grip of their claws through the vibrating plank are these all <\s>
<s> nine weeks the tall vessel had lain 45 on the windless expanse of the watery plain where the death darting sun cast no shadow at noon and there seemed to be fire in the beams of the moon till a lead coloured fog gathered up from the deep whose breath was quick pestilence then the cold sleep 50 crept like blight through the ears of a thick field of corn o'er the populous vessel <\s>
<s> and even and morn with their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast down the deep which closed on them above and around 55 and the sharks and the dogfish their grave clothes unbound and were glutted like jews with this manna rained down from god on their wilderness <\s>
<s> one after one the mariners died on the eve of this day when the tempest was gathering in cloudy array 60 but seven remained <\s>
<s> six the thunder has smitten and they lie black as mummies on which time has written his scorn of the embalmer the seventh from the deck an oak splinter pierced through his breast and his back and hung out to the tempest a wreck on the wreck <\s>
<s> at the helm sits a woman more fair than heaven when unbinding its star braided hair it sinks with the sun on the earth and the sea <\s>
<s> she clasps a bright child on her upgathered knee it laughs at the lightning it mocks the mixed thunder 70 of the air and the sea with desire and with wonder it is beckoning the tigers to rise and come near it would play with those eyes where the radiance of fear is outshining the meteors its bosom beats high the heart fire of pleasure has kindled its eye 75 while its mother's is lustreless <\s>

<s> black as a cormorant the screaming blast 105 between ocean and heaven like an ocean passed till it came to the clouds on the verge of the world which based on the sea and to heaven upcurled like columns and walls did surround and sustain the dome of the tempest it rent them in twain 110 as a flood rends its barriers of mountainous crag and the dense clouds in many a ruin and rag like the stones of a temple ere earthquake has passed like the dust of its fall <\s>
<s> on the whirlwind are cast they are scattered like foam on the torrent and where 115 the wind has burst out through the chasm from the air of clear morning the beams of the sunrise flow in unimpeded keen golden and crystalline banded armies of light and of air at one gate they encounter but interpenetrate <\s>
<s> 120 and that breach in the tempest is widening away and the caverns of cloud are torn up by the day and the fierce winds are sinking with weary wings lulled by the motion and murmurings and the long glassy heave of the rocking sea 125 and overhead glorious but dreadful to see the wrecks of the tempest like vapours of gold are consuming in sunrise <\s>
<s> the heaped waves behold the deep calm of blue heaven dilating above and like passions made still by the presence of love 130 beneath the clear surface reflecting it slide tremulous with soft influence extending its tide from the andes to atlas round mountain and isle round sea birds and wrecks paved with heaven's azure smile the wide world of waters is vibrating <\s>

<s> from yonder pointed hill crowned with a ring of oaks you may behold a dark and barren field through which there flows sluggish and black a deep but narrow stream which the wind ripples not and the fair moon 5 gazes in vain and finds no mirror there <\s>
<s> follow the herbless banks of that strange brook until you pause beside a darksome pond the fountain of this rivulet whose gush cannot be seen hid by a rayless night 10 that lives beneath the overhanging rock that shades the pool an endless spring of gloom upon whose edge hovers the tender light trembling to mingle with its paramour but as syrinx fled pan so night flies day 15 or with most sullen and regardless hate refuses stern her heaven born embrace <\s>
<s> on one side of this jagged and shapeless hill there is a cave from which there eddies up a pale mist like aereal gossamer 20 whose breath destroys all life awhile it veils the rock then scattered by the wind it flies along the stream or lingers on the clefts killing the sleepy worms if aught bide there <\s>
<s> upon the beetling edge of that dark rock 25 there stands a group of cypresses not such as with a graceful spire and stirring life pierce the pure heaven of your native vale whose branches the air plays among but not disturbs fearing to spoil their solemn grace 30 but blasted and all wearily they stand one to another clinging their weak boughs sigh as the wind buffets them and they shake beneath its blasts a weatherbeaten crew <\s>
<s> chorus what wondrous sound is that mournful and faint 35 but more melodious than the murmuring wind which through the columns of a temple glides <\s>
<s> a it is the wandering voice of orpheus lyre borne by the winds who sigh that their rude king hurries them fast from these air feeding notes 40 but in their speed they bear along with them the waning sound scattering it like dew upon the startled sense <\s>
<s> chorus does he still sing <\s>

<s> and then he struck from forth the strings a sound of deep and fearful melody <\s>
<s> 55 in times long past when fair eurydice with her bright eyes sat listening by his side he gently sang of high and heavenly themes <\s>
<s> as in a brook fretted with little waves by the light airs of spring each riplet makes 60 a many sided mirror for the sun while it flows musically through green banks ceaseless and pauseless ever clear and fresh so flowed his song reflecting the deep joy and tender love that fed those sweetest notes 65 the heavenly offspring of ambrosial food <\s>
<s> but that is past <\s>
<s> returning from drear hell he chose a lonely seat of unhewn stone blackened with lichens on a herbless plain <\s>
<s> then from the deep and overflowing spring 70 of his eternal ever moving grief there rose to heaven a sound of angry song <\s>
<s> tis as a mighty cataract that parts two sister rocks with waters swift and strong 75 and casts itself with horrid roar and din adown a steep from a perennial source it ever flows and falls and breaks the air with loud and fierce but most harmonious roar and as it falls casts up a vaporous spray which the sun clothes in hues of iris light <\s>
<s> 80 thus the tempestuous torrent of his grief is clothed in sweetest sounds and varying words of poesy <\s>
<s> unlike all human works it never slackens and through every change wisdom and beauty and the power divine 85 of mighty poesy together dwell mingling in sweet accord <\s>
<s> as i have seen a fierce south blast tear through the darkened sky driving along a rack of winged clouds which may not pause but ever hurry on 90 as their wild shepherd wills them while the stars twinkling and dim peep from between the plumes <\s>
<s> anon the sky is cleared and the high dome of serene heaven starred with fiery flowers shuts in the shaken earth or the still moon 95 swiftly yet gracefully begins her walk rising all bright behind the eastern hills <\s>

<s> when those we love have passed into eternity life is the desert and the solitude in which we are forced to linger but never find comfort more <\s>
<s> there is much in the adonais which seems now more applicable to shelley himself than to the young and gifted poet whom he mourned <\s>
<s> the poetic view he takes of death and the lofty scorn he displays towards his calumniators are as a prophecy on his own destiny when received among immortal names and the poisonous breath of critics has vanished into emptiness before the fame he inherits <\s>
<s> shelley's favourite taste was boating when living near the thames or by the lake of geneva much of his life was spent on the water <\s>
<s> on the shore of every lake or stream or sea near which he dwelt he had a boat moored <\s>
<s> he had latterly enjoyed this pleasure again <\s>
<s> there are no pleasure boats on the arno and the shallowness of its waters except in winter time when the stream is too turbid and impetuous for boating rendered it difficult to get any skiff light enough to float <\s>
<s> shelley however overcame the difficulty he together with a friend contrived a boat such as the huntsmen carry about with them in the maremma to cross the sluggish but deep streams that intersect the forests a boat of laths and pitched canvas <\s>
<s> it held three persons and he was often seen on the arno in it to the horror of the italians who remonstrated on the danger and could not understand how anyone could take pleasure in an exercise that risked life <\s>
<s> ma va per la vita <\s>
<s> i little thought how true their words would prove <\s>
<s> he once ventured with a friend on the glassy sea of a calm day down the arno and round the coast to leghorn which by keeping close in shore was very practicable <\s>
<s> they returned to pisa by the canal when missing the direct cut they got entangled among weeds and the boat upset a wetting was all the harm done except that the intense cold of his drenched clothes made shelley faint <\s>
<s> once i went down with him to the mouth of the arno where the stream then high and swift met the tideless sea and disturbed its sluggish waters <\s>
<s> it was a waste and dreary scene the desert sand stretched into a point surrounded by waves that broke idly though perpetually around it was a scene very similar to lido of which he had said i love all waste and solitary places where we taste the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows <\s>
<s> our little boat was of greater use unaccompanied by any danger when we removed to the baths <\s>
<s> some friends lived at the village of pugnano four miles off and we went to and fro to see them in our boat by the canal which fed by the serchio was though an artificial a full and picturesque stream making its way under verdant banks sheltered by trees that dipped their boughs into the murmuring waters <\s>
<s> by day multitudes of ephemera darted to and fro on the surface at night the fireflies came out among the shrubs on the banks the cicale at noon day kept up their hum the aziola cooed in the quiet evening <\s>
<s> it was a pleasant summer bright in all but shelley's health and inconstant spirits yet he enjoyed himself greatly and became more and more attached to the part of the country were chance appeared to cast us <\s>
<s> sometimes he projected taking a farm situated on the height of one of the near hills surrounded by chestnut and pine woods and overlooking a wide extent of country or settling still farther in the maritime apennines at massa <\s>
<s> several of his slighter and unfinished poems were inspired by these scenes and by the companions around us <\s>
<s> it is the nature of that poetry however which overflows from the soul oftener to express sorrow and regret than joy for it is when oppressed by the weight of life and away from those he loves that the poet has recourse to the solace of expression in verse <\s>
<s> still shelley's passion was the ocean and he wished that our summers instead of being passed among the hills near pisa should be spent on the shores of the sea <\s>
<s> it was very difficult to find a spot <\s>
<s> we shrank from naples from a fear that the heats would disagree with percy leghorn had lost its only attraction since our friends who had resided there were returned to england and monte nero being the resort of many english we did not wish to find ourselves in the midst of a colony of chance travellers <\s>
<s> no one then thought it possible to reside at via reggio which latterly has become a summer resort <\s>
<s> the low lands and bad air of maremma stretch the whole length of the western shores of the mediterranean till broken by the rocks and hills of spezia <\s>
<s> it was a vague idea but shelley suggested an excursion to spezia to see whether it would be feasible to spend a summer there <\s>
<s> the beauty of the bay enchanted him <\s>
<s> we saw no house to suit us but the notion took root and many circumstances enchained as by fatality occurred to urge him to execute it <\s>
<s> he looked forward this autumn with great pleasure to the prospect of a visit from leigh hunt <\s>
<s> when shelley visited lord byron at ravenna the latter had suggested his coming out together with the plan of a periodical work in which they should all join <\s>
<s> shelley saw a prospect of good for the fortunes of his friend and pleasure in his society and instantly exerted himself to have the plan executed <\s>
<s> he did not intend himself joining in the work partly from pride not wishing to have the air of acquiring readers for his poetry by associating it with the compositions of more popular writers and also because he might feel shackled in the free expression of his opinions if any friends were to be compromised <\s>
<s> by those opinions carried even to their outermost extent he wished to live and die as being in his conviction not only true but such as alone would conduce to the moral improvement and happiness of mankind <\s>
<s> the sale of the work might meanwhile either really or supposedly be injured by the free expression of his thoughts and this evil he resolved to avoid <\s>

<s> she left me and i stayed alone thinking over every tone 10 which though silent to the ear the enchanted heart could hear like notes which die when born but still haunt the echoes of the hill and feeling ever oh too much 15 the soft vibration of her touch as if her gentle hand even now lightly trembled on my brow and thus although she absent were memory gave me all of her 20 that even fancy dares to claim her presence had made weak and tame all passions and i lived alone in the time which is our own the past and future were forgot 25 as they had been and would be not <\s>

<s> by spirits of the deep thou'rt cradled on the billow to thy eternal sleep <\s>
<s> thou sleep'st upon the shore beside the knelling surge and sea nymphs evermore shall sadly chant thy dirge <\s>

<s> they raise a wail of sorrow while i forever weep <\s>
<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>
<s> they are not what i intended them to be <\s>
<s> i began with energy and a burning desire to impart to the world in worthy language the sense i have of the virtues and genius of the beloved and the lost my strength has failed under the task <\s>
<s> recurrence to the past full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle has shaken my health <\s>
<s> days of great suffering have followed my attempts to write and these again produced a weakness and languor that spread their sinister influence over these notes <\s>
<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>
<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>
<s> williams records the long wished for fact in his journal cloudy and threatening weather <\s>
<s> maglian called and after dinner and while walking with him on the terrace we discovered a strange sail coming round the point of porto venere which proved at length to be shelley's boat <\s>
<s> she had left genoa on thursday last but had been driven back by the prevailing bad winds <\s>
<s> heslop and two english seamen brought her round and they speak most highly of her performances <\s>
<s> she does indeed excite my surprise and admiration <\s>
<s> shelley and i walked to lerici and made a stretch off the land to try her and i find she fetches whatever she looks at <\s>
<s> in short we have now a perfect plaything for the summer it was thus that short sighted mortals welcomed death he having disguised his grim form in a pleasing mask <\s>
<s> the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became fine and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing <\s>
<s> shelley and williams made longer excursions they sailed several times to massa <\s>
<s> they had engaged one of the seamen who brought her round a boy by name charles vivian and they had not the slightest apprehension of danger <\s>
<s> when the weather was unfavourable they employed themselves with alterations in the rigging and by building a boat of canvas and reeds as light as possible to have on board the other for the convenience of landing in waters too shallow for the larger vessel <\s>
<s> when shelley was on board he had his papers with him and much of the triumph of life was written as he sailed or weltered on that sea which was soon to engulf him <\s>
<s> the heats set in in the middle of june the days became excessively hot <\s>
<s> but the sea breeze cooled the air at noon and extreme heat always put shelley in spirits <\s>
<s> a long drought had preceded the heat and prayers for rain were being put up in the churches and processions of relics for the same effect took place in every town <\s>
<s> at this time we received letters announcing the arrival of leigh hunt at genoa <\s>
<s> shelley was very eager to see him <\s>
<s> i was confined to my room by severe illness and could not move it was agreed that shelley and williams should go to leghorn in the boat <\s>
<s> strange that no fear of danger crossed our minds <\s>
<s> living on the sea shore the ocean became as a plaything as a child may sport with a lighted stick till a spark inflames a forest and spreads destruction over all so did we fearlessly and blindly tamper with danger and make a game of the terrors of the ocean <\s>
<s> our italian neighbours even trusted themselves as far as massa in the skiff and the running down the line of coast to leghorn gave no more notion of peril than a fair weather inland navigation would have done to those who had never seen the sea <\s>
<s> once some months before trelawny had raised a warning voice as to the difference of our calm bay and the open sea beyond but shelley and his friend with their one sailor boy thought themselves a match for the storms of the mediterranean in a boat which they looked upon as equal to all it was put to do <\s>
<s> on the 1st of july they left us <\s>
<s> if ever shadow of future ill darkened the present hour such was over my mind when they went <\s>
<s> during the whole of our stay at lerici an intense presentiment of coming evil brooded over my mind and covered this beautiful place and genial summer with the shadow of coming misery <\s>
<s> i had vainly struggled with these emotions they seemed accounted for by my illness but at this hour of separation they recurred with renewed violence <\s>
<s> i did not anticipate danger for them but a vague expectation of evil shook me to agony and i could scarcely bring myself to let them go <\s>
<s> the day was calm and clear and a fine breeze rising at twelve they weighed for leghorn <\s>
<s> they made the run of about fifty miles in seven hours and a half <\s>
<s> the bolivar was in port and the regulations of the health office not permitting them to go on shore after sunset they borrowed cushions from the larger vessel and slept on board their boat <\s>
<s> they spent a week at pisa and leghorn <\s>
<s> the want of rain was severely felt in the country <\s>
<s> the weather continued sultry and fine <\s>
<s> i have heard that shelley all this time was in brilliant spirits <\s>
<s> not long before talking of presentiment he had said the only one that he ever found infallible was the certain advent of some evil fortune when he felt peculiarly joyous <\s>
<s> yet if ever fate whispered of coming disaster such inaudible but not unfelt prognostics hovered around us <\s>
<s> the beauty of the place seemed unearthly in its excess the distance we were at from all signs of civilization the sea at our feet its murmurs or its roaring for ever in our ears all these things led the mind to brood over strange thoughts and lifting it from everyday life caused it to be familiar with the unreal <\s>
<s> a sort of spell surrounded us and each day as the voyagers did not return we grew restless and disquieted and yet strange to say we were not fearful of the most apparent danger <\s>
<s> the spell snapped it was all over an interval of agonizing doubt of days passed in miserable journeys to gain tidings of hopes that took firmer root even as they were more baseless was changed to the certainty of the death that eclipsed all happiness for the survivors for evermore <\s>
<s> there was something in our fate peculiarly harrowing <\s>
<s> the remains of those we lost were cast on shore but by the quarantine laws of the coast we were not permitted to have possession of them the law with respect to everything cast on land by the sea being that such should be burned to prevent the possibility of any remnant bringing the plague into italy and no representation could alter the law <\s>
<s> at length through the kind and unwearied exertions of mr <\s>
<s> dawkins our charge d'affaires at florence we gained permission to receive the ashes after the bodies were consumed <\s>
<s> nothing could equal the zeal of trelawny in carrying our wishes into effect <\s>
<s> he was indefatigable in his exertions and full of forethought and sagacity in his arrangements <\s>
<s> it was a fearful task he stood before us at last his hands scorched and blistered by the flames of the funeral pyre and by touching the burnt relics as he placed them in the receptacles prepared for the purpose <\s>
<s> and there in compass of that small case was gathered all that remained on earth of him whose genius and virtue were a crown of glory to the world whose love had been the source of happiness peace and good to be buried with him <\s>
<s> the concluding stanzas of the adonais pointed out where the remains ought to be deposited in addition to which our beloved child lay buried in the cemetery at rome <\s>
<s> thither shelley's ashes were conveyed and they rest beneath one of the antique weed grown towers that recur at intervals in the circuit of the massy ancient wall of rome <\s>
<s> he selected the hallowed place himself there is the sepulchre oh not of him but of our joy ... <\s>
<s> and gray walls moulder round on which dull time feeds like slow fire upon a hoary brand and one keen pyramid with wedge sublime pavilioning the dust of him who planned this refuge for his memory doth stand like flame transformed to marble and beneath a field is spread on which a newer band have pitched in heaven's smile their camp of death welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath <\s>
<s> could sorrow for the lost and shuddering anguish at the vacancy left behind be soothed by poetic imaginations there was something in shelley's fate to mitigate pangs which yet alas <\s>
<s> could not be so mitigated for hard reality brings too miserably home to the mourner all that is lost of happiness all of lonely unsolaced struggle that remains <\s>
<s> still though dreams and hues of poetry cannot blunt grief it invests his fate with a sublime fitness which those less nearly allied may regard with complacency <\s>
<s> a year before he had poured into verse all such ideas about death as give it a glory of its own <\s>
<s> he had as it now seems almost anticipated his own destiny and when the mind figures his skiff wrapped from sight by the thunder storm as it was last seen upon the purple sea and then as the cloud of the tempest passed away no sign remained of where it had been captain roberts watched the vessel with his glass from the top of the lighthouse of leghorn on its homeward track <\s>
<s> they were off via reggio at some distance from shore when a storm was driven over the sea <\s>
<s> it enveloped them and several larger vessels in darkness <\s>
<s> when the cloud passed onwards roberts looked again and saw every other vessel sailing on the ocean except their little schooner which had vanished <\s>
<s> from that time he could scarcely doubt the fatal truth yet we fancied that they might have been driven towards elba or corsica and so be saved <\s>
<s> the observation made as to the spot where the boat disappeared caused it to be found through the exertions of trelawny for that effect <\s>
<s> it had gone down in ten fathom water it had not capsized and except such things as had floated from her everything was found on board exactly as it had been placed when they sailed <\s>
<s> the boat itself was uninjured <\s>
<s> roberts possessed himself of her and decked her but she proved not seaworthy and her shattered planks now lie rotting on the shore of one of the ionian islands on which she was wrecked who but will regard as a prophecy the last stanza of the adonais <\s>
<s> the breath whose might i have invoked in song descends on me my spirit's bark is driven far from the shore far from the trembling throng whose sails were never to the tempest given the massy earth and sphered skies are riven <\s>
<s> i am borne darkly fearfully afar whilst burning through the inmost veil of heaven the soul of adonais like a star beacons from the abode where the eternal are <\s>

<s> sing muse the son of maia and of jove the herald child king of arcadia and all its pastoral hills whom in sweet love having been interwoven modest may bore heaven's dread supreme <\s>
<s> an antique grove 5 shadowed the cavern where the lovers lay in the deep night unseen by gods or men and white armed juno slumbered sweetly then <\s>
<s> now when the joy of jove had its fulfilling and heaven's tenth moon chronicled her relief 10 she gave to light a babe all babes excelling a schemer subtle beyond all belief a shepherd of thin dreams a cow stealing a night watching and door waylaying thief who mongst the gods was soon about to thieve 15 and other glorious actions to achieve <\s>
<s> the babe was born at the first peep of day he began playing on the lyre at noon and the same evening did he steal away apollo's herds the fourth day of the moon 20 on which him bore the venerable may from her immortal limbs he leaped full soon nor long could in the sacred cradle keep but out to seek apollo's herds would creep <\s>
<s> out of the lofty cavern wandering 25 he found a tortoise and cried out 'a treasure <\s>
<s> for mercury first made the tortoise sing the beast before the portal at his leisure the flowery herbage was depasturing moving his feet in a deliberate measure 30 over the turf <\s>
<s> jove's profitable son eying him laughed and laughing thus begun 5 <\s>
<s> a useful godsend are you to me now king of the dance companion of the feast lovely in all your nature <\s>
<s> welcome you 35 excellent plaything <\s>
<s> where sweet mountain beast got you that speckled shell <\s>
<s> thus much i know you must come home with me and be my guest you will give joy to me and i will do all that is in my power to honour you <\s>
<s> better to be at home than out of door so come with me and though it has been said that you alive defend from magic power i know you will sing sweetly when you're dead <\s>
<s> thus having spoken the quaint infant bore 45 lifting it from the grass on which it fed and grasping it in his delighted hold his treasured prize into the cavern old <\s>
<s> then scooping with a chisel of gray steel he bored the life and soul out of the beast 50 not swifter a swift thought of woe or weal darts through the tumult of a human breast which thronging cares annoy not swifter wheel the flashes of its torture and unrest out of the dizzy eyes than maia's son 55 all that he did devise hath featly done <\s>
<s> and through the tortoise's hard stony skin at proper distances small holes he made and fastened the cut stems of reeds within and with a piece of leather overlaid 60 the open space and fixed the cubits in fitting the bridge to both and stretched o'er all symphonious cords of sheep gut rhythmical <\s>
<s> when he had wrought the lovely instrument he tried the chords and made division meet 65 preluding with the plectrum and there went up from beneath his hand a tumult sweet of mighty sounds and from his lips he sent a strain of unpremeditated wit joyous and wild and wanton such you may 70 hear among revellers on a holiday <\s>
<s> he sung how jove and may of the bright sandal dallied in love not quite legitimate and his own birth still scoffing at the scandal and naming his own name did celebrate 75 his mother's cave and servant maids he planned all in plastic verse her household stuff and state perennial pot trippet and brazen pan but singing he conceived another plan <\s>
<s> seized with a sudden fancy for fresh meat 80 he in his sacred crib deposited the hollow lyre and from the cavern sweet rushed with great leaps up to the mountain's head revolving in his mind some subtle feat of thievish craft such as a swindler might 85 devise in the lone season of dun night <\s>
<s> the great sun under the ocean's bed has driven steeds and chariot the child meanwhile strode o'er the pierian mountains clothed in shadows where the immortal oxen of the god 90 are pastured in the flowering unmown meadows and safely stalled in a remote abode the archer argicide elate and proud drove fifty from the herd lowing aloud <\s>
<s> he drove them wandering o'er the sandy way 95 but being ever mindful of his craft backward and forward drove he them astray so that the tracks which seemed before were aft his sandals then he threw to the ocean spray and for each foot he wrought a kind of raft 100 of tamarisk and tamarisk like sprigs and bound them in a lump with withy twigs <\s>
<s> and on his feet he tied these sandals light the trail of whose wide leaves might not betray his track and then a self sufficing wight 105 like a man hastening on some distant way he from pieria's mountain bent his flight but an old man perceived the infant pass down green onchestus heaped like beds with grass <\s>
<s> the old man stood dressing his sunny vine 110 halloo <\s>
<s> old fellow with the crooked shoulder <\s>
<s> you grub those stumps <\s>
<s> before they will bear wine methinks even you must grow a little older attend i pray to this advice of mine as you would scape what might appal a bolder 115 seeing see not and hearing hear not and if you have understanding understand <\s>
<s> so saying hermes roused the oxen vast o'er shadowy mountain and resounding dell and flower paven plains great hermes passed 120 till the black night divine which favouring fell around his steps grew gray and morning fast wakened the world to work and from her cell sea strewn the pallantean moon sublime into her watch tower just began to climb <\s>
<s> now to alpheus he had driven all the broad foreheaded oxen of the sun they came unwearied to the lofty stall and to the water troughs which ever run through the fresh fields and when with rushgrass tall 130 lotus and all sweet herbage every one had pastured been the great god made them move towards the stall in a collected drove <\s>
<s> a mighty pile of wood the god then heaped and having soon conceived the mystery 135 of fire from two smooth laurel branches stripped the bark and rubbed them in his palms on high suddenly forth the burning vapour leaped and the divine child saw delightedly mercury first found out for human weal 140 tinder box matches fire irons flint and steel <\s>
<s> and fine dry logs and roots innumerous he gathered in a delve upon the ground and kindled them and instantaneous the strength of the fierce flame was breathed around 145 and whilst the might of glorious vulcan thus wrapped the great pile with glare and roaring sound hermes dragged forth two heifers lowing loud close to the fire such might was in the god <\s>
<s> and on the earth upon their backs he threw 150 the panting beasts and rolled them o'er and o'er and bored their lives out <\s>
<s> without more ado he cut up fat and flesh and down before the fire on spits of wood he placed the two toasting their flesh and ribs and all the gore 155 pursed in the bowels and while this was done he stretched their hides over a craggy stone <\s>
<s> we mortals let an ox grow old and then cut it up after long consideration but joyous minded hermes from the glen 160 drew the fat spoils to the more open station of a flat smooth space and portioned them and when he had by lot assigned to each a ration of the twelve gods his mind became aware of all the joys which in religion are <\s>
<s> for the sweet savour of the roasted meat tempted him though immortal <\s>
<s> natheless he checked his haughty will and did not eat though what it cost him words can scarce express and every wish to put such morsels sweet 170 down his most sacred throat he did repress but soon within the lofty portalled stall he placed the fat and flesh and bones and all <\s>
<s> and every trace of the fresh butchery and cooking the god soon made disappear 175 as if it all had vanished through the sky he burned the hoofs and horns and head and hair the insatiate fire devoured them hungrily and when he saw that everything was clear he quenched the coal and trampled the black dust 180 and in the stream his bloody sandals tossed <\s>
<s> all night he worked in the serene moonshine but when the light of day was spread abroad he sought his natal mountain peaks divine <\s>
<s> on his long wandering neither man nor god 185 had met him since he killed apollo's kine nor house dog had barked at him on his road now he obliquely through the keyhole passed like a thin mist or an autumnal blast <\s>
<s> right through the temple of the spacious cave 190 he went with soft light feet as if his tread fell not on earth no sound their falling gave then to his cradle he crept quick and spread the swaddling clothes about him and the knave lay playing with the covering of the bed 195 with his left hand about his knees the right held his beloved tortoise lyre tight <\s>
<s> there he lay innocent as a new born child as gossips say but though he was a god the goddess his fair mother unbeguiled 200 knew all that he had done being abroad whence come you and from what adventure wild you cunning rogue and where have you abode all the long night clothed in your impudence <\s>
<s> what have you done since you departed hence <\s>
<s> apollo soon will pass within this gate and bind your tender body in a chain inextricably tight and fast as fate unless you can delude the god again even when within his arms ah runagate <\s>
<s> 210 a pretty torment both for gods and men your father made when he made you dear mother replied sly hermes wherefore scold and bother <\s>
<s> as if i were like other babes as old and understood nothing of what is what 215 and cared at all to hear my mother scold <\s>
<s> i in my subtle brain a scheme have got which whilst the sacred stars round heaven are rolled will profit you and me nor shall our lot be as you counsel without gifts or food 220 to spend our lives in this obscure abode <\s>
<s> 29 but we will leave this shadow peopled cave and live among the gods and pass each day in high communion sharing what they have of profuse wealth and unexhausted prey 225 and from the portion which my father gave to phoebus i will snatch my share away which if my father will not natheless i who am the king of robbers can but try <\s>
<s> and if latona's son should find me out 230 i'll countermine him by a deeper plan i'll pierce the pythian temple walls though stout and sack the fane of everything i can caldrons and tripods of great worth no doubt each golden cup and polished brazen pan 235 all the wrought tapestries and garments gay so they together talked meanwhile the day 31 <\s>
<s> aethereal born arose out of the flood of flowing ocean bearing light to men <\s>
<s> apollo passed toward the sacred wood 240 which from the inmost depths of its green glen echoes the voice of neptune and there stood on the same spot in green onchestus then that same old animal the vine dresser who was employed hedging his vineyard there <\s>
<s> latona's glorious son began i pray tell ancient hedger of onchestus green whether a drove of kine has passed this way all heifers with crooked horns <\s>
<s> for they have been stolen from the herd in high pieria 250 where a black bull was fed apart between two woody mountains in a neighbouring glen and four fierce dogs watched there unanimous as men <\s>
<s> and what is strange the author of this theft has stolen the fatted heifers every one 255 but the four dogs and the black bull are left stolen they were last night at set of sun of their soft beds and their sweet food bereft now tell me man born ere the world begun have you seen any one pass with the cows 260 to whom the man of overhanging brows 34 <\s>
<s> my friend it would require no common skill justly to speak of everything i see on various purposes of good or ill many pass by my vineyard and to me 265 tis difficult to know the invisible thoughts which in all those many minds may be thus much alone i certainly can say i tilled these vines till the decline of day 35 <\s>
<s> and then i thought i saw but dare not speak 270 with certainty of such a wondrous thing a child who could not have been born a week those fair horned cattle closely following and in his hand he held a polished stick and as on purpose he walked wavering 275 from one side to the other of the road and with his face opposed the steps he trod <\s>
<s> apollo hearing this passed quickly on no winged omen could have shown more clear that the deceiver was his father's son <\s>
<s> 280 so the god wraps a purple atmosphere around his shoulders and like fire is gone to famous pylos seeking his kine there and found their track and his yet hardly cold and cried 'what wonder do mine eyes behold <\s>
<s> here are the footsteps of the horned herd turned back towards their fields of asphodel but these are not the tracks of beast or bird gray wolf or bear or lion of the dell or maned centaur sand was never stirred 290 by man or woman thus <\s>
<s> who with unwearied feet could e'er impress the sand with such enormous vestiges <\s>
<s> that was most strange but this is stranger still <\s>
<s> thus having said phoebus impetuously 295 sought high cyllene's forest cinctured hill and the deep cavern where dark shadows lie and where the ambrosial nymph with happy will bore the saturnian's love child mercury and a delightful odour from the dew 300 of the hill pastures at his coming flew <\s>
<s> and phoebus stooped under the craggy roof arched over the dark cavern maia's child perceived that he came angry far aloof about the cows of which he had been beguiled 305 and over him the fine and fragrant woof of his ambrosial swaddling clothes he piled as among fire brands lies a burning spark covered beneath the ashes cold and dark <\s>
<s> there like an infant who had sucked his fill 310 and now was newly washed and put to bed awake but courting sleep with weary will and gathered in a lump hands feet and head he lay and his beloved tortoise still he grasped and held under his shoulder blade <\s>
<s> 315 phoebus the lovely mountain goddess knew not less her subtle swindling baby who 41 <\s>
<s> lay swathed in his sly wiles <\s>
<s> round every crook of the ample cavern for his kine apollo looked sharp and when he saw them not he took 320 the glittering key and opened three great hollow recesses in the rock where many a nook was filled with the sweet food immortals swallow and mighty heaps of silver and of gold were piled within a wonder to behold <\s>
<s> and white and silver robes all overwrought with cunning workmanship of tracery sweet except among the gods there can be nought in the wide world to be compared with it <\s>
<s> latona's offspring after having sought 330 his herds in every corner thus did greet great hermes little cradled rogue declare of my illustrious heifers where they are <\s>
<s> or a quarrel between us must rise and the event will be that i 335 shall hurl you into dismal tartarus in fiery gloom to dwell eternally nor shall your father nor your mother loose the bars of that black dungeon utterly you shall be cast out from the light of day 340 to rule the ghosts of men unblessed as they <\s>
<s> to whom thus hermes slily answered son of great latona what a speech is this <\s>
<s> why come you here to ask me what is done with the wild oxen which it seems you miss <\s>
<s> 345 i have not seen them nor from any one have heard a word of the whole business if you should promise an immense reward i could not tell more than you now have heard <\s>
<s> an ox stealer should be both tall and strong 350 and i am but a little new born thing who yet at least can think of nothing wrong my business is to suck and sleep and fling the cradle clothes about me all day long or half asleep hear my sweet mother sing 355 and to be washed in water clean and warm and hushed and kissed and kept secure from harm <\s>
<s> o let not e'er this quarrel be averred <\s>
<s> the astounded gods would laugh at you if e'er you should allege a story so absurd 360 as that a new born infant forth could fare out of his home after a savage herd <\s>
<s> i was born yesterday my small feet are too tender for the roads so hard and rough and if you think that this is not enough 365 47 <\s>
<s> i swear a great oath by my father's head that i stole not your cows and that i know of no one else who might or could or did whatever things cows are i do not know for i have only heard the name this said 370 he winked as fast as could be and his brow was wrinkled and a whistle loud gave he like one who hears some strange absurdity <\s>
<s> apollo gently smiled and said ay ay you cunning little rascal you will bore 375 many a rich man's house and your array of thieves will lay their siege before his door silent as night in night and many a day in the wild glens rough shepherds will deplore that you or yours having an appetite 380 met with their cattle comrade of the night <\s>
<s> and this among the gods shall be your gift to be considered as the lord of those who swindle house break sheep steal and shop lift but now if you would not your last sleep doze 385 crawl out thus saying phoebus did uplift the subtle infant in his swaddling clothes and in his arms according to his wont a scheme devised the illustrious argiphont <\s>
<s> and sneezed and shuddered phoebus on the grass 390 him threw and whilst all that he had designed he did perform eager although to pass apollo darted from his mighty mind towards the subtle babe the following scoff do not imagine this will get you off 395 51 <\s>
<s> you little swaddled child of jove and may <\s>
<s> and seized him by this omen i shall trace my noble herds and you shall lead the way cyllenian hermes from the grassy place like one in earnest haste to get away 400 rose and with hands lifted towards his face round both his ears up from his shoulders drew his swaddling clothes and 'what mean you to do 52 <\s>
<s> with me you unkind god said mercury is it about these cows you tease me so <\s>
<s> 405 i wish the race of cows were perished i stole not your cows i do not even know what things cows are <\s>
<s> i well may sigh that since i came into this world of woe i should have ever heard the name of one 410 but i appeal to the saturnian's throne <\s>
<s> thus phoebus and the vagrant mercury talked without coming to an explanation with adverse purpose <\s>
<s> as for phoebus he sought not revenge but only information 415 and hermes tried with lies and roguery to cheat apollo but when no evasion served for the cunning one his match had found he paced on first over the sandy ground <\s>
<s> he of the silver bow the child of jove 420 followed behind till to their heavenly sire came both his children beautiful as love and from his equal balance did require a judgement in the cause wherein they strove <\s>
<s> o'er odorous olympus and its snows 425 a murmuring tumult as they came arose 55 <\s>
<s> and from the folded depths of the great hill while hermes and apollo reverent stood before jove's throne the indestructible immortals rushed in mighty multitude 430 and whilst their seats in order due they fill the lofty thunderer in a careless mood to phoebus said whence drive you this sweet prey this herald baby born but yesterday 56 <\s>
<s> a most important subject trifler this 435 to lay before the gods nay father nay when you have understood the business say not that i alone am fond of prey <\s>
<s> i found this little boy in a recess under cyllene's mountains far away 440 a manifest and most apparent thief a scandalmonger beyond all belief <\s>
<s> i never saw his like either in heaven or upon earth for knavery or craft out of the field my cattle yester even 445 by the low shore on which the loud sea laughed he right down to the river ford had driven and mere astonishment would make you daft to see the double kind of footsteps strange he has impressed wherever he did range <\s>
<s> the cattle's track on the black dust full well is evident as if they went towards the place from which they came that asphodel meadow in which i feed my many herds his steps were most incomprehensible 455 i know not how i can describe in words those tracks he could have gone along the sands neither upon his feet nor on his hands 59 <\s>
<s> he must have had some other stranger mode of moving on those vestiges immense 460 far as i traced them on the sandy road seemed like the trail of oak toppings but thence no mark nor track denoting where they trod the hard ground gave but working at his fence a mortal hedger saw him as he passed 465 to pylos with the cows in fiery haste <\s>
<s> i found that in the dark he quietly had sacrificed some cows and before light had thrown the ashes all dispersedly about the road then still as gloomy night 470 had crept into his cradle either eye rubbing and cogitating some new sleight <\s>
<s> no eagle could have seen him as he lay hid in his cavern from the peering day <\s>
<s> i taxed him with the fact when he averred 475 most solemnly that he did neither see nor even had in any manner heard of my lost cows whatever things cows be nor could he tell though offered a reward not even who could tell of them to me <\s>
<s> 480 so speaking phoebus sate and hermes then addressed the supreme lord of gods and men 62 <\s>
<s> great father you know clearly beforehand that all which i shall say to you is sooth i am a most veracious person and 485 totally unacquainted with untruth <\s>

<s> why is the old statesman more skilful than the raw politician because relying on the necessary conjunction of motive and action he proceeds to produce moral effects by the application of those moral causes which experience has shown to be effectual <\s>
<s> some actions may be found to which we can attach no motives but these are the effects of causes with which we are unacquainted <\s>
<s> hence the relation which motive bears to voluntary action is that of cause to effect nor placed in this point of view is it or ever has it been the subject of popular or philosophical dispute <\s>
<s> none but the few fanatics who are engaged in the herculean task of reconciling the justice of their god with the misery of man will longer outrage common sense by the supposition of an event without a cause a voluntary action without a motive <\s>
<s> history politics morals criticism all grounds of reasonings all principles of science alike assume the truth of the doctrine of necessity <\s>
<s> no farmer carrying his corn to market doubts the sale of it at the market price <\s>
<s> the master of a manufactory no more doubts that he can purchase the human labour necessary for his purposes than that his machinery will act as they have been accustomed to act <\s>
<s> but whilst none have scrupled to admit necessity as influencing matter many have disputed its dominion over mind <\s>
<s> independently of its militating with the received ideas of the justice of god it is by no means obvious to a superficial inquiry <\s>
<s> when the mind observes its own operations it feels no connection of motive and action but as we know nothing more of causation than the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other as we find that these two circumstances are universally allowed to have place in voluntary action we may be easily led to own that they are subjected to the necessity common to all causes <\s>
<s> the actions of the will have a regular conjunction with circumstances and characters motive is to voluntary action what cause is to effect <\s>
<s> but the only idea we can form of causation is a constant conjunction of similar objects and the consequent inference of one from the other wherever this is the case necessity is clearly established <\s>
<s> the idea of liberty applied metaphorically to the will has sprung from a misconception of the meaning of the word power <\s>
<s> what is power id quod potest that which can produce any given effect <\s>
<s> to deny power is to say that nothing can or has the power to be or act <\s>
<s> in the only true sense of the word power it applies with equal force to the lodestone as to the human will <\s>
<s> do you think these motives which i shall present are powerful enough to rouse him <\s>
<s> is a question just as common as do you think this lever has the power of raising this weight <\s>
<s> the advocates of free will assert that the will has the power of refusing to be determined by the strongest motive but the strongest motive is that which overcoming all others ultimately prevails this assertion therefore amounts to a denial of the will being ultimately determined by that motive which does determine it which is absurd <\s>
<s> but it is equally certain that a man cannot resist the strongest motive as that he cannot overcome a physical impossibility <\s>
<s> the doctrine of necessity tends to introduce a great change into the established notions of morality and utterly to destroy religion <\s>
<s> reward and punishment must be considered by the necessarian merely as motives which he would employ in order to procure the adoption or abandonment of any given line of conduct <\s>
<s> desert in the present sense of the word would no longer have any meaning and he who should inflict pain upon another for no better reason than that he deserved it would only gratify his revenge under pretence of satisfying justice <\s>
<s> it is not enough says the advocate of free will that a criminal should be prevented from a repetition of his crime he should feel pain and his torments when justly inflicted ought precisely to be proportioned to his fault <\s>
<s> but utility is morality that which is incapable of producing happiness is useless and though the crime of damiens must be condemned yet the frightful torments which revenge under the name of justice inflicted on this unhappy man cannot be supposed to have augmented even at the long run the stock of pleasurable sensation in the world <\s>
<s> at the same time the doctrine of necessity does not in the least diminish our disapprobation of vice <\s>
<s> the conviction which all feel that a viper is a poisonous animal and that a tiger is constrained by the inevitable condition of his existence to devour men does not induce us to avoid them lass sedulously or even more to hesitate in destroying them but he would surely be of a hard heart who meeting with a serpent on a desert island or in a situation where it was incapable of injury should wantonly deprive it of existence <\s>
<s> a necessarian is inconsequent to his own principles if he indulges in hatred or contempt the compassion which he feels for the criminal is unmixed with a desire of injuring him he looks with an elevated and dreadless composure upon the links of the universal chain as they pass before his eyes whilst cowardice curiosity and inconsistency only assail him in proportion to the feebleness and indistinctness with which he has perceived and rejected the delusions of free will <\s>
<s> religion is the perception of the relation in which we stand to the principle of the universe <\s>
<s> but if the principle of the universe be not an organic being the model and prototype of man the relation between it and human beings is absolutely none <\s>
<s> without some insight into its will respecting our actions religion is nugatory and vain <\s>
<s> but will is only a mode of animal mind moral qualities also are such as only a human being can possess to attribute them to the principle of the universe is to annex to it properties incompatible with any possible definition of its nature <\s>
<s> it is probable that the word god was originally only an expression denoting the unknown cause of the known events which men perceived in the universe <\s>
<s> by the vulgar mistake of a metaphor for a real being of a word for a thing it became a man endowed with human qualities and governing the universe as an earthly monarch governs his kingdom <\s>
<s> their addresses to this imaginary being indeed are much in the same style as those of subjects to a king <\s>
<s> they acknowledge his benevolence deprecate his anger and supplicate his favour <\s>
<s> but the doctrine of necessity teaches us that in no case could any event have happened otherwise than it did happen and that if god is the author of good he is also the author of evil that if he is entitled to our gratitude for the one he is entitled to our hatred for the other that admitting the existence of this hypothetic being he is also subjected to the dominion of an immutable necessity <\s>
<s> it is plain that the same arguments which prove that god is the author of food light and life prove him also to be the author of poison darkness and death <\s>
<s> the wide wasting earthquake the storm the battle and the tyranny are attributable to this hypothetic being in the same degree as the fairest forms of nature sunshine liberty and peace <\s>
<s> but we are taught by the doctrine of necessity that there is neither good nor evil in the universe otherwise than as the events to which we apply these epithets have relation to our own peculiar mode of being <\s>
<s> still less than with the hypothesis of a god will the doctrine of necessity accord with the belief of a future state of punishment <\s>
<s> god made man such as he is and than damned him for being so for to say that god was the author of all good and man the author of all evil is to say that one man made a straight line and a crooked one and another man made the incongruity <\s>

<s> the hypothesis of a pervading spirit co eternal with the universe remains unshaken <\s>
<s> a close examination of the validity of the proofs adduced to support any proposition is the only secure way of attaining truth on the advantages of which it is unnecessary to descant our knowledge of the existence of a deity is a subject of such importance that it cannot be too minutely investigated in consequence of this conviction we proceed briefly and impartially to examine the proofs which have been adduced <\s>
<s> it is necessary first to consider the nature of belief <\s>
<s> when a proposition is offered to the mind it perceives the agreement or disagreement of the ideas of which it is composed <\s>
<s> a perception of their agreement is termed belief <\s>
<s> many obstacles frequently prevent this perception from being immediate these the mind attempts to remove in order that the perception may be distinct <\s>
<s> the mind is active in the investigation in order to perfect the state of perception of the relation which the component ideas of the proposition bear to each which is passive the investigation being confused with the perception has induced many falsely to imagine that the mind is active in belief that belief is an act of volition in consequence of which it may be regulated by the mind <\s>
<s> pursuing continuing this mistake they have attached a degree of criminality to disbelief of which in its nature it is incapable it is equally incapable of merit <\s>
<s> belief then is a passion the strength of which like every other passion is in precise proportion to the degrees of excitement <\s>
<s> the degrees of excitement are three <\s>
<s> the senses are the sources of all knowledge to the mind consequently their evidence claims the strongest assent <\s>
<s> the decision of the mind founded upon our own experience derived from these sources claims the next degree <\s>
<s> the experience of others which addresses itself to the former one occupies the lowest degree <\s>
<s> a graduated scale on which should be marked the capabilities of propositions to approach to the test of the senses would be a just barometer of the belief which ought to be attached to them consequently no testimony can be admitted which is contrary to reason reason is founded on the evidence of our senses <\s>
<s> every proof may be referred to one of these three divisions it is to be considered what arguments we receive from each of them which should convince us of the existence of a deity <\s>
<s> 1st the evidence of the senses <\s>
<s> if the deity should appear to us if he should convince our senses of his existence this revelation would necessarily command belief <\s>
<s> those to whom the deity has thus appeared have the strongest possible conviction of his existence <\s>
<s> but the god of theologians is incapable of local visibility <\s>
<s> it is urged that man knows that whatever is must either have had a beginning or have existed from all eternity he also knows that whatever is not eternal must have had a cause <\s>
<s> when this reasoning is applied to the universe it is necessary to prove that it was created until that is clearly demonstrated we may reasonably suppose that it has endured from all eternity <\s>
<s> we must prove design before we can infer a designer <\s>
<s> the only idea which we can form of causation is derivable from the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other <\s>
<s> in a case where two propositions are diametrically opposite the mind believes that which is least incomprehensible it is easier to suppose that the universe has existed from all eternity than to conceive a being beyond its limits capable of creating it if the mind sinks beneath the weight of one is it an alleviation to increase the intolerability of the burthen <\s>
<s> the other argument which is founded on a man's knowledge of his own existence stands thus <\s>
<s> a man knows not only that he now is but that once he was not consequently there must have been a cause <\s>
<s> but our idea of causation is alone derivable from the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other and reasoning experimentally we can only infer from effects causes exactly adequate to those effects <\s>
<s> but there certainly is a generative power which is effected by certain instruments we cannot prove that it is inherent in these instruments nor is the contrary hypothesis capable of demonstration we admit that the generative power is incomprehensible but to suppose that the same effect is produced by an eternal omniscient omnipotent being leaves the cause in the same obscurity but renders it more incomprehensible <\s>
<s> it is required that testimony should not be contrary to reason <\s>
<s> the testimony that the deity convinces the senses of men of his existence can only be admitted by us if our mind considers it less probable that these men should have been deceived than that the deity should have appeared to them <\s>
<s> our reason can never admit the testimony of men who not only declare that they were eye witnesses of miracles but that the deity was irrational for he commanded that he should be believed he proposed the highest rewards for faith eternal punishments for disbelief <\s>
<s> we can only command voluntary actions belief is not an act of volition the mind is even passive or involuntarily active from this it is evident that we have no sufficient testimony or rather that testimony is insufficient to prove the being of a god <\s>
<s> it has been before shown that it cannot be deduced from reason <\s>
<s> they alone then who have been convinced by the evidence of the senses can believe it <\s>
<s> hence it is evident that having no proofs from either of the three sources of conviction the mind cannot believe the existence of a creative god it is also evident that as belief is a passion of the mind no degree of criminality is attachable to disbelief and that they only are reprehensible who neglect to remove the false medium through which their mind views any subject of discussion <\s>
<s> every reflecting mind must acknowledge that there is no proof of the existence of a deity <\s>
<s> god is an hypothesis and as such stands in need of proof the onus probandi rests on the theist <\s>
<s> sir isaac newton says hypotheses non fingo quicquid enim ex phaenomenis non deducitur hypothesis vocanda est et hypothesis vel metaphysicae vel physicae vel qualitatum occultarum seu mechanicae in philosophia locum non habent <\s>
<s> to all proofs of the existence of a creative god apply this valuable rule <\s>
<s> we see a variety of bodies possessing a variety of powers we merely know their effects we are in a state of ignorance with respect to their essences and causes <\s>
<s> these newton calls the phenomena of things but the pride of philosophy is unwilling to admit its ignorance of their causes <\s>
<s> from the phenomena which are the objects of our senses we attempt to infer a cause which we call god and gratuitously endow it with all negative and contradictory qualities <\s>
<s> from this hypothesis we invent this general name to conceal our ignorance of causes and essences <\s>
<s> the being called god by no means answers with the conditions prescribed by newton it bears every mark of a veil woven by philosophical conceit to hide the ignorance of philosophers even from themselves <\s>
<s> they borrow the threads of its texture from the anthropomorphism of the vulgar <\s>
<s> words have been used by sophists for the same purposes from the occult qualities of the peripatetics to the effluvium of boyle and the crinities or nebulae of herschel <\s>
<s> god is represented as infinite eternal incomprehensible he is contained under every predicate in non that the logic of ignorance could fabricate <\s>
<s> even his worshippers allow that it is impossible to form any idea of him they exclaim with the french poet pour dire ce qu'il est il faut etre lui meme <\s>
<s> lord bacon says that atheism leaves to man reason philosophy natural piety laws reputation and everything that can serve to conduct him to virtue but superstition destroys all these and erects itself into a tyranny over the understandings of men hence atheism never disturbs the government but renders man more clear sighted since he seas nothing beyond the boundaries of the present life bacon's moral essays <\s>

<s> an author of strong common sense has observed that a miracle is no miracle at second hand he might have added that a miracle is no miracle in any case for until we are acquainted with all natural causes we have no reason to imagine others <\s>
<s> there remains to be considered another proof of christianity prophecy <\s>
<s> a book is written before a certain event in which this event is foretold how could the prophet have foreknown it without inspiration <\s>
<s> how could he have been inspired without god <\s>
<s> the greatest stress is laid on the prophecies of moses and hosea on the dispersion of the jews and that of isaiah concerning the coming of the messiah <\s>
<s> the prophecy of moses is a collection of every possible cursing and blessing and it is so far from being marvellous that the one of dispersion should have been fulfilled that it would have been more surprising if out of all these none should have taken effect <\s>
<s> in deuteronomy chapter 28 verse 64 where moses explicitly foretells the dispersion he states that they shall there serve gods of wood and stone and the lord shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even to the other and there thou shalt serve other gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even gods of wood and stone <\s>
<s> the jews are at this day remarkably tenacious of their religion <\s>
<s> moses also declares that they shall be subjected to these curses for disobedience to his ritual and it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all the commandments and statutes which i command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee <\s>
<s> is this the real reason <\s>
<s> the third fourth and fifth chapters of hosea are a piece of immodest confession <\s>
<s> the indelicate type might apply in a hundred senses to a hundred things <\s>
<s> the fifty third chapter of isaiah is more explicit yet it does not exceed in clearness the oracles of delphos <\s>
<s> the historical proof that moses isaiah and hosea did write when they are said to have written is far from being clear and circumstantial <\s>
<s> but prophecy requires proof in its character as a miracle we have no right to suppose that a man foreknew future events from god until it is demonstrated that he neither could know them by his own exertions nor that the writings which contain the prediction could possibly have been fabricated after the event pretended to be foretold <\s>
<s> it is more probable that writings pretending to divine inspiration should have been fabricated after the fulfilment of their pretended prediction than that they should have really been divinely inspired when we consider that the latter supposition makes god at once the creator of the human mind and ignorant of its primary powers particularly as we have numberless instances of false religions and forged prophecies of things long past and no accredited case of god having conversed with men directly or indirectly <\s>
<s> it is also possible that the description of an event might have foregone its occurrence but this is far from being a legitimate proof of a divine revelation as many men not pretending to the character of a prophet have nevertheless in this sense prophesied <\s>
<s> lord chesterfield was never yet taken for a prophet even by a bishop yet he uttered this remarkable prediction the despotic government of france is screwed up to the highest pitch a revolution is fast approaching that revolution i am convinced will be radical and sanguinary <\s>
<s> this appeared in the letters of the prophet long before the accomplishment of this wonderful prediction <\s>
<s> now have these particulars come to pass or have they not <\s>
<s> if they have how could the earl have foreknown them without inspiration <\s>
<s> if we admit the truth of the christian religion on testimony such as this we must admit on the same strength of evidence that god has affixed the highest rewards to belief and the eternal tortures of the never dying worm to disbelief both of which have been demonstrated to be involuntary <\s>
<s> the last proof of the christian religion depends on the influence of the holy ghost <\s>
<s> theologians divide the influence of the holy ghost into its ordinary and extraordinary modes of operation <\s>
<s> the latter is supposed to be that which inspired the prophets and apostles and the former to be the grace of god which summarily makes known the truth of his revelation to those whose mind is fitted for its reception by a submissive perusal of his word <\s>
<s> persons convinced in this manner can do anything but account for their conviction describe the time at which it happened or the manner in which it came upon them <\s>
<s> it is supposed to enter the mind by other channels than those of the senses and therefore professes to be superior to reason founded on their experience <\s>
<s> admitting however the usefulness or possibility of a divine revelation unless we demolish the foundations of all human knowledge it is requisite that our reason should previously demonstrate its genuineness for before we extinguish the steady ray of reason and common sense it is fit that we should discover whether we cannot do without their assistance whether or no there be any other which may suffice to guide us through the labyrinth of life see locke's essay on the human understanding book 4 chapter 19 on enthusiasm ): for if a man is to be inspired upon all occasions if he is to be sure of a thing because he is sure if the ordinary operations of the spirit are not to be considered very extraordinary modes of demonstration if enthusiasm is to usurp the place of proof and madness that of sanity all reasoning is superfluous <\s>
<s> the mahometan dies fighting for his prophet the indian immolates himself at the chariot wheels of brahma the hottentot worships an insect the negro a bunch of feathers the mexican sacrifices human victims <\s>
<s> their degree of conviction must certainly be very strong it cannot arise from reasoning it must from feelings the reward of their prayers <\s>
<s> if each of these should affirm in opposition to the strongest possible arguments that inspiration carried internal evidence i fear their inspired brethren the orthodox missionaries would be so uncharitable as to pronounce them obstinate <\s>
<s> miracles cannot be received as testimonies of a disputed fact because all human testimony has ever been insufficient to establish the possibility of miracles <\s>
<s> that which is incapable of proof itself is no proof of anything else <\s>
<s> prophecy has also been rejected by the test of reason <\s>

<s> note on queen mab by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley was eighteen when he wrote queen mab he never published it <\s>
<s> when it was written he had come to the decision that he was too young to be a judge of controversies and he was desirous of acquiring that sobriety of spirit which is the characteristic of true heroism <\s>
<s> but he never doubted the truth or utility of his opinions and in printing and privately distributing queen mab he believed that he should further their dissemination without occasioning the mischief either to others or himself that might arise from publication <\s>
<s> it is doubtful whether he would himself have admitted it into a collection of his works <\s>
<s> his severe classical taste refined by the constant study of the greek poets might have discovered defects that escape the ordinary reader and the change his opinions underwent in many points would have prevented him from putting forth the speculations of his boyish days <\s>
<s> but the poem is too beautiful in itself and far too remarkable as the production of a boy of eighteen to allow of its being passed over besides that having been frequently reprinted the omission would be vain <\s>
<s> in the former edition certain portions were left out as shocking the general reader from the violence of their attack on religion <\s>
<s> i myself had a painful feeling that such erasures might be looked upon as a mark of disrespect towards the author and am glad to have the opportunity of restoring them <\s>
<s> the notes also are reprinted entire not because they are models of reasoning or lessons of truth but because shelley wrote them and that all that a man at once so distinguished and so excellent ever did deserves to be preserved <\s>
<s> the alterations his opinions underwent ought to be recorded for they form his history <\s>
<s> a series of articles was published in the new monthly magazine during the autumn of the year 1832 written by a man of great talent a fellow collegian and warm friend of shelley they describe admirably the state of his mind during his collegiate life <\s>
<s> inspired with ardour for the acquisition of knowledge endowed with the keenest sensibility and with the fortitude of a martyr shelley came among his fellow creatures congregated for the purposes of education like a spirit from another sphere too delicately organized for the rough treatment man uses towards man especially in the season of youth and too resolute in carrying out his own sense of good and justice not to become a victim <\s>
<s> to a devoted attachment to those he loved he added a determined resistance to oppression <\s>
<s> refusing to fag at eton he was treated with revolting cruelty by masters and boys this roused instead of taming his spirit and he rejected the duty of obedience when it was enforced by menaces and punishment <\s>
<s> to aversion to the society of his fellow creatures such as he found them when collected together in societies where one egged on the other to acts of tyranny was joined the deepest sympathy and compassion while the attachment he felt for individuals and the admiration with which he regarded their powers and their virtues led him to entertain a high opinion of the perfectibility of human nature and he believed that all could reach the highest grade of moral improvement did not the customs and prejudices of society foster evil passions and excuse evil actions <\s>
<s> the oppression which trembling at every nerve yet resolute to heroism it was his ill fortune to encounter at school and at college led him to dissent in all things from those whose arguments were blows whose faith appeared to engender blame and hatred <\s>
<s> during my existence he wrote to a friend in 1812 i have incessantly speculated thought and read <\s>
<s> his readings were not always well chosen among them were the works of the french philosophers as far as metaphysical argument went he temporarily became a convert <\s>
<s> at the same time it was the cardinal article of his faith that if men were but taught and induced to treat their fellows with love charity and equal rights this earth would realize paradise <\s>
<s> he looked upon religion as it is professed and above all practised as hostile instead of friendly to the cultivation of those virtues which would make men brothers <\s>
<s> can this be wondered at <\s>
<s> at the age of seventeen fragile in health and frame of the purest habits in morals full of devoted generosity and universal kindness glowing with ardour to attain wisdom resolved at every personal sacrifice to do right burning with a desire for affection and sympathy he was treated as a reprobate cast forth as a criminal <\s>
<s> the cause was that he was sincere that he believed the opinions which he entertained to be true <\s>
<s> and he loved truth with a martyr's love he was ready to sacrifice station and fortune and his dearest affections at its shrine <\s>
<s> the sacrifice was demanded from and made by a youth of seventeen <\s>
<s> it is a singular fact in the history of society in the civilized nations of modern times that no false step is so irretrievable as one made in early youth <\s>
<s> older men it is true when they oppose their fellows and transgress ordinary rules carry a certain prudence or hypocrisy as a shield along with them <\s>
<s> but youth is rash nor can it imagine while asserting what it believes to be true and doing what it believes to be right that it should be denounced as vicious and pursued as a criminal <\s>
<s> shelley possessed a quality of mind which experience has shown me to be of the rarest occurrence among human beings this was his unworldliness <\s>
<s> the usual motives that rule men prospects of present or future advantage the rank and fortune of those around the taunts and censures or the praise of those who were hostile to him had no influence whatever over his actions and apparently none over his thoughts <\s>
<s> it is difficult even to express the simplicity and directness of purpose that adorned him <\s>
<s> some few might be found in the history of mankind and some one at least among his own friends equally disinterested and scornful even to severe personal sacrifices of every baser motive <\s>
<s> but no one i believe ever joined this noble but passive virtue to equal active endeavours for the benefit of his friends and mankind in general and to equal power to produce the advantages he desired <\s>
<s> the world's brightest gauds and its most solid advantages were of no worth in his eyes when compared to the cause of what he considered truth and the good of his fellow creatures <\s>
<s> born in a position which to his inexperienced mind afforded the greatest facilities to practise the tenets he espoused he boldly declared the use he would make of fortune and station and enjoyed the belief that he should materially benefit his fellow creatures by his actions while conscious of surpassing powers of reason and imagination it is not strange that he should even while so young have believed that his written thoughts would tend to disseminate opinions which he believed conducive to the happiness of the human race <\s>
<s> if man were a creature devoid of passion he might have said and done all this with quietness <\s>
<s> but he was too enthusiastic and too full of hatred of all the ills he witnessed not to scorn danger <\s>
<s> various disappointments tortured but could not tame his soul <\s>
<s> the more enmity he met the more earnestly he became attached to his peculiar views and hostile to those of the men who persecuted him <\s>
<s> he was animated to greater zeal by compassion for his fellow creatures <\s>
<s> his sympathy was excited by the misery with which the world is burning <\s>
<s> he witnessed the sufferings of the poor and was aware of the evils of ignorance <\s>
<s> he desired to induce every rich man to despoil himself of superfluity and to create a brotherhood of property and service and was ready to be the first to lay down the advantages of his birth <\s>
<s> he was of too uncompromising a disposition to join any party <\s>
<s> he did not in his youth look forward to gradual improvement nay in those days of intolerance now almost forgotten it seemed as easy to look forward to the sort of millennium of freedom and brotherhood which he thought the proper state of mankind as to the present reign of moderation and improvement <\s>
<s> ill health made him believe that his race would soon be run that a year or two was all he had of life <\s>
<s> he desired that these years should be useful and illustrious <\s>
<s> he saw in a fervent call on his fellow creatures to share alike the blessings of the creation to love and serve each other the noblest work that life and time permitted him <\s>
<s> in this spirit he composed queen mab <\s>
<s> he was a lover of the wonderful and wild in literature but had not fostered these tastes at their genuine sources the romances and chivalry of the middle ages but in the perusal of such german works as were current in those days <\s>
<s> under the influence of these he at the age of fifteen wrote two short prose romances of slender merit <\s>
<s> the sentiments and language were exaggerated the composition imitative and poor <\s>
<s> he wrote also a poem on the subject of ahasuerus being led to it by a german fragment he picked up dirty and torn in lincoln's inn fields <\s>
<s> this fell afterwards into other hands and was considerably altered before it was printed <\s>
<s> our earlier english poetry was almost unknown to him <\s>
<s> the love and knowledge of nature developed by wordsworth the lofty melody and mysterious beauty of coleridge's poetry and the wild fantastic machinery and gorgeous scenery adopted by southey composed his favourite reading the rhythm of queen mab was founded on that of thalaba and the first few lines bear a striking resemblance in spirit though not in idea to the opening of that poem <\s>
<s> his fertile imagination and ear tuned to the finest sense of harmony preserved him from imitation <\s>
<s> another of his favourite books was the poem of gebir by walter savage landor <\s>
<s> from his boyhood he had a wonderful facility of versification which he carried into another language and his latin school verses were composed with an ease and correctness that procured for him prizes and caused him to be resorted to by all his friends for help <\s>
<s> he was at the period of writing queen mab a great traveller within the limits of england scotland and ireland <\s>
<s> his time was spent among the loveliest scenes of these countries <\s>
<s> mountain and lake and forest were his home the phenomena of nature were his favourite study <\s>
<s> he loved to inquire into their causes and was addicted to pursuits of natural philosophy and chemistry as far as they could be carried on as an amusement <\s>
<s> these tastes gave truth and vivacity to his descriptions and warmed his soul with that deep admiration for the wonders of nature which constant association with her inspired <\s>
<s> he never intended to publish queen mab as it stands but a few years after when printing alastor he extracted a small portion which he entitled the daemon of the world <\s>
<s> in this he changed somewhat the versification and made other alterations scarcely to be called improvements <\s>
<s> some years after when in italy a bookseller published an edition of queen mab as it originally stood <\s>
<s> shelley was hastily written to by his friends under the idea that deeply injurious as the mere distribution of the poem had proved the publication might awaken fresh persecutions <\s>
<s> at the suggestion of these friends he wrote a letter on the subject printed in the examiner newspaper with which i close this history of his earliest work <\s>
<s> to the editor of the examiner <\s>
<s> sir having heard that a poem entitled queen mab has been surreptitiously published in london and that legal proceedings have been instituted against the publisher i request the favour of your insertion of the following explanation of the affair as it relates to me <\s>
<s> a poem entitled queen mab was written by me at the age of eighteen i daresay in a sufficiently intemperate spirit but even then was not intended for publication and a few copies only were struck off to be distributed among my personal friends <\s>
<s> i have not seen this production for several years <\s>
<s> i doubt not but that it is perfectly worthless in point of literary composition and that in all that concerns moral and political speculation as well as in the subtler discriminations of metaphysical and religious doctrine it is still more crude and immature <\s>
<s> i am a devoted enemy to religious political and domestic oppression and i regret this publication not so much from literary vanity as because i fear it is better fitted to injure than to serve the sacred cause of freedom <\s>
<s> i have directed my solicitor to apply to chancery for an injunction to restrain the sale but after the precedent of mr <\s>
<s> southey's wat tyler a poem written i believe at the same age and with the same unreflecting enthusiasm with little hope of success <\s>
<s> whilst i exonerate myself from all share in having divulged opinions hostile to existing sanctions under the form whatever it may be which they assume in this poem it is scarcely necessary for me to protest against the system of inculcating the truth of christianity or the excellence of monarchy however true or however excellent they may be by such equivocal arguments as confiscation and imprisonment and invective and slander and the insolent violation of the most sacred ties of nature and society <\s>

<s> shelley's punctuation or what may be presumed to be his has been retained save in the case of errors whether of the transcriber or the printer overlooked in the revision of the proof sheets and of a few places where the pointing though certainly or seemingly shelley's tends to obscure the sense or grammatical construction <\s>

<s> it was my object to break through the crust of those outworn opinions on which established institutions depend <\s>
<s> i have appealed therefore to the most universal of all feelings and have endeavoured to strengthen the moral sense by forbidding it to waste its energies in seeking to avoid actions which are only crimes of convention <\s>
<s> it is because there is so great a multitude of artificial vices that there are so few real virtues <\s>
<s> those feelings alone which are benevolent or malevolent are essentially good or bad <\s>
<s> the circumstance of which i speak was introduced however merely to accustom men to that charity and toleration which the exhibition of a practice widely differing from their own has a tendency to promote <\s>
<s> the sentiments connected with and characteristic of this circumstance have no personal reference to the writer shelley's note nothing indeed can be more mischievous than many actions innocent in themselves which might bring down upon individuals the bigoted contempt and rage of the multitude <\s>

<s> aught but a lifeless clod until revived by thee dedic <\s>
<s> so rossetti the shelley editions 1818 and 1839 read clog which is retained by forman dowden and woodberry <\s>
<s> rossetti's happy conjecture clod seems to forman a doubtful emendation as shelley may have used clog in its figurative sense of weight encumbrance hardly as here in a poetical figure that would be to use a metaphor within a metaphor <\s>
<s> shelley compares his heart to a concrete object if clog is right the word must be taken in one or other of its two recognized literal senses 'a wooden shoe or a block of wood tied round the neck or to the leg of a horse or a dog <\s>
<s> again it is of others hearts not of his own that shelley here deplores the icy coldness and weight besides how could he appropriately describe his heart as a weight or encumbrance upon the free play of impulse and emotion seeing that for shelley above all men the heart was itself the main source and spring of all feeling and action <\s>
<s> that source he complains has been dried up its emotions desiccated by the crushing impact of other hearts heavy hard and cold as stone <\s>
<s> his heart has become withered and barren like a lump of earth parched with frost 'a lifeless clod <\s>
<s> compare summer and winter lines 11 15 it was a winter such as when birds die in the deep forests and the fishes lie stiffened in the translucent ice which makes even the mud and slime of the warm lakes a wrinkled clod as hard as brick etc etc <\s>
<s> the word revived suits well with clod but what is a revived clog <\s>
<s> finally the first two lines of the following stanza 7 seem decisive in favour of roseetti's word <\s>
<s> if any one wonders how a misprint overlooked in 1818 could after twenty one years still remain undiscovered in 1839 let him consider the case of clog in lamb's parody on southey's and coleridge's dactyls lamb letter to coleridge july 1 1796 ): sorely your dactyls do drag along limp footed sad is the measure that hangs a clog round em so etc etc <\s>
<s> here the misprint clod which in 1868 appeared in moxon's edition of the letters of charles lamb has through five successive editions and under many editors including fitzgerald ainger and macdonald held its ground even to the present day and this notwithstanding the preservation of the true reading clog in the texts of talfourd and carew hazlitt <\s>
<s> here then is the case of a palpable misprint surviving despite positive external evidence of its falsity over a period of thirty six years <\s>
<s> and walked as free etc <\s>
<s> walked is one of shelley's occasional grammatical laxities <\s>
<s> forman well observes that walkedst the right word here would naturally seem to shelley more heinous than a breach of syntactic rule <\s>
<s> rossetti and after him dowden print walk <\s>
<s> forman and woodberry follow the early texts <\s>
<s> here the text follows the punctuation of the editio princeps 1818 with two exceptions a comma is inserted 1 after scale line 201 on the authority of the bodleian manuscript locock ); and 2 after neck line 205 to indicate the true construction <\s>
<s> shelley's text 1839 has a semicolon after plumes line 203 which rossetti adopts <\s>

<s> the testimony of shelley's autograph in the harvard college manuscript however is final against such a punctuation <\s>
<s> in shelley's edition 1820 there is no stop at the end of line 41 and a semicolon closes line 42 <\s>
<s> shelley's editions the various sections of this ode are severally headed as follows epode 1 alpha epode 2 alpha strophe alpha 1 strophe beta 2 antistrophe alpha gamma antistrophe beta gamma antistrophe beta gamma antistrophe alpha gamma epode 1 gamma epode 2 gamma <\s>
<s> in the manuscript mr <\s>
<s> locock tells us the headings are very doubtful many of them being vaguely altered with pen and pencil <\s>
<s> shelley evidently hesitated between two or three alternative ways of indicating the structure and corresponding parts of his elaborate song hence the chaotic jumble of headings printed in editions 1824 1839 <\s>
<s> so far as the epodes are concerned the headings in this edition are those of editions 1824 1839 which may be taken as supported by the manuscript locock <\s>
<s> as to the remaining sections mr <\s>
<s> locock's examination of the manuscript leads him to conclude that shelley's final choice was strophe 1 strophe 2 antistrophe 1 antistrophe 2 antistrophe 1 alpha antistrophe 2 alpha <\s>
<s> this in itself would be perfectly appropriate but it would be inconsistent with the method employed in designating the epodes <\s>
<s> i have therefore adopted in preference a scheme which if it lacks manuscript authority in some particulars has at least the merit of being absolutely logical and consistent throughout <\s>
<s> locock has some interesting remarks on the metrical features of this complex ode <\s>
<s> on the 10th line of antistrophe 1a line 86 of the ode aghast she pass from the earth's disk which exceeds by one foot the 10th lines of the two corresponding divisions strophe 1 and antistrophe 1b he observes happily enough that aghast may well have been intended to disappear <\s>
<s> locock does not seem to notice that the closing lines of these three answering sections 1 hail hail all hail 2 thou shalt be great all hail 3 art thou of all these hopes o hail <\s>
<s> increase by regular lengths two three four iambi <\s>
<s> nor does he seem quite to grasp shelley's intention with regard to the rhyme scheme of the other triple group strophe 2 antistrophe 2a antistrophe 2b <\s>
<s> that of strophe 2 may be thus expressed a a bc d d bc a c d b c <\s>
<s> between this and antistrophe 2a the second member of the group there is a general correspondence with in one particular a subtle modification <\s>
<s> the scheme now becomes a a bc d d bc a c b d c i e <\s>
<s> the rhymes of lines 9 and 10 are transposed god line 9 answering to the halfway rhymes of lines 3 and 6 gawd and unawed instead of as in strophe 2 to the rhyme endings of lines 4 and 5 and vice versa fate line 10 answering to desolate and state lines 4 and 5 instead of to the halfway rhymes aforesaid <\s>
<s> as to antistrophe 2b that follows antistrophe 2a so far as it goes but after line 9 it breaks off suddenly and closes with two lines corresponding in length and rhyme to the closing couplet of antistrophe 1b the section immediately preceding which however belongs not to this group but to the other <\s>
<s> locock speaks of line 124 as a rhymeless line <\s>
<s> rhymeless it is not for shore its rhyme termination answers to bower and power the halfway rhymes of lines 118 and 121 respectively <\s>
<s> locock should call line 12 an unmetrical line i cannot see <\s>
<s> it is a decasyllabic line with a trochee substituted for an iambus in the third foot around me gleamed many a bright se pulchre <\s>
