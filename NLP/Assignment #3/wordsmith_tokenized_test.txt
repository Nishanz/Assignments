<s> my dear friend the tale of peter bell which i now introduce to your notice and to that of the public has in its manuscript state nearly survived its minority for it first saw the light in the summer of 1798 <\s>
<s> during this long interval pains have been taken at different times to make the production less unworthy of a favourable reception or rather to fit it for filling permanently a station however humble in the literature of our country <\s>
<s> this has indeed been the aim of all my endeavours in poetry which you know have been sufficiently laborious to prove that i deem the art not lightly to be approached and that the attainment of excellence in it may laudably be made the principal object of intellectual pursuit by any man who with reasonable consideration of circumstances has faith in his own impulses <\s>
<s> the poem of peter bell as the prologue will show was composed under a belief that the imagination not only does not require for its exercise the intervention of supernatural agency but that though such agency be excluded the faculty may be called forth as imperiously and for kindred results of pleasure by incidents within the compass of poetic probability in the humblest departments of daily life <\s>
<s> since that prologue was written you have exhibited most splendid effects of judicious daring in the opposite and usual course <\s>
<s> let this acknowledgment make my peace with the lovers of the supernatural and i am persuaded it will be admitted that to you as a master in that province of the art the following tale whether from contrast or congruity is not an unappropriate offering <\s>
<s> accept it then as a public testimony of affectionate admiration from one with whose name yours has been often coupled to use your own words for evil and for good and believe me to be with earnest wishes that life and health may be granted you to complete the many important works in which you are engaged and with high respect most faithfully yours william wordsworth <\s>

<s> within the shade your seats and quickly 18 shall be paid the well remembered debt <\s>
<s> i spake with faltering voice like one not wholly rescued from the pale of a wild dream or worse illusion but straight to cover my confusion began the promised tale <\s>

<s> in vain the staff was raised to loftier height and the blows fell with heavier weight as peter struck and struck again <\s>
<s> 195 21 hold <\s>
<s> cried the squire against the rules of common sense you're surely sinning this leap is for us all too bold 22 who peter was let that be told and start from the beginning <\s>
<s> a potter f sir he was by trade said i becoming quite collected and wheresoever he appeared full twenty times was peter feared for once that peter was respected <\s>
<s> he two and thirty years or more had been a wild and woodland rover had heard the atlantic surges roar on farthest cornwall's rocky shore and trod the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> and he had seen caernarvon's towers and well he knew the spire of sarum and he had been where lincoln bell flings o'er the fen that ponderous knell a far renowned alarum <\s>
<s> 215 at doncaster at york and leeds and merry carlisle had he been and all along the lowlands fair all through the bonny shire of ayr and far as aberdeen <\s>
<s> and he had been at inverness and peter by the mountain rills had danced his round with highland lasses and he had lain beside his asses on lofty cheviot hills 225 and he had trudged through yorkshire dales among the rocks and winding scars where deep and low the hamlets lie beneath their little patch of sky and little lot of stars 230 and all along the indented coast bespattered with the salt sea foam where'er a knot of houses lay on headland or in hollow bay sure never man like him did roam <\s>
<s> as well might peter in the fleet have been fast bound a begging debtor he travelled here he travelled there but not the value of a hair was heart or head the better <\s>
<s> he roved among the vales and streams in the green wood and hollow dell they were his dwellings night and day but nature ne'er could find the way into the heart of peter bell <\s>
<s> in vain through every changeful year did nature lead him as before a primrose by a river's brim a yellow primrose was to him and it was nothing more <\s>
<s> small change it made in peter's heart to see his gentle panniered train with more than vernal pleasure feeding where'er the tender grass was leading its earliest green along the lane <\s>
<s> in vain through water earth and air the soul of happy sound was spread when peter on some april morn beneath the broom or budding thorn made the warm earth his lazy bed <\s>
<s> at noon when by the forest's edge he lay beneath the branches high the soft blue sky did never melt into his heart he never felt the witchery of the soft blue sky <\s>
<s> on a fair prospect some have looked and felt as i have heard them say as if the moving time had been a thing as steadfast as the scene on which they gazed themselves away <\s>
<s> within the breast of peter bell these silent raptures found no place 24 he was a carl as wild and rude as ever hue and cry pursued as ever ran a felon's race <\s>
<s> of all that lead a lawless life of all that love their lawless lives in city or in village small he was the wildest far of all he had a dozen wedded wives <\s>
<s> nay start not wedded wives and twelve <\s>
<s> but how one wife could e'er come near him in simple truth i cannot tell for be it said of peter bell to see him was to fear him <\s>
<s> though nature could not touch his heart by lovely forms and silent 25 weather and tender sounds yet you might see at once that peter bell and she had often been together <\s>
<s> a savage wildness round him hung as of a dweller out of doors in his whole figure and his mien a savage character was seen of mountains and of dreary moors <\s>
<s> to all the unshaped half human thoughts which solitary nature feeds mid summer storms or winter's ice had peter joined whatever vice the cruel city breeds <\s>
<s> his face was keen as is the wind that cuts along the hawthorn fence of courage you saw little there but in its stead a medley air of cunning and of impudence <\s>
<s> he had a dark and sidelong walk and long and slouching was his gait beneath his looks so bare and bold you might perceive his spirit cold was playing with some inward bait <\s>
<s> his forehead wrinkled was and furred a work one half of which was done by thinking of his whens and hows and half by knitting of his brows beneath the glaring sun <\s>
<s> there was a hardness in his cheek there was a hardness in his eye as if the man had fixed his face in many a solitary place against the wind and open sky <\s>
<s> one night and now my little bess <\s>
<s> we've reached at last the promised tale ;) one beautiful november night when the full moon was shining bright upon the rapid river swale 325 along the river's winding banks peter was travelling all alone whether to buy or sell or led by pleasure running in his head to me was never known <\s>
<s> he trudged along through copse and brake he trudged along o'er hill and dale nor for the moon cared he a tittle and for the stars he cared as little and for the murmuring river swale <\s>
<s> but chancing to espy a path that promised to cut short the way as many a wiser man hath done he left a trusty guide for one that might his steps betray <\s>
<s> to a thick wood he soon is brought where cheerily 26 his course he weaves and whistling loud may yet be heard though often buried like a bird darkling among the boughs and leaves <\s>
<s> but quickly peter's mood is changed and on he drives with cheeks that burn in downright fury and in wrath there's little sign the treacherous path will to the road return <\s>
<s> the path grows dim and dimmer still now up now down the rover wends with all the sail that he can carry till brought to a deserted quarry 27 and there the pathway ends <\s>
<s> 28 he paused for shadows of strange shape massy and black before him lay but through the dark and through the cold 29 and through the yawning fissures old did peter boldly press his way 360 right through the quarry and behold a scene of soft and lovely hue <\s>
<s> where blue and grey and tender green together make 30 as sweet a scene as ever human eye did view <\s>
<s> beneath the clear blue sky he saw a little field of meadow ground but field or meadow name it not call it of earth a small green plot with rocks encompassed round <\s>
<s> the swale flowed under the grey rocks but he flowed quiet and unseen you need a strong and stormy gale to bring the noises of the swale to that green spot so calm and green <\s>
<s> 31 and is there no one dwelling here no hermit with his beads and glass <\s>
<s> and does no little cottage look upon this soft and fertile nook <\s>
<s> does no one live near this green grass <\s>
<s> across the 32 deep and quiet spot is peter driving through the grass and now has reached the skirting trees 33 when turning round his head he sees a solitary ass <\s>
<s> 34 a prize <\s>
<s> cries peter but he first must spy about him far and near 35 there's not a single house in sight no woodman's hut no cottage light peter you need not fear <\s>
<s> there's nothing to be seen but woods and rocks that spread a hoary gleam and this one beast that from the bed of the green meadow hangs his head over the silent stream <\s>
<s> his head is with a halter bound the halter seizing peter leapt upon the creature's back 36 and plied with ready heels his shaggy side 37 but still the ass his station kept <\s>
<s> 38 then peter gave a sudden jerk a jerk that from a dungeon floor would have pulled up an iron ring but still the heavy headed thing stood just as he had stood before <\s>
<s> quoth peter leaping from his seat there is some plot against me laid once more the little meadow ground and all the hoary cliffs around he cautiously surveyed <\s>
<s> all all is silent rocks and woods all still and silent far and near <\s>
<s> only the ass with motion dull upon the pivot of his skull turns round his long left ear <\s>
<s> thought peter what can mean all this <\s>
<s> some ugly witchcraft must be here <\s>
<s> once more the ass with motion dull upon the pivot of his skull turned round his long left ear <\s>
<s> suspicion ripened into dread yet with deliberate action slow his staff high raising in the pride of skill upon the sounding hide 39 he dealt a sturdy blow <\s>
<s> the poor ass staggered with the shock and then as if to take his ease 40 in quiet uncomplaining mood upon the spot where he had stood dropped gently down upon his knees 430 as gently on 41 his side he fell and by the river's brink did lie and while 42 he lay like one that mourned the patient beast on peter turned his shining hazel eye <\s>
<s> 435 twas but one mild reproachful look a look more tender than severe and straight in sorrow not in dread he turned the eye ball in his head towards the smooth river 44 deep and clear <\s>
<s> upon the beast the sapling rings his lank sides heaved 45 his limbs they stirred he gave a groan and then another of that which went before the brother and then he gave a third <\s>
<s> all by the moonlight river side he gave three miserable groans and not till now hath peter seen how gaunt the creature is how lean and sharp his staring bones <\s>
<s> 450 with legs stretched out and stiff he lay no word of kind commiseration fell at the sight from peter's tongue with hard contempt his heart was wrung with hatred and vexation <\s>
<s> the meagre beast lay still as death and peter's lips with fury quiver quoth he you little mulish dog i'll fling your carcass like a log head foremost down the river <\s>
<s> an impious oath confirmed the threat whereat from the earth on which he lay 47 to all the echoes south and north and east and west the ass sent forth a long and clamorous bray <\s>
<s> 465 this outcry on the heart of peter seems like a note of joy to strike joy at 49 the heart of peter knocks but in the echo of the rocks was something peter did not like <\s>
<s> whether to cheer his coward breast or that he could not break the chain in this serene and solemn hour twined round him by demoniac power to the blind work he turned again <\s>
<s> among the rocks and winding crags among the mountains far away once more the ass did lengthen out more ruefully a deep drawn shout the hard dry see saw of his horrible bray <\s>
<s> 480 what is there now in peter's heart <\s>
<s> or whence the might of this strange sound <\s>
<s> the moon uneasy looked and dimmer the broad blue heavens appeared to glimmer and the rocks staggered all around 485 from peter's hand the sapling dropped <\s>
<s> threat has he none to execute if any one should come and see that i am here they'll think quoth he i'm helping this poor dying brute <\s>
<s> he scans the ass from limb to limb and ventures now to uplift his eyes more steady looks the moon and clear more like themselves the rocks appear and touch more quiet skies <\s>
<s> 495 his scorn returns his hate revives he stoops the ass's neck to seize with malice that again takes flight for in the pool a startling sight meets him among the inverted trees <\s>
<s> 500 is it the moon's distorted face <\s>
<s> the ghost like image of a cloud <\s>
<s> is it a gallows 53 there portrayed <\s>
<s> is peter of himself afraid <\s>
<s> is it a coffin or a shroud <\s>
<s> a grisly idol hewn in stone <\s>
<s> or imp from witch's lap let fall <\s>
<s> perhaps a ring of shining fairies <\s>
<s> such as pursue their feared vagaries 54 in sylvan bower or haunted hall <\s>
<s> is it a fiend that to a stake of fire his desperate self is tethering <\s>
<s> or stubborn spirit doomed to yell in solitary ward or cell ten thousand miles from all his brethren <\s>
<s> 55 never did pulse so quickly throb and never heart so loudly panted 56 he looks he cannot choose but look like some one reading in a book 57 a book that is enchanted <\s>
<s> ah well a day for peter bell <\s>
<s> he will be turned to iron soon meet statue for the court of fear <\s>
<s> his hat is up and every hair bristles and whitens in the moon <\s>
<s> he looks he ponders looks again he sees a motion hears a groan his eyes will burst his heart will break he gives a loud and frightful shriek and back he falls 58 as if his life were flown <\s>
<s> part second we left our hero in a trance beneath the alders near the river the ass is by the river side and where the feeble breezes glide upon the stream the moonbeams quiver <\s>
<s> a happy respite <\s>
<s> but at length he feels the glimmering of the moon wakes with glazed eye and feebly sighing to sink perhaps where he is lying into a second swoon <\s>
<s> 540 he lifts his head he sees his staff he touches 'tis to him a treasure <\s>
<s> faint recollection seems to tell that he is yet where mortals dwell a thought received with languid pleasure <\s>
<s> his head upon his elbow propped becoming less and less perplexed sky ward he looks to rock and wood and then upon the glassy 60 flood his wandering eye is fixed <\s>
<s> thought he that is the face of one in his last sleep securely bound <\s>
<s> so toward the stream his head he bent and downward thrust his staff intent the river's depth to sound <\s>
<s> 555 now like a tempest shattered bark that overwhelmed and prostrate lies and in a moment to the verge is lifted of a foaming surge full suddenly the ass doth rise <\s>
<s> his staring bones all shake with joy and close by peter's side he stands while peter o'er the river bends the little ass his neck extends and fondly licks his hands <\s>
<s> such life is in the ass's eyes such life is in his limbs and ears that peter bell if he had been the veriest coward ever seen must now have thrown aside his fears <\s>
<s> the ass looks on and to his work is peter quietly resigned he touches here he touches there and now among the dead man's hair his sapling peter has entwined <\s>
<s> he pulls and looks and pulls again and he whom the poor ass had lost the man who had been four days dead head foremost from the river's bed uprises like a ghost <\s>
<s> g 580 and peter draws him to dry land and through the brain of peter pass some poignant twitches fast and faster no doubt quoth he he is the master of this poor miserable ass <\s>
<s> the meagre shadow that looks on what would he now <\s>
<s> what is he doing <\s>
<s> his sudden fit of joy is flown he on his knees hath laid him down as if he were his grief renewing 590 but no that peter on his back must mount he shows well as he can 63 thought peter then come weal or woe i'll do what he would have me do in pity to this poor drowned man <\s>
<s> with that resolve he boldly mounts 64 upon the pleased and thankful ass and then without a moment's stay that 65 earnest creature turned away leaving the body on the grass <\s>
<s> intent upon his faithful watch the beast four days and nights had past a sweeter meadow ne'er was seen and there the ass four days had been nor ever once did break his fast 605 yet firm his step and stout his heart the mead is crossed the quarry's mouth is reached but there the trusty guide into a thicket turns aside and deftly ambles 66 towards the south <\s>
<s> when hark a burst of doleful sound <\s>
<s> and peter honestly might say the like came never to his ears though he has been full thirty years a rover night and day <\s>
<s> tis not a plover of the moors tis not a bittern of the fen nor can it be a barking fox nor night bird chambered in the rocks nor wild cat in a woody glen <\s>
<s> the ass is startled and stops short right in the middle of the thicket and peter wont to whistle loud whether alone or in a crowd is silent as a silent cricket <\s>
<s> what ails you now my little bess <\s>
<s> well may you tremble and look grave <\s>
<s> this cry that rings along the wood this cry that floats adown the flood comes from the entrance of a cave 630 i see a blooming wood boy there and if i had the power to say how sorrowful the wanderer is your heart would be as sad as his till you had kissed his tears away <\s>
<s> grasping 67 a hawthorn branch in hand all bright with berries ripe and red into the cavern's mouth he peeps thence back into the moonlight creeps whom seeks he whom the silent dead 68 640 his father him doth he require him hath he sought 69 with fruitless pains among the rocks behind the trees now creeping on his hands and knees now running o'er the open plains <\s>
<s> and hither is he come at last when he through such a day has gone by this dark cave to be distrest like a poor bird her plundered nest hovering around with dolorous moan <\s>
<s> of that intense and piercing cry the listening ass conjectures well 70 wild as it is he there can read some intermingled notes that plead with touches irresistible <\s>
<s> but peter when he saw the ass not only stop but turn and change the cherished tenor of his pace that lamentable cry 71 to chase it wrought in him conviction strange 660 a faith that for the dead man's sake and this poor slave who loved him well vengeance upon his head will fall some visitation worse than all which ever till this night befel <\s>
<s> meanwhile the ass to reach his home 72 is striving stoutly as he may but while he climbs the woody hill the cry grows weak and weaker still and now at last it dies away <\s>
<s> so with his freight the creature turns into a gloomy grove of beech along the shade with footsteps 73 true descending slowly till the two the open moonlight reach <\s>
<s> and there along the 74 narrow dell a fair smooth pathway you discern a length of green and open road as if it from a fountain flowed winding away between the fern <\s>
<s> the rocks that tower on either side build up a wild fantastic scene temples like those among the hindoos and mosques and spires and abbey windows and castles all with ivy green <\s>
<s> and while the ass pursues his way along this solitary dell as pensively his steps advance the mosques and spires change countenance and look at peter bell <\s>
<s> that unintelligible cry hath left him high in preparation convinced that he or soon or late this very night will meet his fate and so he sits in expectation <\s>
<s> 75 the strenuous animal hath clomb with the green path and now he wends where shining like the smoothest sea in undisturbed immensity a 76 level plain extends <\s>
<s> but whence this faintly rustling sound by which the journeying pair are chased <\s>
<s> a withered leaf is close behind 77 light plaything for the sportive wind upon that solitary waste <\s>
<s> when peter spied the moving thing it only doubled his distress 78 where there is not a bush or tree the very leaves they follow me so huge hath been my wickedness <\s>
<s> to a close lane they now are come where as before the enduring ass moves on without a moment's stop nor once turns round his head to crop a bramble leaf or blade of grass <\s>
<s> between the hedges as they go the white dust sleeps upon the lane and peter ever and anon back looking sees upon a stone or in the dust a crimson stain <\s>

<s> the godly book was in his hand and on the page more black than coal appeared set forth in strange array a word which to his dying day perplexed the good man's gentle soul <\s>

<s> our travellers ye remember well are thridding a sequestered lane and peter many tricks is trying and many anodynes applying to ease his conscience of its pain <\s>
<s> by this his heart is lighter far and finding that he can account so snugly 90 for that crimson stain his evil spirit up again does like an empty bucket mount <\s>
<s> and peter is a deep logician who hath no lack of wit mercurial blood drops leaves rustle yet quoth he this poor man never but for me could have had christian burial <\s>
<s> and say the best you can tis plain that here has 91 been some wicked dealing no doubt the devil in me wrought i'm not the man who could have thought an ass like this was worth the stealing <\s>
<s> so from his pocket peter takes his shining horn tobacco box and in a light and careless way as men who with their purpose play upon the lid he knocks <\s>
<s> let them whose voice can stop the clouds whose cunning eye can see the wind tell to a curious world the cause why making here a sudden pause the ass turned round his head and grinned <\s>
<s> i have marked the like on heath in lonely wood and verily have seldom met a spectacle more hideous yet it suited peter's present mood <\s>
<s> and grinning in his turn his teeth he in jocose defiance showed when to upset 92 his spiteful mirth a murmur pent within the earth in the dead earth beneath the road 835 rolled audibly <\s>
<s> it swept along a muffled noise a rumbling sound twas by a troop of miners made plying with gunpowder their trade some twenty fathoms underground <\s>

<s> but as an oak in breathless air will stand though to the centre hewn or as the weakest things if frost have stiffened them maintain their post so he beneath the gazing moon 850 the beast bestriding thus he reached a spot where in a sheltering cove 93 a little chapel stands alone with greenest ivy overgrown and tufted with an ivy grove 855 dying insensibly away from human thoughts and purposes it seemed wall window roof and tower 94 to bow to some transforming power and blend with the surrounding trees <\s>
<s> as ruinous a place it was thought peter in the shire of fife that served my turn when following still from land to land a reckless will 95 i married my sixth wife <\s>
<s> the unheeding ass moves slowly on and now is passing by an inn brim full of a carousing crew that make 96 with curses not a few an uproar and a drunken din <\s>
<s> i cannot well express the thoughts which peter in those noises found a stifling power compressed his frame while as a swimming darkness came 97 over that dull and dreary sound <\s>
<s> for well did peter know the sound the language of those drunken joys to him a jovial soul i ween but a few hours ago had been a gladsome and a welcome noise <\s>
<s> now 98 turned adrift into the past he finds no solace in his course like planet stricken men of yore he trembles smitten to the core by strong compunction and remorse <\s>
<s> but more than all his heart is stung to think of one almost a child a sweet and playful highland girl as light and beauteous as a squirrel as beauteous and as wild <\s>
<s> her dwelling was a lonely house 99 a cottage in a heathy dell and she put on her gown of green and left her mother at sixteen and followed peter bell <\s>
<s> but many good and pious thoughts had she and in the kirk to pray two long scotch miles through rain or snow to kirk she had been used to go twice every sabbath day <\s>
<s> and when she followed peter bell it was to lead an honest life for he with tongue not used to falter had pledged his troth before the altar to love her as his wedded wife <\s>
<s> a mother's hope is hers but soon she drooped and pined like one forlorn from scripture she a name 100 did borrow benoni or the child of sorrow she called her babe unborn <\s>
<s> for she had learned how peter lived and took it in most grievous part she to the very bone was worn and ere that little child was born died of a broken heart <\s>
<s> and now the spirits of the mind are busy with poor peter bell upon the rights of visual sense usurping with a prevalence more terrible than magic spell <\s>
<s> 920 close by a brake of flowering furze above it shivering aspens play he sees an unsubstantial creature his very self in form and feature not four yards from the broad highway 925 and stretched beneath the furze he sees the highland girl it is no other and hears her crying as she cried the very moment that she died my mother <\s>
<s> the sweat pours down from peter's face so grievous is his heart's contrition with agony his eye balls ache while he beholds by the furze brake this miserable vision <\s>
<s> calm is the well deserving brute his peace hath no offence betrayed but now while down that slope he wends a voice to peter's ear 102 ascends resounding from the woody glade 940 the voice though clamorous as a horn re echoed by a naked rock comes from that tabernacle list <\s>
<s> within a fervent 104 methodist is preaching to no heedless flock <\s>
<s> he cries aloud while yet ye may find mercy strive to love the lord with all your might turn to him seek him day and night and save your souls alive <\s>
<s> though ye have gone through paths of wickedness and woe after the babylonian harlot and though your sins be red as scarlet they shall be white as snow <\s>
<s> even as he passed the door these words did plainly come to peter's ears and they such joyful tidings were the joy was more than he could bear he melted into tears <\s>
<s> sweet tears of hope and tenderness <\s>
<s> and fast they fell a plenteous shower <\s>
<s> his nerves his sinews seemed to melt through all his iron frame was felt a gentle a relaxing power <\s>
<s> each fibre of his frame was weak weak all the animal within but in its helplessness grew mild and gentle as an infant child an infant that has known no sin <\s>
<s> tis said meek beast <\s>

<s> meanwhile the persevering ass turned towards a gate that hung in view across a shady lane 108 his chest against the yielding gate he pressed and quietly passed through <\s>
<s> and up the stony lane he goes no ghost more softly ever trod among the stones and pebbles he sets down his hoofs inaudibly as if with felt his hoofs were shod <\s>
<s> along the lane the trusty ass went twice two hundred yards or more and no one could have guessed his aim till to a lonely house he came and stopped beside the door <\s>
<s> 995 thought peter tis the poor man's home <\s>
<s> he listens not a sound is heard save from the trickling household rill but stepping o'er the cottage sill forthwith a little girl appeared <\s>
<s> she to the meeting house was bound in hopes 110 some tidings there to gather no glimpse it is no doubtful gleam she saw and uttered with a scream my father <\s>
<s> the very word was plainly heard heard plainly by the wretched mother her joy was like a deep affright and forth she rushed into the light and saw it was another <\s>
<s> and instantly upon the earth beneath the full moon shining bright close to 111 the ass's feet she fell at the same moment peter bell dismounts in most unhappy plight <\s>
<s> as he beheld the woman lie 112 breathless and motionless the mind of peter sadly was confused but though to such demands unused and helpless almost as the blind 1020 he raised her up and while he held her body propped against his knee the woman waked and when she spied the poor ass standing by her side she moaned most bitterly <\s>
<s> god be praised my heart's at ease for he is dead i know it well <\s>
<s> at this she wept a bitter flood and in the best way that he could his tale did peter tell <\s>
<s> he trembles he is pale as death his voice is weak with perturbation he turns aside his head he pauses poor peter from a thousand causes is crippled sore in his narration <\s>
<s> at length she learned how he espied the ass in that small meadow ground and that her husband now lay dead beside that luckless river's bed in which he had been drowned <\s>
<s> a piercing look the widow 113 cast upon the beast that near her stands she sees tis he that tis the same she calls the poor ass by his name and wrings and wrings her hands <\s>
<s> o wretched loss untimely stroke <\s>
<s> if he had died upon his bed <\s>
<s> he knew not one forewarning pain he never will come home again is dead for ever dead <\s>
<s> beside the woman peter stands his heart is opening more and more a holy sense pervades his mind he feels what he for human kind had never felt before <\s>
<s> at length by peter's arm sustained the woman rises from the ground oh mercy <\s>
<s> something must be done my little rachel you must run some willing neighbour must be found <\s>
<s> make haste my little rachel do the first you meet with bid him come ask him to lend his horse to night and this good man whom heaven requite will help to bring the body home <\s>
<s> away goes rachel weeping loud an infant waked by her distress makes in the house a piteous cry and peter hears the mother sigh seven are they and all fatherless <\s>
<s> and now is peter taught to feel that man's heart is a holy thing and nature through a world of death breathes into him a second breath more searching than the breath of spring <\s>
<s> upon a stone the woman sits in agony of silent grief from his own thoughts did peter start he longs to press her to his heart from love that cannot find relief <\s>
<s> but roused as if through every limb had past a sudden shock of dread the mother o'er the threshold flies and up the cottage stairs 114 she hies and on the pillow lays 115 her burning head <\s>
<s> and peter turns his steps aside into a shade of darksome trees where he sits down he knows not how with his hands pressed against his brow his elbows on 116 his tremulous knees <\s>
<s> there self involved does peter sit until no sign of life he makes as if his mind were sinking deep through years that have been long asleep <\s>
<s> the trance is passed away he wakes 1095 he lifts 117 his head and sees the ass yet standing in the clear moonshine when shall i be as good as thou <\s>

<s> but he who deviously hath sought his father through the lonesome woods hath sought proclaiming to the ear of night his grief and sorrowful fear 118 he comes escaped from fields and floods 1105 with weary pace is drawing nigh he sees the ass and nothing living had ever such a fit of joy as hath 119 this little orphan boy for he has no misgiving <\s>
<s> forth to 120 the gentle ass he springs and up about his neck he climbs in loving words he talks to him he kisses kisses face and limb he kisses him a thousand times <\s>

<s> god i can endure no more <\s>
<s> here ends my tale for in a trice arrived a neighbour with his horse peter went forth with him straightway and with due care ere break of day together they brought back the corse <\s>
<s> and many years did this poor ass whom once it was my luck to see cropping the shrubs of leming lane help by his labour to maintain the widow and her family <\s>

<s> five years have past five summers with the length of five long winters c and again i hear these waters rolling from their mountain springs with a soft 1 inland murmur <\s>
<s> d once again do i behold these steep and lofty cliffs 5 that 2 on a wild secluded scene impress thoughts of more deep seclusion and connect the landscape with the quiet of the sky <\s>
<s> the day is come when i again repose here under this dark sycamore and view 10 these plots of cottage ground these orchard tufts which at this season with their unripe fruits are clad in one green hue and lose themselves mid groves and copses <\s>
<s> once again i see these hedge rows hardly hedge rows little lines 15 of sportive wood run wild these pastoral farms green to the very door and wreaths of smoke sent up in silence from among the trees <\s>
<s> e with some uncertain notice as might seem of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods 20 or of some hermit's cave where by his fire the hermit sits alone <\s>
<s> these beauteous forms through a long absence have not been to me 4 as is a landscape to a blind man's eye 25 but oft in lonely rooms and mid the din of towns and cities i have owed to them in hours of weariness sensations sweet felt in the blood and felt along the heart and passing even into my purer mind 5 30 with tranquil restoration feelings too of unremembered pleasure such perhaps as have no slight or trivial influence 6 on that best portion of a good man's life his little nameless unremembered acts 35 of kindness and of love <\s>
<s> nor less i trust to them i may have owed another gift of aspect more sublime that blessed mood in which the burthen of the mystery in which the heavy and the weary weight 40 of all this unintelligible world is lightened that serene and blessed mood in which the affections gently lead us on until the breath of this corporeal frame and even the motion of our human blood 45 almost suspended we are laid asleep in body and become a living soul while with an eye made quiet by the power of harmony and the deep power of joy we see into the life of things <\s>
<s> if this be but a vain belief yet oh <\s>
<s> how oft in darkness and amid the many shapes of joyless daylight when the fretful stir unprofitable and the fever of the world 55 have hung upon the beatings of my heart how oft in spirit have i turned to thee o sylvan wye <\s>
<s> thou wanderer thro the woods 7 how often has my spirit turned to thee <\s>
<s> and now with gleams of half extinguished thought 60 with many recognitions dim and faint and somewhat of a sad perplexity the picture of the mind revives again while here i stand not only with the sense of present pleasure but with pleasing thoughts 65 that in this moment there is life and food for future years <\s>
<s> and so i dare to hope though changed no doubt from what i was when first i came among these hills when like a roe i bounded o'er the mountains by the sides 70 of the deep rivers and the lonely streams wherever nature led more like a man flying from something that he dreads than one who sought the thing he loved <\s>
<s> for nature then the coarser pleasures of my boyish days 75 and their glad animal movements all gone by to me was all in all i cannot paint what then i was <\s>
<s> the sounding cataract haunted me like a passion the tall rock the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood 80 their colours and their forms were then to me an appetite a feeling and a love that had no need of a remoter charm by thought supplied nor [8 any interest unborrowed from the eye that time is past 85 and all its aching joys are now no more and all its dizzy raptures <\s>
<s> f not for this faint i nor mourn nor murmur other gifts have followed for such loss i would believe abundant recompence <\s>
<s> for i have learned 90 to look on nature not as in the hour of thoughtless youth but hearing oftentimes the still sad music of humanity nor 9 harsh nor grating though of ample power to chasten and subdue <\s>
<s> and i have felt 95 a presence that disturbs me with the joy of elevated thoughts a sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused whose dwelling is the light of setting suns and the round ocean and the living air 100 and the blue sky and in the mind of man a motion and a spirit that impels all thinking things all objects of all thought and rolls through all things <\s>
<s> therefore am i still a lover of the meadows and the woods 105 and mountains and of all that we behold from this green earth of all the mighty world of eye and ear both what they half create g and what perceive well pleased to recognise in nature and the language of the sense 110 the anchor of my purest thoughts the nurse the guide the guardian of my heart and soul of all my moral being <\s>
<s> nor perchance if i were not thus taught should i the more 115 suffer my genial spirits to decay for thou art with me here upon the banks of this fair river thou my dearest friend my dear dear friend and in thy voice i catch the language of my former heart and read 120 my former pleasures in the shooting lights of thy wild eyes h oh <\s>
<s> yet a little while may i behold in thee what i was once my dear dear sister <\s>
<s> and this prayer i make knowing that nature never did betray 125 the heart that loved her tis her privilege through all the years of this our life to lead from joy to joy for she can so inform the mind that is within us so impress with quietness and beauty and so feed 130 with lofty thoughts that neither evil tongues rash judgments nor the sneers of selfish men nor greetings where no kindness is nor all the dreary intercourse of daily life shall e'er prevail against us or disturb 135 our cheerful faith that all which we behold is full of blessings <\s>
<s> therefore let the moon shine on thee in thy solitary walk and let the misty mountain winds be free to blow against thee and in after years 140 when these wild ecstasies shall be matured into a sober pleasure when thy mind shall be a mansion for all lovely forms thy memory be as a dwelling place for all sweet sounds and harmonies oh <\s>
<s> then 145 if solitude or fear or pain or grief should be thy portion with what healing thoughts of tender joy wilt thou remember me and these my exhortations <\s>
<s> nor perchance if i should be where i no more can hear 150 thy voice nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams of past existence b wilt thou then forget that on the banks of this delightful stream we stood together and that i so long a worshipper of nature hither came 155 unwearied in that service rather say with warmer love oh <\s>

<s> then downwards 7 from the steep hill's edge 45 they tracked the footmarks small and through the broken hawthorn hedge and by the long stone wall and then an open field they crossed the marks were still the same 50 they tracked them on nor ever lost and [8 to the bridge they came <\s>

<s> a contributor to notes and queries may 12 1883 whose signature is f writes the scene of lucy gray in one of the editions of wordsworth's works the scene of this ballad is said to have been near halifax in yorkshire <\s>
<s> i do not think the poet was acquainted with the locality beyond a sight of the country in travelling through on some journey <\s>

<s> there is no minster the church at halifax from time immemorial has always been known as the parish church and sometimes as the old church but has never been styled the minster <\s>
<s> the mountain roe which of course may be brought in as poetically illustrative has not been seen on these hills for generations and i scarcely think even the fawn at play for more than a hundred years <\s>
<s> these misapplications it is almost unnecessary to say do not detract from the beauty of the poetry <\s>
<s> some of the touches are graphically true to the neighbourhood as for instance the wide moor the many a hill the steep hill's edge the long stone wall and the hint of the general loneliness of the region where lucy no mate no comrade knew <\s>
<s> i think i can point out the exact spot no longer a plank but a broad safe bridge where lucy fell into the water <\s>
<s> taking a common sense view that she would not be sent many miles at two o'clock on a winter afternoon to the town halifax of course over so lonely a mountain moor bearing in mind also that this moor overlooked the river and that the river was deep and strong enough to carry the child down the current i know only one place where such an accident could have occurred <\s>
<s> the clue is in this verse at day break on a hill they stood that overlooked the moor and thence they saw the bridge of wood a furlong from their door <\s>
<s> the hill i take to be the high ridge of greetland and norland moor and the plank she had to cross sterne mill bridge which there spans the calder broad and rapid enough at any season to drown either a young girl or a grown up person <\s>
<s> the mountain burns romantic and wild though they be are not dangerous to cross especially for a child old enough to go and seek her mother <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the hill overlooking the moor the path to and distance from the town the bridge the current all indicate one point and one point only where this accident could have happened and that is the bridge near sterne mill <\s>

<s> the author of tristram shandy spent his boyhood here and lucy gray had she safely crossed the plank would immediately have passed wood hall where the boy laurence had lived and pursuing her way to halifax would have gone through the meadows in which stood heath school where young sterne had been educated <\s>

<s> we left sockburn last tuesday morning <\s>
<s> we crossed the tees by moonlight in the sockburn fields and after ten good miles riding came in sight of the swale <\s>

<s> we were now in wensleydale and d <\s>
<s> and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal .... <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads .... <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various lamin ?? of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant .... <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day .... <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated .... <\s>
<s> it was bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty .... <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
<s> the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered with water plants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant <\s>
<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>
<s> what a scene too in summer <\s>
<s> in the luxury of our imagination we could not help feeding upon the pleasure which this cave in the heat of a july noon would spread through a frame exquisitely sensible <\s>
<s> that huge rock on the right the bank winding round on the left with all its living foliage and the breeze stealing up the valley and bedewing the cavern with the freshest imaginable spray <\s>

<s> and climbing 13 up the hill it was at least four 14 roods of sheer ascent sir walter found 50 three several hoof marks which the hunted beast 15 had left imprinted on the grassy 16 ground <\s>
<s> sir walter wiped his face and cried till now such sight was never seen by human 17 eyes three leaps have borne him from this lofty brow 55 down to the very fountain where he lies <\s>
<s> i'll build a pleasure house upon this spot and a small arbour made for rural joy twill be the traveller's shed the pilgrim's cot a place of love for damsels that are coy <\s>
<s> a cunning artist will i have to frame a basin for that fountain in the dell <\s>
<s> and they who do make mention of the same from this day forth shall call it hart leap well <\s>
<s> to make thy praises known 65 another monument shall here be raised three several pillars each a rough hewn stone and planted where thy hoofs the turf have grazed <\s>
<s> and in the summer time when days are long i will come hither with my paramour 70 and with the dancers and the minstrel's song we will make merry in that pleasant bower <\s>
<s> till the foundations of the mountains fail my mansion with its arbour shall endure the joy of them who till the fields of swale 75 and them who dwell among the woods of ure <\s>
<s> then home he went and left the hart stone dead with breathless nostrils stretched above the spring <\s>
<s> soon did the knight perform what he had said and far and wide the fame thereof did ring <\s>
<s> 80 ere thrice the moon into her port had steered a cup of stone received the living well three pillars of rude stone sir walter reared and built a house of pleasure in the dell <\s>
<s> and near the fountain flowers of stature tall 85 with trailing plants and trees were intertwined which soon composed a little sylvan hall a leafy shelter from the sun and wind <\s>
<s> and thither when the summer days were long sir walter led his wondering paramour 20 90 and with the dancers and the minstrel's song made merriment within that pleasant bower <\s>
<s> the knight sir walter died in course of time and his bones lie in his paternal vale but there is matter for a second rhyme 95 and i to this would add another tale <\s>
<s> part second the moving accident a is not my trade to freeze the blood i have no ready arts tis my delight alone in summer shade to pipe a simple song for 21 thinking hearts <\s>
<s> as i from hawes to richmond did repair it chanced that i saw standing in a dell three aspens at three corners of a square and one not four yards distant near a well <\s>
<s> what this imported i could ill divine 105 and pulling now the rein my horse to stop i saw three pillars standing in a line the last stone pillar on a dark hill top <\s>
<s> the trees were grey with neither arms nor head half wasted the square mound of tawny green 110 so that you just might say as then i said here in old time the hand of man hath 22 been <\s>
<s> i looked upon the hill 23 both far and near more doleful place did never eye survey it seemed as if the spring time came not here 115 and nature here were willing to decay <\s>
<s> i stood in various thoughts and fancies lost b when one who was in shepherd's garb attired came up the hollow him did i accost and what this place might be i then inquired <\s>
<s> the shepherd stopped and that same story told which in my former rhyme i have rehearsed <\s>
<s> a jolly place said he in times of old <\s>
<s> but something ails it now the spot is curst <\s>
<s> you see these lifeless stumps of aspen wood 125 some say that they are beeches others elms these were the bower and here a mansion stood the finest palace of a hundred realms <\s>
<s> the arbour does its own condition tell you see the stones the fountain and the stream 130 but as to the great lodge <\s>
<s> you might as well hunt half a day for a forgotten dream <\s>
<s> there's neither dog nor heifer horse nor sheep will wet his lips within that cup of stone and oftentimes when all are fast asleep 135 this water doth send forth a dolorous groan <\s>
<s> some say that here a murder has been done and blood cries out for blood but for my part i've guessed when i've been sitting in the sun that it was all for that unhappy hart <\s>
<s> what thoughts must through the creature's brain have past <\s>
<s> even from the topmost stone upon the steep 24 are but three bounds and look sir at this last o master <\s>
<s> it has been a cruel leap <\s>
<s> for thirteen hours he ran a desperate race 145 and in my simple mind we cannot tell what cause the hart might have to love this place and come and make his death bed near the well <\s>
<s> here on the grass perhaps asleep he sank lulled by the 25 fountain in the summer tide 150 this water was perhaps the first he drank when he had wandered from his mother's side <\s>
<s> in april here beneath the flowering 26 thorn he heard the birds their morning carols sing and he perhaps for aught we know was born 155 not half a furlong from that self same spring <\s>
<s> now here is 27 neither grass nor pleasant shade the sun on drearier hollow never shone so will it be as i have often said till trees and stones and fountain all are gone <\s>
<s> grey headed shepherd thou hast spoken well small difference lies between thy creed and mine this beast not unobserved by nature fell his death was mourned by sympathy divine <\s>
<s> the being that is in the clouds and air 165 that is in the green leaves among the groves maintains a deep and reverential care for the unoffending creatures 28 whom he loves <\s>
<s> the pleasure house is dust behind before this is no common waste no common gloom 170 but nature in due course of time once more shall here put on her beauty and her bloom <\s>
<s> she leaves these objects to a slow decay that what we are and have been may be known but at the coming of the milder day 175 these monuments shall all be overgrown <\s>

<s> i owe the following local note on hart leap well to mr <\s>
<s> visited hart leap well the subject of wordsworth's poem <\s>
<s> it is situated on the road side leading from richmond to askrigg at a distance of not more than three and a half miles from richmond and not five miles as stated in the prefatory note to the poem <\s>
<s> the three aspens at three corners of a square are things of the past also the three stone pillars standing in a line on the hill above <\s>
<s> in a straight line with the spring of water and where the pillars would have been a wall has been built so that it is very probable the stone pillars were removed at the time of the building of this wall <\s>
<s> the scenery around answers exactly to the description more doleful place did never eye survey it seemed as if the spring time came not here and nature here were willing to decay <\s>
<s> now here is neither grass nor pleasant shade <\s>
<s> it is barren moor for miles around <\s>
<s> the water still falls into the cup of stone which appeared to be of very long standing <\s>
<s> within ten yards of the well is a small tree at the same side of the road as the well on the right hand coming from richmond <\s>
<s> thomas hutchinson of kimbolton wrote to me on june 18 1883 the tree is not a thorn but a lime <\s>
<s> it is evidently an old one but is now in full and beautiful leaf <\s>
<s> it stands on the western side of the road and a few yards distant from it <\s>
<s> the well is somewhat nearer the road <\s>
<s> this side of the road is open to the fell <\s>
<s> on the other side the road is bounded by a stone wall another wall meeting this one at right angles exactly opposite the well <\s>
<s> i ascended the hill on the north side of this wall for some distance but could find no trace of any rough hewn stone <\s>
<s> descending on the other side i found in the wall one and only one such stone <\s>
<s> i should say the base was in the wall <\s>
<s> the stone itself leans outwards so that at the top three of its square faces can be seen and two if not three of these faces bear marks of being hammer dressed <\s>
<s> the distance from the stone to the well is about 40 yards and the height of the stone out of the ground about 3 or 4 feet <\s>
<s> the ascent from the well is a gentle one not sheer nor does there appear to be any hollow by which the shepherd could ascend <\s>
<s> on the western side of the road there is a wide plain with a slight fall in that direction <\s>
<s> hart leap well is the tale for me in matter as good as this peter bell ); in manner infinitely before it in my poor judgment <\s>

<s> i will only add a little monitory anecdote concerning this subject <\s>
<s> when coleridge and southey were walking together upon the fells southey observed that if i wished to be considered a faithful painter of rural manners i ought not to have said that my shepherd boys trimmed their rustic hats as described in the poem <\s>
<s> just as the words had passed his lips two boys appeared with the very plant entwined round their hats <\s>
<s> i have often wondered that southey who rambled so much about the mountains should have fallen into this mistake and i record it as a warning for others who with far less opportunity than my dear friend had of knowing what things are and far less sagacity give way to presumptuous criticism from which he was free though in this matter mistaken <\s>

<s> i have composed thousands of verses by the side of it i <\s>
<s> f it was an april morning fresh and clear the rivulet delighting in its strength ran with a young man's speed and yet the voice of waters which the winter had supplied was softened down into a vernal tone <\s>

<s> at length i to a sudden turning came 20 in this continuous glen where down a rock the stream so ardent in its course before sent forth such sallies of glad sound that all which i till then had heard appeared the voice of common pleasure beast and bird the lamb 25 the shepherd's dog the linnet and the thrush vied with this waterfall and made a song which while i listened seemed like the wild growth or like some natural produce of the air that could not cease to be <\s>

<s> cradock the principal of brasenose college oxford took me to a place of which he afterwards wrote i have a fancy for a spot just beyond goody bridge to the left where the brook makes a curve and returns to the road two hundred yards farther on <\s>
<s> but i have not discovered a trace of authority in favour of the idea farther than that the wooded bend of the brook with the stepping stones across it connected with a field path recently stopped was a very favourite haunt of wordsworth's <\s>
<s> at the upper part of this bend near to the place where the brook returns to the road is a deep pool at the foot of a rush of water <\s>
<s> in this pool a man named wilson was drowned many years ago <\s>
<s> he lived at a house on the hill called score crag which if my conjecture as to emma's dell is right is the single mountain cottage on a summit distant a short space <\s>

<s> 315 there is a record of a walk they took up easdale to this place entering the field just at the spot which dr <\s>
<s> cradock supposes to be emma's dell <\s>
<s> he turned aside at a little farm house and took us into a swelling field to look down on the tumbling stream which bounded it and which we saw precipitated at a distance in a broad white sheet from the mountain <\s>
<s> this refers to easdale force then as he mused for an instant he said i have often thought what a solemn thing it would be could we have brought to our mind at once all the scenes of distress and misery which any spot however beautiful and calm before us has been witness to since the beginning <\s>
<s> that water break with the glassy quiet pool beneath it that looks so lovely and presents no images to the mind but of peace there i remember the only son of his father a poor man who lived yonder was drowned this walk and conversation took place in october 1836 <\s>
<s> if any one is surprised that wordsworth supposing him to have been then looking into the very dell on which he wrote the above poem in 1800 did not name it to mr <\s>
<s> coleridge he must remember that he was not in the habit of speaking of the places he had memorialised in verse and that in 1836 his sister emmeline had for a year been a confirmed invalid at rydal <\s>
<s> i have repeatedly followed easdale beck all the way up from its junction with the rothay to the tarn and found no spot corresponding so closely to the realistic detail of this poem as the one suggested by dr <\s>
<s> there are two places further up the dale where the sallies of glad sound such as are referred to in the poem are even more distinctly audible but they are not at a sudden turning as is the spot above goody bridge <\s>

<s> tis of the elder brother i am speaking 305 they had an uncle he was at that time a thriving man and trafficked on the seas and but for that 37 same uncle to this hour leonard had never handled rope or shroud for the boy loved the life which we lead here 310 and though of unripe years a stripling only 38 his soul was knit to this his native soil <\s>
<s> but as i said old walter was too weak to strive with such a torrent when he died the estate and house were sold and all their sheep 315 a pretty flock and which for aught i know had clothed the ewbanks for a thousand years well all was gone and they were destitute and leonard chiefly for his brother's sake resolved to try his fortune on the seas <\s>

<s> this is sad talk they'll never sound for him living or dead when last we heard of him 330 he was in slavery among the moors upon the barbary coast twas not a little that would bring down his spirit and no doubt before it ended in his death the youth 42 was sadly crossed poor leonard <\s>
<s> when we parted 335 he took me by the hand and said to me if e'er he should grow rich he would return to live in peace upon his father's land and lay his bones among us <\s>
<s> if that day 340 should come twould needs be a glad day for him he would himself no doubt be happy then as any that should meet him priest <\s>
<s> you said his kindred all were in their graves 345 and that he had one brother priest <\s>
<s> that is but a fellow tale of sorrow <\s>
<s> from his youth james though not sickly yet was delicate and leonard being always by his side 350 had done so many offices about him that though he was not of a timid nature yet still the spirit of a mountain boy in him was somewhat checked and when his brother was gone to sea and he was left alone 355 the little colour that he had was soon stolen from his cheek he drooped and pined and pined leonard <\s>
<s> but these are all the graves of full grown men <\s>
<s> ay sir that passed away we took him to us he was the child of all the dale he lived 360 three months with one and six months with another and wanted neither food nor clothes nor love and many many happy days were his <\s>
<s> but whether blithe or sad tis my belief his absent brother still was at his heart <\s>
<s> and when he dwelt 44 beneath our roof we found a practice till this time unknown to him that often rising from his bed at night he in his sleep would walk about and sleeping he sought his brother leonard you are moved <\s>
<s> forgive me sir before i spoke to you i judged you most unkindly <\s>
<s> but this youth how did he die at last <\s>
<s> one sweet may morning 375 it will be twelve years since when spring returns he had gone forth among the new dropped lambs with two or three companions whom their course of occupation led from height to height under a cloudless sun till he at length 380 through weariness or haply to indulge the humour of the moment lagged behind <\s>
<s> you see yon precipice it wears the shape of a vast building made of many crags 46 and in the midst is one particular rock 385 that rises like a column from the vale whence by our shepherds it is called the pillar <\s>
<s> upon its a√´ry summit crowned with heath the loiterer not unnoticed by his comrades lay stretched at ease but passing by the place 390 on their return they found that he was gone <\s>
<s> no ill was feared till one of them by chance entering when evening was far spent the house which at that time was james's home there learned 47 that nobody had seen him all that day h 395 the morning came and still he was unheard of the neighbours were alarmed and to the brook some hastened some ran to the lake 48 ere noon they found him at the foot of that same rock dead and with mangled limbs <\s>
<s> the third day after 400 i buried him poor youth 49 and there he lies <\s>
<s> and that then is his grave before his death you say 50 that he saw many happy years <\s>
<s> ay that he did leonard <\s>
<s> and all went well with him 405 priest <\s>
<s> if he had one the youth 51 had twenty homes <\s>
<s> and you believe then that his mind was easy priest <\s>
<s> yes long before he died he found that time is a true friend to sorrow and unless his thoughts were turned on leonard's luckless fortune 410 he talked about him with a cheerful love <\s>
<s> he could not come to an unhallowed end <\s>
<s> nay god forbid you recollect i mentioned a habit which disquietude and grief had brought upon him and we all conjectured 415 that as the day was warm he had lain down on the soft heath 52 and waiting for his comrades he there had fallen asleep that in his sleep he to the margin of the precipice had walked and from the summit had fallen headlong 420 and so no doubt he perished <\s>
<s> when the youth fell in his hand he must have grasp'd we think 53 his shepherd's staff for on that pillar of rock it had been caught mid way and there for years 54 it hung and mouldered there <\s>
<s> the priest here ended the stranger would have thanked him but he felt a gushing from his heart that took away the power of speech <\s>
<s> both left the spot in silence 55 and leonard when they reached the church yard gate 430 as the priest lifted up the latch turned round and looking at the grave he said my brother <\s>
<s> the vicar did not hear the words and now he pointed towards his dwelling place entreating 56 that leonard would partake his homely fare 435 the other thanked him with an earnest 57 voice but added that the evening being calm he would pursue his journey <\s>
<s> it was not long ere leonard reached a grove that overhung the road he there stopped short 440 and sitting down beneath the trees reviewed all that the priest had said his early years were with him his long absence cherished hopes 58 and thoughts which had been his an hour before all pressed on him with such a weight that now 445 this vale where he had been so happy seemed a place in which he could not bear to live so he relinquished all his purposes <\s>
<s> he travelled back 59 to egremont and thence that night he wrote a letter to the priest 60 450 reminding him of what had passed between them and adding with a hope to be forgiven that it was from the weakness of his heart he had not dared to tell him who he was <\s>

<s> of biographia literaria vol <\s>
<s> of the edition of 1817 ed this poem illustrates the way in which wordsworth's imagination worked upon a minimum of fact idealizing a simple story and adding the gleam the light that never was on sea or land the consecration and the poet's dream <\s>
<s> it is the only poem of his referring to ennerdale but perhaps the chief association with that dale to those who visit it after becoming acquainted with this poem will be the fact that the brothers ewbank were supposed to have spent their youth under the shadow of the pillar and leonard to have had this conversation on his return from sea with the venerable priest of ennerdale <\s>
<s> the district is described with all that local accuracy which wordsworth invariably showed in idealization <\s>
<s> the height whence james ewbank is supposed to have fallen is not the pillar rock a crag somewhat difficult to ascend except by practised climbers and which has only been accessible since mountaineering became an art and a passion to englishmen <\s>
<s> but if we suppose the conversation with the priest of ennerdale to have taken place at the bridge below the lake as that is the only place where there is both a hamlet and a churchyard the precipice will refer to the pillar mountain <\s>
<s> both are alluded to in the poem <\s>
<s> the lines you see yon precipice it wears the shape of a vast building made of many crags and in the midst is one particular rock that rises like a column from the vale whence by our shepherds it is called the pillar are definite enough <\s>
<s> the great mass of the pillar mountain is first referred to and then the rock which is a characteristic spur halfway up the mountain on its northern side <\s>
<s> the a√´ry summit crowned with heath however on which the loiterer lay stretched at ease could neither be the top of this rock nor the summit of the mountain not the former because there is no heath on it and it would be impossible for a weary man loitering behind his companions to ascend it to rest not the latter because no one resting on the summit of the mountain could be not unnoticed by his comrades and they would not pass that way over the top of the mountain on their return to ennerdale <\s>
<s> this is an instance therefore in which precise localization is impossible <\s>
<s> probably wordsworth did not know either that the pillar rock was bare on the summit or that it had never been ascended in 1800 and he idealised it to suit his imaginative purpose <\s>

<s> it was the first of those domestic tales that spake to me 5 of shepherds dwellers in the valleys men whom i already loved not verily for their own sakes but for the fields and hills 25 where was their occupation and abode <\s>
<s> and hence this tale while i was yet a boy careless of books yet having felt the power of nature by the gentle agency of natural objects led me on to feel 30 for passions that were not my own and think at random and imperfectly indeed on man the heart of man and human life <\s>

<s> upon the forest side in grasmere vale 40 there dwelt a shepherd michael was his name an old man stout of heart and strong of limb <\s>
<s> his bodily frame had been from youth to age of an unusual strength his mind was keen intense and frugal apt for all affairs 45 and in his shepherd's calling he was prompt and watchful more than ordinary men <\s>
<s> hence had he learned 6 the meaning of all winds of blasts of every tone and oftentimes when others heeded not he heard the south 50 make subterraneous music like the noise of bagpipers on distant highland hills <\s>
<s> the shepherd at such warning of his flock bethought him and he to himself would say the winds are now devising work for me <\s>
<s> and truly at all times the storm that drives the traveller to a shelter summoned him up to the mountains he had been alone amid the heart of many thousand mists that came to him and left him on the heights <\s>
<s> so lived he till his eightieth year was past <\s>
<s> and grossly that man errs who should suppose that the green valleys and the streams and rocks were things indifferent to the shepherd's thoughts <\s>
<s> fields where with cheerful spirits he had breathed 65 the common air hills which with vigorous step he had so often climbed 7 which had impressed so many incidents upon his mind of hardship skill or courage joy or fear which like a book preserved the memory 70 of the dumb animals whom he had saved had fed or sheltered linking to such acts the certainty of honourable gain those fields those hills what could they less <\s>
<s> had laid [8 strong hold on his affections were to him 75 a pleasurable feeling of blind love the pleasure which there is in life itself <\s>
<s> his days had not been passed in singleness <\s>
<s> his helpmate was a comely matron old 9 though younger than himself full twenty years <\s>
<s> she was a woman of a stirring life whose heart was in her house two wheels she had of antique form this large for spinning wool that small for flax and if one wheel had rest it was because the other was at work <\s>
<s> the pair had but one inmate in their house an only child who had been born to them when michael telling o'er his years began to deem that he was old in shepherd's phrase with one foot in the grave <\s>
<s> this only son 90 with two brave sheep dogs tried in many a storm the one of an inestimable worth made all their household <\s>
<s> i may truly say that they were as a proverb in the vale for endless industry <\s>
<s> when day was gone 95 and from their occupations out of doors the son and father were come home even then their labour did not cease unless when all turned to the 10 cleanly supper board and there each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk 100 sat round the 11 basket piled with oaten cakes and their plain home made cheese <\s>
<s> yet when the 12 meal was ended luke for so the son was named and his old father both betook themselves to such convenient work as might employ 105 their hands by the fire side perhaps to card wool for the housewife's spindle or repair some injury done to sickle flail or scythe or other implement of house or field <\s>
<s> down from the ceiling by the chimney's edge 110 that 13 in our ancient uncouth country style with huge and black projection overbrowed 14 large space beneath as duly as the light of day grew dim the housewife hung a lamp an aged utensil which had performed 115 service beyond all others of its kind <\s>
<s> early at evening did it burn and late surviving comrade of uncounted hours which going by from year to year had found and left the couple neither gay perhaps 120 nor cheerful yet with objects and with hopes living a life of eager industry <\s>
<s> and now when luke had reached his 15 eighteenth year there by the light of this old lamp they sate father and son while far 16 into the night 125 the housewife plied her own peculiar work making the cottage through the silent hours murmur as with the sound of summer flies <\s>
<s> b 17 this 18 light was famous in its neighbourhood and was a public symbol of the life 130 that 19 thrifty pair had lived <\s>
<s> for as it chanced their cottage on a plot of rising ground stood single with large prospect north and south high into easedale up to dunmail raise and westward to the village near the lake 135 and from this constant light so regular and so far seen the house itself by all who dwelt within the limits of the vale both old and young was named the evening star <\s>
<s> thus living on through such a length of years 140 the shepherd if he loved himself must needs have loved his helpmate but to michael's heart this son of his old age was yet more dear less from instinctive tenderness 20 the same fond spirit that blindly works in the blood of all 21 145 than 22 that a child more than all other gifts that earth can offer to declining man 23 brings hope with it and forward looking thoughts and stirrings of inquietude when they by tendency of nature needs must fail <\s>
<s> 24 exceeding was the love he bare to him his heart and his heart's joy <\s>
<s> for oftentimes old michael while he was a babe in arms had done him female service not alone for pastime 25 and delight as is the use 155 of fathers but with patient mind enforced to acts of tenderness and he had rocked his cradle as with a woman's gentle hand <\s>
<s> and in a later time ere yet the boy had put on boy's attire did michael love 160 albeit of a stern unbending mind to have the young one in his sight when he wrought in the field or on his shepherd's stool sate with a fettered sheep before him stretched under the large old oak that near his door 165 stood single and from matchless depth of shade 27 chosen for the shearer's covert from the sun thence in our rustic dialect was called the clipping tree c a name which yet it bears <\s>
<s> there while they two were sitting in the shade 170 with others round them earnest all and blithe would michael exercise his heart with looks of fond correction and reproof bestowed upon the child if he disturbed the sheep by catching at their legs or with his shouts 175 scared them while they lay still beneath the shears <\s>
<s> and when by heaven's good grace the boy grew up a healthy lad and carried in his cheek two steady roses that were five years old then michael from a winter coppice cut 180 with his own hand a sapling which he hooped with iron making it throughout in all due requisites a perfect shepherd's staff and gave it to the boy wherewith equipt he as a watchman oftentimes was placed 185 at gate or gap to stem or turn the flock and to his office prematurely called there stood the urchin as you will divine something between a hindrance and a help and for this cause not always i believe 190 receiving from his father hire of praise though nought was left undone which staff or voice or looks or threatening gestures could perform <\s>
<s> but soon as luke full ten years old could stand against the mountain blasts and to the heights 200 not fearing toil nor length of weary ways he with his father daily went and they were as companions why should i relate that objects which the shepherd loved before were dearer now <\s>
<s> that from the boy there came 205 feelings and emanations things which were light to the sun and music to the wind and that the old man's heart seemed born again <\s>
<s> thus in his father's sight the boy grew up and now when he had reached his eighteenth year 210 he was his comfort and his daily hope <\s>
<s> d while in this sort the simple household lived 28 from day to day to michael's ear there came distressful tidings <\s>
<s> long before the time of which i speak the shepherd had been bound 215 in surety for his brother's son a man of an industrious life and ample means but unforeseen misfortunes suddenly had prest upon him and old michael now was summoned to discharge the forfeiture 220 a grievous penalty but little less than half his substance <\s>
<s> this unlooked for claim at the first hearing for a moment took more hope out of his life than he supposed that any old man ever could have lost <\s>
<s> as soon as he had armed himself with strength to look his trouble in the face it seemed the shepherd's sole resource to sell at once 29 a portion of his patrimonial fields <\s>
<s> such was his first resolve he thought again 230 and his heart failed him <\s>
<s> isabel said he two evenings after he had heard the news i have been toiling more than seventy years and in the open sunshine of god's love have we all lived yet if these fields of ours 235 should pass into a stranger's hand i think that i could not lie quiet in my grave <\s>
<s> our lot is a hard lot the sun himself 30 has scarcely been more diligent than i and i have lived to be a fool at last 240 to my own family <\s>
<s> an evil man that was and made an evil choice if he were false to us and if he were not false there are ten thousand to whom loss like this had been no sorrow <\s>
<s> i forgive him but 245 twere better to be dumb than to talk thus <\s>
<s> when i began my purpose was to speak of remedies and of a cheerful hope <\s>
<s> our luke shall leave us isabel the land shall not go from us and it shall be free 250 he shall possess it free as is the wind that passes over it <\s>
<s> we have thou know'st another kinsman he will be our friend in this distress <\s>
<s> he is a prosperous man thriving in trade and luke to him shall go 255 and with his kinsman's help and his own thrift he quickly will repair this loss and then he may return to us <\s>
<s> if here he stay what can be done <\s>
<s> where every one is poor what can be gained <\s>
<s> at this the old man paused and isabel sat silent for her mind was busy looking back into past times <\s>
<s> there's richard bateman thought she to herself e he was a parish boy at the church door 265 they made a gathering for him shillings pence and halfpennies wherewith the neighbours bought a basket which they filled with pedlar's wares and with this basket on his arm the lad went up to london found a master there 270 who out of many chose the trusty boy to go and overlook his merchandise beyond the seas where he grew wondrous rich and left estates and monies to the poor and at his birth place built a chapel floored 275 with marble which he sent from foreign lands <\s>
<s> these thoughts and many others of like sort passed quickly through the mind of isabel and her face brightened <\s>
<s> the old man was glad and thus resumed well isabel <\s>
<s> this scheme 280 these two days has been meat and drink to me <\s>
<s> far more than we have lost is left us yet <\s>
<s> we have enough i wish indeed that i were younger but this hope is a good hope <\s>
<s> make ready luke's best garments of the best 285 buy for him more and let us send him forth to morrow or the next day or to night if he could 32 go the boy should go to night <\s>
<s> here michael ceased and to the fields went forth with a light heart <\s>
<s> f the housewife for five days 290 was restless morn and night and all day long wrought on with her best fingers to prepare things needful for the journey of her son <\s>
<s> but isabel was glad when sunday came to stop her in her work for when she lay 295 by michael's side she through the last two nights 33 heard him how he was troubled in his sleep and when they rose at morning she could see that all his hopes were gone <\s>
<s> that day at noon she said to luke while they two by themselves 300 were sitting at the door thou must not go we have no other child but thee to lose none to remember do not go away for if thou leave thy father he will die <\s>
<s> the youth 34 made answer with a jocund voice 305 and isabel when she had told her fears recovered heart <\s>
<s> that evening her best fare did she bring forth and all together sat like happy people round a christmas fire <\s>
<s> with daylight 35 isabel resumed her work 310 and all the ensuing week the house appeared as cheerful as a grove in spring at length the expected letter from their kinsman came with kind assurances that he would do his utmost for the welfare of the boy 315 to which requests were added that forthwith he might be sent to him <\s>
<s> ten times or more the letter was read over isabel went forth to show it to the neighbours round nor was there at that time on english land 320 a prouder heart than luke's <\s>
<s> when isabel had to her house returned the old man said he shall depart to morrow <\s>
<s> to this word the housewife answered talking much of things which if at such short notice he should go 325 would surely be forgotten <\s>
<s> but at length she gave consent and michael was at ease <\s>
<s> near the tumultuous brook of green head ghyll in that deep valley michael had designed to build a sheep fold g and before he heard 330 the tidings of his melancholy loss for this same purpose he had gathered up a heap of stones which by the streamlet's edge 36 lay thrown together ready for the work <\s>
<s> with luke that evening thitherward he walked 335 and soon as they had reached the place he stopped and thus the old man spake to him my son to morrow thou wilt leave me with full heart i look upon thee for thou art the same that wert a promise to me ere thy birth 340 and all thy life hast been my daily joy <\s>
<s> i will relate to thee some little part of our two histories twill do thee good when thou art from me even if i should touch on things 37 thou canst not know of after thou 345 first cam'st into the world as oft befals 38 to new born infants thou didst sleep away two days and blessings from thy father's tongue then fell upon thee <\s>
<s> day by day passed on and still i loved thee with increasing love <\s>
<s> never to living ear came sweeter sounds than when i heard thee by our own fire side first uttering without words a natural tune while 39 thou a feeding babe didst in thy joy sing at thy mother's breast <\s>
<s> month followed month 355 and in the open fields my life was passed and on 40 the mountains else i think that thou hadst been brought up upon thy father's knees <\s>
<s> but we were playmates luke among these hills as well thou knowest in us the old and young 360 have played together nor with me didst thou lack any pleasure which a boy can know <\s>
<s> luke had a manly heart but at these words he sobbed aloud <\s>
<s> the old man grasped his hand and said nay do not take it so i see 365 that these are things of which i need not speak <\s>
<s> even to the utmost i have been to thee a kind and a good father and herein i but repay a gift which i myself received at others hands for though now old 370 beyond the common life of man i still remember them who loved me in my youth <\s>
<s> both of them sleep together here they lived as all their forefathers had done and when at length their time was come they were not loth 375 to give their bodies to the family mould <\s>
<s> i wished that thou should'st live the life they lived but tis a long time to look back my son and see so little gain from threescore years <\s>
<s> these fields were burthened when they came to me 380 till i was forty years of age not more than half of my inheritance was mine <\s>
<s> i toiled and toiled god blessed me in my work and till these three weeks past the land was free <\s>
<s> it looks as if it never could endure 385 another master <\s>
<s> heaven forgive me luke if i judge ill for thee but it seems good that thou should'st go at this the old man paused then pointing to the stones near which they stood 390 thus after a short silence he resumed this was a work for us and now my son it is a work for me <\s>
<s> but lay one stone here lay it for me luke with thine own hands <\s>
<s> nay boy be of good hope we both may live 395 to see a better day <\s>
<s> at eighty four i still am strong and hale 43 ]; do thou thy part i will do mine i will begin again with many tasks that were resigned to thee up to the heights and in among the storms 400 will i without thee go again and do all works which i was wont to do alone before i knew thy face heaven bless thee boy <\s>
<s> thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast with many hopes it should be so yes yes 405 i knew that thou could'st never have a wish to leave me luke thou hast been bound to me only by links of love when thou art gone what will be left to us but i forget my purposes <\s>
<s> lay now the corner stone 410 as i requested and hereafter luke when thou art gone away should evil men be thy companions think of me my son and of this moment hither turn thy thoughts and god will strengthen thee amid all fear 415 and all temptation luke i pray that thou may'st bear in mind the life thy fathers lived 44 who being innocent did for that cause bestir them in good deeds <\s>
<s> now fare thee well when thou return'st thou in this place wilt see 420 a work which is not here a covenant twill be between us but whatever fate befal thee i shall love thee to the last and bear thy memory with me to the grave <\s>
<s> the shepherd ended here and luke stooped down 425 and as his father had requested laid the first stone of the sheep fold <\s>
<s> at the sight the old man's grief broke from him to his heart he pressed his son he kiss√®d him and wept and to the house together they returned <\s>
<s> hushed was that house in peace or seeming peace 45 ere the night fell with morrow's dawn the boy 46 began his journey and when he had reached the public way he put on a bold face and all the neighbours as he passed their doors 435 came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers that followed him till he was out of sight <\s>
<s> a good report did from their kinsman come of luke and his well doing and the boy wrote loving letters full of wondrous news 440 which as the housewife phrased it were throughout the prettiest letters that were ever seen <\s>

<s> the following is part of a letter written by wordsworth to charles james fox in 1802 and sent with a copy of lyrical ballads in the two poems the brothers and michael i have attempted to draw a picture of the domestic affections as i know they exist amongst a class of men who are now almost confined to the north of england <\s>
<s> they are small independent proprietors of land here called statesmen men of respectable education who daily labour on their own little properties <\s>
<s> the domestic affections will always be strong amongst men who live in a country not crowded with population if these men are placed above poverty <\s>
<s> but if they are proprietors of small estates which have descended to them from their ancestors the power which these affections will acquire amongst such men is inconceivable by those who have only had an opportunity of observing hired labourers farmers and the manufacturing poor <\s>
<s> their little tract of land serves as a kind of permanent rallying point for their domestic feelings as a tablet on which they are written which makes them objects of memory in a thousand instances when they would otherwise be forgotten <\s>
<s> it is a fountain fitted to the nature of social man from which supplies of affection as pure as his heart was intended for are daily drawn <\s>
<s> this class of men is rapidly disappearing .... <\s>

<s> pectus enim est quod disertos facit et vis mentis <\s>
<s> ideoque imperitis quoque si modo sint aliquo affectu concitati verba non desunt <\s>
<s> the poems are faithful copies from nature and i hope whatever effect they may have upon you you will at least be able to perceive that they may excite profitable sympathies in many kind and good hearts and may in some small degree enlarge our feelings of reverence for our species and our knowledge of human nature by showing that our best qualities are possessed by men whom we are too apt to consider not with reference to the points in which they resemble us but to those in which they manifestly differ from us <\s>

<s> it is written as you know in the couplet measure and therefore i have nothing to say upon its metre but in respect to the poems in stanza neither in the prioress tale nor in the cuckoo and nightingale have i kept to the rule of the original as to the form and number and position of the rhymes thinking it enough if i kept the same number of lines in each stanza and this is i think all that is necessary and all that can be done without sacrificing the substance of sense too often to the mere form of sound <\s>

<s> i have myself heard wordsworth speak of his prolonged exhausting wanderings among the hills <\s>
<s> then miss fenwick's notes show that coleridge is certainly one of the two personages of the poem and there are points in the description of the second man which suit him very well <\s>

<s> their author therefore has rightly imparted to them the curiously blended flavour of romantic melancholy and slippered mirth of dreamlike vagueness and smiling hyperbole which forms the distinctive mark of thomson's poem and thus the poet and the philosopher friend of wordsworth's stanzas like thomson's companion sketches of the splenetic solitary the bard more fat than bard beseems and the little round fat oily man of god are neither more nor less than gentle caricatures <\s>
<s> it has been suggested by coleridge's grandson that wordsworth was describing s <\s>
<s> in all the stanzas of this poem that he drew two separate pictures of him in the first four stanzas a realistic character portrait and in the last four a companion picture figuring the outward semblance of coleridge but embodying characteristics drawn from a third person so that we have a fancy sketch mixed up with a real one <\s>
<s> i cannot agree with this <\s>

<s> his trade was to gather leeches but now leeches were scarce and he had not strength for it <\s>
<s> he lived by begging and was making his way to carlisle where he would buy a few books to sell <\s>
<s> he said leeches were very scarce partly owing to this dry season but many years they had been scarce <\s>

<s> as he tells us that he met the leech gatherer a few hundred yards from dove cottage the lonely place with its pool bare to the eye of heaven at once suggests white moss common and its small tarn but he adds that in the opening stanzas of the poem he is describing a state of feeling he was in when crossing the fells at the foot of ullswater to askam and that the image of the hare running races in her mirth with the glittering mist accompanying her was observed by him not on white moss common but in one of the ridges of moor divock <\s>

<s> i there was a roaring in the wind all night the rain came heavily and fell in floods but now the sun is rising calm and bright the birds are singing in the distant woods over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods 5 the jay makes answer as the magpie chatters and all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters <\s>
<s> ii all things that love the sun are out of doors the sky rejoices in the morning's birth the grass is bright with rain drops on the moors 10 the hare is running races in her mirth and with her feet she from the plashy earth raises a mist that 1 glittering in the sun runs with her all the way wherever she doth run <\s>
<s> iii i was a traveller then upon the moor 15 i saw the hare that raced about with joy i heard the woods and distant waters roar or heard them not as happy as a boy the pleasant season did my heart employ my old remembrances went from me wholly 20 and all the ways of men so vain and melancholy <\s>
<s> iv but as it sometimes chanceth from the might of joy in minds that can no further go as high as we have mounted in delight in our dejection do we sink as low 25 to me that morning did it happen so and fears and fancies thick upon me came dim sadness and blind thoughts i knew not nor could name <\s>
<s> v i heard the sky lark warbling 2 in the sky and i bethought me of the playful hare 30 even such a happy child of earth am i even as these blissful 3 creatures do i fare far from the world i walk and from all care but there may come another day to me solitude pain of heart distress and poverty <\s>
<s> vi my whole life i have lived in pleasant thought as if life's business were a summer mood as if all needful things would come unsought to genial faith still rich in genial good 4 but how can he expect that others should 40 build for him sow for him and at his call love him who for himself will take no heed at all <\s>
<s> a vii i thought of chatterton the marvellous boy the sleepless soul that perished in his pride 5 of him who walked in glory and in joy 45 following his plough along the mountain side 6 by our own spirits are we deified we poets in our youth begin in gladness but thereof come 7 in the end despondency and madness <\s>
<s> viii now whether it were [8 by peculiar grace 50 a leading from above a something given yet it befel that in this 9 lonely place when i with these untoward thoughts had striven beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven 10 i saw 11 a man before me unawares 55 the oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs <\s>
<s> ix as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who 13 do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence 60 so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth that 14 on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun itself x such seemed this man not all alive nor dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age 65 his body was bent double feet and head coming together in life's pilgrimage 15 as if some dire constraint of pain or rage of sickness felt by him in times long past a more than human weight upon his frame 16 had cast <\s>
<s> xi himself he propped limbs body and pale face 17 upon a long grey staff of shaven wood and still as i drew near with gentle pace upon the margin of that moorish flood 18 motionless as a cloud the old man stood 75 that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth all together if it move 19 at all <\s>
<s> xii at length himself unsettling he the pond stirred with his staff and fixedly did look upon the muddy water which he conned 80 as if he had been reading in a book and now a stranger's privilege i took 21 and drawing to his side to him did say this morning gives us promise of a glorious day <\s>
<s> xiii a gentle answer did the old man make 85 in courteous speech which forth he slowly drew and him with further words i thus bespake what occupation do you there pursue <\s>
<s> this is a lonesome place for one like 23 you <\s>
<s> ere he replied a flash of mild surprise 90 broke from the sable orbs of his yet vivid eyes <\s>
<s> b xiv his words came feebly from a feeble chest but 25 each in solemn order followed each with something of a lofty 26 utterance drest choice word 27 and measured phrase above 27 the reach 95 of ordinary men a stately speech such as grave livers do in scotland use religious men who give to god and man their dues <\s>
<s> xv he told that to these waters he had come 28 to gather leeches being old and poor 100 employment hazardous and wearisome <\s>
<s> and he had many hardships to endure 29 from pond to pond he roamed from moor to moor housing with god's good help by choice or chance and in this way he gained an honest maintenance <\s>
<s> xvi the old man still stood talking by my side but now 30 his voice to me was like a stream scarce heard nor word from word could i divide and the whole body of the man did seem like one whom i had met with in a dream 110 or like a man from some far region sent to give me human strength by apt admonishment <\s>
<s> xvii my former thoughts returned the fear that kills and 32 hope that is unwilling to be fed cold pain and labour and all fleshly ills 115 and mighty poets in their misery dead <\s>
<s> perplexed and longing to be comforted 33 my question eagerly did i renew how is it that you live and what is it you do <\s>
<s> xviii he with a smile did then his words repeat 120 and said that gathering leeches far and wide he travelled stirring thus about his feet the waters of the pools where they abide <\s>
<s> once i could meet with them on every side but they have dwindled long by slow decay 125 yet still i persevere and find them where i may <\s>
<s> xix while he was talking thus the lonely place the old man's shape and speech all troubled me in my mind's eye i seemed to see him pace about the weary moors continually 130 wandering about alone and silently <\s>
<s> while i these thoughts within myself pursued he having made a pause the same discourse renewed <\s>
<s> xx and soon 37 with this he other matter blended cheerfully uttered with demeanour kind 135 but stately in the main and when he ended 38 i could have laughed myself to scorn to find in that decrepit man so firm a mind <\s>

<s> those smiles to earth unknown had then ceased for ever <\s>
<s> the reason why wordsworth erased so delightful and wonderful a stanza is to me only explicable on the supposition that it was his sister he referred to she who had accompanied him in former days in so many of his long walks in the country <\s>
<s> his wife never did this she had not the physical strength to do it and if she had been the person referred to wordsworth would hardly in 1845 have erased such a description of her as occurs in the stanza written in 1802 when she was still so vigorous <\s>
<s> besides mary wordsworth was in no sense a child of nature as dorothy was while the testimony of the wordsworth household is explicit that it was to his sister and not to his wife that the poet referred <\s>

<s> beside a lake their cottage stood not small like ours a peaceful flood but one of mighty size and strange that rough or smooth is full of change and stirring in its bed <\s>

<s> and quickly with a silent crew a boat is ready to pursue and from the shore their course they take and swiftly down the running lake they follow the blind boy <\s>
<s> but soon they move with softer pace so have ye seen the fowler chase on grasmere's clear unruffled breast a youngling of the wild duck's nest with deftly lifted oar 190 or as the wily sailors crept to seize while on the deep it slept the hapless creature which did dwell erewhile within the dancing shell they steal upon their prey <\s>
