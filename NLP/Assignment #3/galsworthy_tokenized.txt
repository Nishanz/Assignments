<s> wheeler brisk person enters with a dust pan and mrs <\s>
<s> jones more slowly with a scuttle <\s>
<s> drawing the curtains that precious husband of yours was round for you after you'd gone yesterday mrs <\s>
<s> wanted your money for drink i suppose <\s>
<s> he hangs about the corner here half the time <\s>
<s> i saw him outside the goat and bells when i went to the post last night <\s>
<s> if i were you i would n't live with him <\s>
<s> i would n't live with a man that raised his hand to me <\s>
<s> i wouldn't put up with it <\s>
<s> why don't you take your children and leave him <\s>
<s> if you put up with im it'll only make him worse <\s>
<s> i never can see why because a man's married you he should knock you about <\s>
<s> slim dark eyed and dark haired oval faced and with a smooth soft even voice her manner patient her way of talking quite impersonal she wears a blue linen dress and boots with holes it was nearly two last night before he come home and he wasn't himself <\s>
<s> he made me get up and he knocked me about he didn't seem to know what he was saying or doing <\s>
<s> of course i would leave him but i'm really afraid of what he'd do to me <\s>
<s> he s such a violent man when he's not himself <\s>
<s> why don't you get him locked up <\s>
<s> you'll never have any peace until you get him locked up <\s>
<s> if i were you i'd go to the police court tomorrow <\s>
<s> that's what i would do <\s>
<s> of course i ought to go because he does treat me so badly when he's not himself <\s>
<s> but you see bettina he has a very hard time he s been out of work two months and it preys upon his mind <\s>
<s> when he's in work he behaves himself much better <\s>
<s> it's when he's out of work that he's so violent <\s>
<s> well if you won't take any steps you ll never get rid of him <\s>
<s> of course it's very wearing to me i don't get my sleep at nights <\s>
<s> and it s not as if i were getting help from him because i have to do for the children and all of us <\s>
<s> and he throws such dreadful things up at me talks of my having men to follow me about <\s>
<s> such a thing never happens no man ever speaks to me <\s>
<s> and of course it's just the other way <\s>
<s> it's what he does that's wrong and makes me so unhappy <\s>
<s> and then he s always threatenin to cut my throat if i leave him <\s>
<s> it's all the drink and things preying on his mind he s not a bad man really <\s>
<s> sometimes he'll speak quite kind to me but i've stood so much from him i don't feel it in me to speak kind back but just keep myself to myself <\s>
<s> and he's all right with the children too except when he's not himself <\s>
<s> you mean when he's drunk the beauty <\s>
<s> without change of voice there's the young gentleman asleep on the sofa <\s>
<s> they both look silently at jack mrs <\s>
<s> at last in her soft voice he does n't look quite himself <\s>
<s> he's a young limb that's what he is <\s>
<s> it s my belief he was tipsy last night like your husband <\s>
<s> it s another kind of bein out of work that sets him to drink <\s>
<s> i ll go and tell marlow <\s>
<s> this is his job <\s>
<s> jones upon her knees begins a gentle sweeping jack <\s>
<s> it's me sir mrs <\s>
<s> sitting up and looking round where is it what what time is it <\s>
<s> it's getting on for nine o'clock sir <\s>
<s> rising and loosening his tongue putting hands to his head and staring hard at mrs <\s>
<s> jones look here you mrs mrs <\s>
<s> jones don't you say you caught me asleep here <\s>
<s> no sir of course i won't sir <\s>
<s> it's quite an accident i don't know how it happened <\s>
<s> i must have forgotten to go to bed <\s>
<s> it's a queer thing <\s>
<s> i ve got a most beastly headache <\s>
<s> mind you don't say anything mrs <\s>
<s> goes out and passes marlow in the doorway <\s>
<s> marlow is young and quiet he is cleanshaven and his hair is brushed high from his forehead in a coxcomb <\s>
<s> incidentally a butler he is first a man <\s>
<s> he looks at mrs <\s>
<s> jones and smiles a private smile marlow <\s>
<s> not the first time and won't be the last <\s>
<s> looked a bit dicky eh mrs <\s>
<s> he did n't look quite himself <\s>
<s> of course i did n't take notice <\s>
<s> you're used to them <\s>
<s> how's your old man <\s>
<s> softly as throughout well he was very bad last night he did n't seem to know what he was about <\s>
<s> he was very late and he was most abusive <\s>
<s> but now of course he's asleep <\s>
<s> that's his way of finding a job eh <\s>
<s> as a rule mr <\s>
<s> marlow he goes out early every morning looking for work and sometimes he comes in fit to drop and of course i can't say he does n't try to get it because he does <\s>
<s> she stands quite still her fan and brush before her at the beginning and the end of long vistas of experience traversing them with her impersonal eye but he's not a good husband to me last night he hit me and he was so dreadfully abusive <\s>
<s> he s too fond of the goat and bells that's what's the matter with him <\s>
<s> i see him at the corner late every night <\s>
<s> he gets to feeling very low walking about all day after work and being refused so often and then when he gets a drop in him it goes to his head <\s>
<s> but he shouldn't treat his wife as he treats me <\s>
<s> sometimes i ve had to go and walk about at night when he wouldn't let me stay in the room but he's sorry for it afterwards <\s>
<s> and he hangs about after me he waits for me in the street and i don't think he ought to because i ve always been a good wife to him <\s>
<s> and i tell him mrs <\s>
<s> barthwick wouldn't like him coming about the place <\s>
<s> but that only makes him angry and he says dreadful things about the gentry <\s>
<s> of course it was through me that he first lost his place through his not treating me right and that's made him bitter against the gentry <\s>
<s> he had a very good place as groom in the country but it made such a stir because of course he did n't treat me right <\s>
<s> yes his employer said he couldn't keep him because there was a great deal of talk and he said it was such a bad example <\s>
<s> but it's very important for me to keep my work here i have the three children and i don't want him to come about after me in the streets and make a disturbance as he sometimes does <\s>
<s> holding up the empty decanter not a drain <\s>
<s> next time he hits you get a witness and go down to the court mrs <\s>
<s> yes i think i ve made up my mind <\s>
<s> i think i ought to <\s>
<s> he searches for the silver box he looks at mrs <\s>
<s> jones who is sweeping on her hands and knees he checks himself and stands reflecting <\s>
<s> from the tray he picks two half smoked cigarettes and reads the name on them nestor where the deuce <\s>
<s> with a meditative air he looks again at mrs <\s>
<s> jones and taking up jack's overcoat he searches in the pockets <\s>
<s> wheeler with a tray of breakfast things comes in marlow <\s>
<s> aside to wheeler have you seen the cigarette box <\s>
<s> i put it on the tray last night <\s>
<s> and he's been smoking <\s>
<s> showing her the ends of cigarettes it's not in these pockets <\s>
<s> he can't have taken it upstairs this morning <\s>
<s> have a good look in his room when he comes down <\s>
<s> who's been in here <\s>
<s> only me and mrs <\s>
<s> i ve finished here shall i do the drawing room now <\s>
<s> looking at her doubtfully have you seen  better do the boudwower first <\s>
<s> jones goes out with pan and brush <\s>
<s> marlow and wheeler look each other in the face marlow <\s>
<s> hesitating you don't think she nodding at the door marlow <\s>
<s> stoutly i don't  i never believes anything of anybody <\s>
<s> but the master'll have to be told <\s>
<s> you wait a bit and see if it don't turn up <\s>
<s> suspicion's no business of ours <\s>
<s> i set my mind against it <\s>
<s> the curtain rises again at once <\s>
<s> scene iii barthwick and mrs <\s>
<s> barthwick are seated at the breakfast table <\s>
<s> he is a man between fifty and sixty quietly important with a bald forehead and pince nez and the times in his hand <\s>
<s> she is a lady of nearly fifty well dressed with greyish hair good features and a decided manner <\s>
<s> they face each other <\s>
<s> from behind his paper the labour man has got in at the by election for barnside my dear <\s>
<s> i can't think what on earth the country is about <\s>
<s> it's not a matter of vast importance <\s>
<s> how can you take it so calmly john <\s>
<s> to me it's simply outrageous <\s>
<s> and there you sit you liberals and pretend to encourage these people <\s>
<s> frowning the representation of all parties is necessary for any proper reform for any proper social policy <\s>
<s> i've no patience with your talk of reform all that nonsense about social policy <\s>
<s> we know perfectly well what it is they want they want things for themselves <\s>
<s> those socialists and labour men are an absolutely selfish set of people <\s>
<s> they have no sense of patriotism like the upper classes they simply want what we've got <\s>
<s> want what we've got <\s>
<s> he stares into space my dear what are you talking about <\s>
<s> with a contortion i m no alarmist <\s>
<s> wait until they begin to tax our investments <\s>
<s> i m convinced that when they once get a chance they will tax everything they ve no feeling for the country <\s>
<s> you liberals and conservatives you re all alike you don't see an inch before your noses <\s>
<s> you've no imagination not a scrap of imagination between you <\s>
<s> you ought to join hands and nip it in the bud <\s>
<s> you re talking nonsense <\s>
<s> how is it possible for liberals and conservatives to join hands as you call it <\s>
<s> that shows how absurd it is for women  why the very essence of a liberal is to trust in the people <\s>
<s> now john eat your breakfast <\s>
<s> as if there were any real difference between you and the conservatives <\s>
<s> all the upper classes have the same interests to protect and the same principles <\s>
<s> you're sitting upon a volcano john <\s>
<s> i read a letter in the paper yesterday <\s>
<s> i forget the man's name but it made the whole thing perfectly clear <\s>
<s> you don't look things in the face <\s>
<s> heavily i am a liberal <\s>
<s> drop the subject please <\s>
<s> i quite agree with what this man says education is simply ruining the lower classes <\s>
<s> it unsettles them and that's the worst thing for us all <\s>
<s> i see an enormous difference in the manner of servants <\s>
<s> barthwick with suspicious emphasis i welcome any change that will lead to something better <\s>
<s> he opens a letter h'm <\s>
<s> this is that affair of master jack's again <\s>
<s> sir we have received mr <\s>
<s> john barthwick senior's draft for forty pounds <\s>
<s> the letter's to him <\s>
<s> we now enclose the cheque you cashed with us which as we stated in our previous letter was not met on presentation at your bank <\s>
<s> we are sir yours obediently moss and sons tailors <\s>
<s> staring at the cheque a pretty business altogether <\s>
<s> the boy might have been prosecuted <\s>
<s> come john you know jack did n't mean anything he only thought he was overdrawing <\s>
<s> i still think his bank ought to have cashed that cheque <\s>
<s> they must know your position <\s>
<s> replacing in the envelope the letter and the cheque much good that would have done him in a court of law <\s>
<s> he stops as jack comes in fastening his waistcoat and staunching a razor cut upon his chin jack <\s>
<s> sitting down between them and speaking with an artificial joviality sorry i m late <\s>
<s> he looks lugubriously at the dishes tea please mother <\s>
<s> any letters for me <\s>
<s> barthwick hands the letter to him but look here i say this has been opened <\s>
<s> i do wish you would n't barthwick <\s>
<s> touching the envelope i suppose i m entitled to this name <\s>
<s> sulkily well i can't help having your name father <\s>
<s> he reads the letter and mutters brutes <\s>
<s> eyeing him you don't deserve to be so well out of that <\s>
<s> haven't you ragged me enough dad <\s>
<s> yes john let jack have his breakfast <\s>
<s> if you hadn't had me to come to where would you have been <\s>
<s> it's the merest accident suppose you had been the son of a poor man or a clerk <\s>
<s> obtaining money with a cheque you knew your bank could not meet <\s>
<s> it might have ruined you for life <\s>
<s> i can't see what's to become of you if these are your principles <\s>
<s> i never did anything of the sort myself <\s>
<s> i expect you always had lots of money <\s>
<s> if you've got plenty of money of course barthwick <\s>
<s> on the contrary i had not your advantages <\s>
<s> my father kept me very short of money <\s>
<s> how much had you dad <\s>
<s> the question is do you feel the gravity of what you did <\s>
<s> i don't know about the gravity <\s>
<s> of course i m very sorry if you think it was wrong <\s>
<s> have n't i said so <\s>
<s> i should never have done it at all if i had n't been so jolly hard up <\s>
<s> how much of that forty pounds have you got left jack <\s>
<s> hesitating i don't know not much <\s>
<s> desperately i have n't got any <\s>
<s> i know i ve got the most beastly headache <\s>
<s> he leans his head on his hand mrs <\s>
<s> can't you eat any breakfast <\s>
<s> drawing in his breath too jolly bad <\s>
<s> come with me dear i'll give you something that will take it away at once <\s>
<s> they leave the room and barthwick tearing up the letter goes to the fireplace and puts the pieces in the fire <\s>
<s> while he is doing this marlow comes in and looking round him is about quietly to withdraw barthwick <\s>
<s> what d you want <\s>
<s> i was looking for mr <\s>
<s> what d you want mr <\s>
<s> with hesitation i thought i should find him here sir <\s>
<s> suspiciously yes but what do you want him for <\s>
<s> offhandedly there's a lady called asked to speak to him for a minute sir <\s>
<s> a lady at this time in the morning <\s>
<s> what sort of a lady <\s>
<s> without expression in his voice i can't tell sir no particular sort <\s>
<s> she might be after charity <\s>
<s> she might be a sister of mercy i should think sir <\s>
<s> is she dressed like one <\s>
<s> no sir she's in plain clothes sir <\s>
<s> did n't she say what she wanted <\s>
<s> where did you leave her <\s>
<s> in the hall sir <\s>
<s> how do you know she's not a thief not got designs on the house <\s>
<s> no sir i don't fancy so sir <\s>
<s> well show her in here i'll see her myself <\s>
<s> marlow goes out with a private gesture of dismay <\s>
<s> he soon returns ushering in a young pale lady with dark eyes and pretty figure in a modish black but rather shabby dress a black and white trimmed hat with a bunch of parma violets wrongly placed and fuzzy spotted veil <\s>
<s> at the sight of mr <\s>
<s> barthwick she exhibits every sign of nervousness <\s>
<s> marlow goes out unknown lady <\s>
<s> but i beg pardon there's some mistake i she turns to fly barthwick <\s>
<s> whom did you want to see madam <\s>
<s> stopping and looking back it was mr <\s>

<s> impulsively my reticule and all my money was in a crimson silk purse <\s>
<s> looking round for any chance to get away i don't know anything about it <\s>
<s> sharply come do you deny seeing this young lady last night <\s>
<s> whispering why did you give me away like this <\s>
<s> what on earth did you come here for <\s>
<s> tearfully i'm sure i didn't want to it's not likely is it <\s>
<s> you snatched it out of my hand you know you did and the purse had all my money in it <\s>

<s> none of the windows open <\s>
<s> quietly to jack you left your latch key in the door last night sir <\s>

<s> jones how long has she been working here <\s>
<s> only this last month sir <\s>
<s> what sort of person <\s>
<s> i don't know much about her sir seems a very quiet respectable woman <\s>

<s> barthwick and hey son come in barthwick <\s>
<s> well my dear you've not seen it i suppose <\s>
<s> but what an extraordinary thing john <\s>
<s> marlow of course is out of the question <\s>
<s> i m certain none of the maids as for cook <\s>
<s> it's perfectly detestable to me to suspect anybody <\s>
<s> it is not a question of one's feelings <\s>
<s> it's a question of justice <\s>
<s> i should n't be a bit surprised if the charwoman knew something about it <\s>
<s> it was laura who recommended her <\s>
<s> judicially i am going to have mrs <\s>
<s> leave it to me and er remember that nobody is guilty until they're proved so <\s>
<s> i shall be careful <\s>
<s> i have no intention of frightening her i shall give her every chance <\s>
<s> i hear she's in poor circumstances <\s>
<s> if we are not able to do much for them we are bound to have the greatest sympathy with the poor <\s>
<s> jones comes in pleasantly oh <\s>
<s> soft and even unemphatic good morning sir <\s>
<s> about your husband he's not in work i hear <\s>
<s> no sir of course he's not in work just now <\s>

<s> severely and what about their food when you're out at work <\s>
<s> well sir i have to give them their dinner to take with them <\s>
<s> of course i m not always able to give them anything sometimes i have to send them without but my husband is very good about the children when he's in work <\s>
<s> but when he's not in work of course he's a very difficult man <\s>
<s> he drinks i suppose <\s>
<s> of course i can't say he does n't drink because he does <\s>
<s> and i suppose he takes all your money <\s>
<s> no sir he's very good about my money except when he's not himself and then of course he treats me very badly <\s>
<s> now what is he your husband <\s>
<s> by profession sir of course he's a groom <\s>
<s> how came he to lose his place <\s>
<s> he lost his place a long time ago sir and he's never had a very long job since and now of course the motor cars are against him <\s>
<s> when were you married to him mrs <\s>
<s> eight years ago sir that was in mrs <\s>
<s> you said the eldest child was nine <\s>
<s> yes ma'am of course that was why he lost his place <\s>
<s> he did n't treat me rightly and of course his employer said he couldn't keep him because of the example <\s>
<s> you mean he ahem mrs <\s>
<s> yes sir and of course after he lost his place he married me <\s>
<s> you actually mean to say you you were barthwick <\s>
<s> hurriedly and where are you living now mrs <\s>

<s> well sir i have a day in stamford place thursdays <\s>

<s> i see four days a week and you get half a crown a day is that it <\s>
<s> yes sir and my dinner but sometimes it's only half a day and that's eighteen pence <\s>
<s> and when your husband earns anything he spends it in drink i suppose <\s>
<s> sometimes he does sir and sometimes he gives it to me for the children <\s>
<s> of course he would work if he could get it sir but it seems there are a great many people out of work <\s>
<s> we er won't go into that <\s>
<s> sympathetically and how about your work here <\s>
<s> do you find it hard <\s>
<s> no sir not very hard sir except of course when i don't get my sleep at night <\s>

<s> and sometimes i suppose you go out for cook <\s>
<s> and you ve been out this morning <\s>
<s> yes sir of course i had to go to the greengrocer's <\s>
<s> so your husband earns nothing <\s>
<s> and he's a bad character <\s>
<s> no sir i don't say that sir <\s>
<s> i think there's a great deal of good in him though he does treat me very bad sometimes <\s>
<s> and of course i don't like to leave him but i think i ought to because really i hardly know how to stay with him <\s>
<s> he often raises his hand to me <\s>
<s> not long ago he gave me a blow here touches her breast and i can feel it now <\s>
<s> so i think i ought to leave him don't you sir <\s>
<s> i can't help you there <\s>
<s> it's a very serious thing to leave your husband <\s>
<s> yes sir of course i m afraid of what he might do to me if i were to leave him he can be so very violent <\s>
<s> well that i can't pretend to say anything about <\s>
<s> it's the bad principle i'm speaking of mrs <\s>
<s> yes sir i know nobody can help me <\s>
<s> i know i must decide for myself and of course i know that he has a very hard life <\s>
<s> and he's fond of the children and its very hard for him to see them going without food <\s>
<s> hastily well er thank you i just wanted to hear about you <\s>
<s> i don't think i need detain you any longer mrs <\s>

<s> lady holyrood told me i had her up she said i said to her you'll leave my house at once i think your conduct disgraceful <\s>
<s> i can't tell i don't know and i don't wish to know what you were doing <\s>
<s> i send you away on principle you need not come to me for a character <\s>
<s> and the girl said if you don't give me my notice my lady i want a month's wages <\s>
<s> i've done nothing done nothing <\s>
<s> servants have too much license <\s>
<s> they hang together so terribly you never can tell what they're really thinking it's as if they were all in a conspiracy to keep you in the dark <\s>

<s> i feel sometimes i should like to shake him <\s>
<s> marlow's a most decent chap <\s>
<s> it's simply beastly every one knowing your affairs <\s>
<s> the less you say about that the better <\s>

<s> the woman impressed me most unfavourably <\s>
<s> she seemed to have no shame <\s>
<s> that affair she was talking about she and the man when they were young so immoral <\s>
<s> and before you and jack <\s>
<s> i could have put her out of the room <\s>
<s> i don't want to excuse them but in looking at these matters one must consider mrs <\s>
<s> perhaps you'll say the man's employer was wrong in dismissing him <\s>
<s> it's not there that i feel doubt <\s>
<s> what i ask myself is jack <\s>
<s> circulating the decanter in religious imitation of the rising and setting of the sun i ask myself whether we are sufficiently careful in making inquiries about people before we engage them especially as regards moral conduct <\s>
<s> pass the port please mother <\s>
<s> passing it my dear boy are n't you drinking too much <\s>
<s> jack fills his glass marlow <\s>
<s> entering detective snow to see you sir <\s>
<s> say i'll be with him in a minute <\s>
<s> without turning let him come in here marlow <\s>
<s> snow enters in an overcoat his bowler hat in hand barthwick <\s>
<s> good evening sir good evening ma'am <\s>
<s> i ve called round to report what i ve done rather late i m afraid another case took me away <\s>
<s> he takes the silver box out o f his pocket causing a sensation in the barthwick family this is the identical article i believe <\s>
<s> havin your crest and cypher as you described to me sir i d no hesitation in the matter <\s>
<s> will you have a glass of he glances at the waning port er sherry pours out sherry <\s>
<s> jack just give mr <\s>
<s> jack rises and gives the glass to snow then lolling in his chair regards him indolently snow <\s>
<s> drinking off wine and putting down the glass after seeing you i went round to this woman's lodgings sir <\s>
<s> it's a low neighborhood and i thought it as well to place a constable below and not without e was wanted as things turned out <\s>
<s> yes sir i ad some trouble <\s>
<s> i asked her to account for the presence of the article <\s>
<s> she could give me no answer except to deny the theft so i took her into custody then her husband came for me so i was obliged to take him too for assault <\s>
<s> he was very violent on the way to the station very violent threatened you and your son and altogether he was a handful i can till you <\s>
<s> what a ruffian he must be <\s>
<s> yes ma'am a rough customer <\s>
<s> sipping his mine bemused punch the beggar's head <\s>
<s> given to drink as i understand sir <\s>
<s> it's to be hoped he will get a severe punishment <\s>
<s> the odd thing is sir that he persists in sayin he took the box himself <\s>
<s> took the box himself <\s>
<s> he smiles what does he think to gain by that <\s>
<s> he says the young gentleman was intoxicated last night jack stops the cracking of a nut and looks at snow barthwick losing his smile has put his wine glass down there is a silence snow looking from face to face remarks took him into the house and gave him whisky and under the influence of an empty stomach the man says he took the box <\s>
<s> d you mean that he er intends to put this forward to morrow <\s>
<s> that'll be his line sir but whether he's endeavouring to shield his wife or whether he looks at jack there's something in it will be for the magistrate to say <\s>
<s> haughtily something in what <\s>
<s> i don't understand you <\s>
<s> as if my son would bring a man like that into the house <\s>
<s> from the fireplace with an effort to be calm my son can speak for himself no doubt <\s>
<s> well jack what do you say <\s>
<s> sharply what does he say <\s>
<s> why of course he says the whole story's stuff <\s>
<s> embarrassed well of course i of course i don't know anything about it <\s>
<s> i should think not indeed <\s>
<s> to snow the man is an audacious ruffian <\s>
<s> suppressing jumps but in view of my son's saying there's nothing in this this fable will it be necessary to proceed against the man under the circumstances <\s>
<s> we shall have to charge him with the assault sir <\s>
<s> it would be as well for your son to come down to the court <\s>
<s> there'll be a remand no doubt <\s>
<s> the queer thing is there was quite a sum of money found on him and a crimson silk purse <\s>
<s> barthwick starts jack rises and sits dozen again i suppose the lady has n't missed her purse <\s>
<s> to snow i ve been inquiring of the servants <\s>
<s> this man does hang about the house <\s>
<s> i shall feel much safer if he gets a good long sentence i do think we ought to be protected against such ruffians <\s>
<s> yes yes of course on principle but in this case we have a number of things to think of <\s>
<s> to snow i suppose as you say the man must be charged eh <\s>
<s> no question about that sir <\s>
<s> staring gloomily at jack this prosecution goes very much against the grain with me <\s>
<s> i have great sympathy with the poor <\s>
<s> in my position i m bound to recognise the distress there is amongst them <\s>
<s> the condition of the people leaves much to be desired <\s>
<s> d you follow me <\s>
<s> i wish i could see my way to drop it <\s>
<s> it's simply not fair to other people <\s>
<s> it's putting property at the mercy of any one who likes to take it <\s>
<s> trying to make signs to her aside i m not defending him not at all <\s>
<s> i'm trying to look at the matter broadly <\s>
<s> nonsense john there's a time for everything <\s>
<s> rather sardonically i might point out sir that to withdraw the charge of stealing would not make much difference because the facts must come out he looks significantly at jack in reference to the assault and as i said that charge will have to go forward <\s>
<s> it's entirely on the woman's account entirely a matter of my own private feelings <\s>
<s> if i were you sir i should let things take their course <\s>
<s> it's not likely there'll be much difficulty <\s>
<s> these things are very quick settled <\s>
<s> doubtfully you think so you think so <\s>
<s> rousing himself i say what shall i have to swear to <\s>
<s> that's best known to yourself sir <\s>
<s> retreating to the door better employ a solicitor sir in case anything should arise <\s>
<s> we shall have the butler to prove the loss of the article <\s>
<s> you'll excuse me going i m rather pressed to night <\s>
<s> the case may come on any time after eleven <\s>
<s> good evening sir good evening ma'am <\s>
<s> i shall have to produce the box in court to morrow so if you'll excuse me sir i may as well take it with me <\s>
<s> he takes the silver box and leaves them with a little bow barthwick makes a move to follow him then dashing his hands beneath his coat tails speaks with desperation barthwick <\s>

<s> and was he drunk <\s>
<s> yes your worship he was almost quite drunk <\s>

<s> yes yes but what did he say to you <\s>
<s> i asked him whatever came over him to do such a thing and he said it was the drink <\s>
<s> he said he had had too much to drink and something came over him <\s>
<s> and of course your worship he had had very little to eat all day and the drink does go to the head when you have not had enough to eat <\s>
<s> your worship may not know but it is the truth <\s>
<s> and i would like to say that all through his married life i have never known him to do such a thing before though we have passed through great hardships and speaking with soft emphasis i am quite sure he would not have done it if he had been himself at the time <\s>

<s> pointing at jack you ask im wot made im take the roper <\s>

<s> you ask im wot made im take the lady's but the bald constable catches him by the sleeve bald constable <\s>
<s> emphatically now listen to me <\s>
<s> i ve nothing to do with what he may or may not have taken <\s>
<s> why did you resist the police in the execution of their duty <\s>
<s> it war n't their duty to take my wife a respectable woman that ad n't done nothing <\s>

<s> what made you strike the officer a blow <\s>
<s> any man would a struck im a blow <\s>
<s> i'd strike im again i would <\s>
<s> you are not making your case any better by violence <\s>
<s> how do you suppose we could get on if everybody behaved like you <\s>

<s> i don't want it smothered up i want it all dealt with fair i want my rights magistrate <\s>
<s> rapping his desk now you have said all you have to say and you will be quiet <\s>

<s> i ve sent bob for your things with the wheelbarrow what have you got only a bag i suppose <\s>
<s> sitting with a smile that's all uncle tom except my trunk and hat box <\s>
<s> and what's his name brought a bag i suppose <\s>
<s> i hope it's not too much uncle tom <\s>
<s> i suppose you see a good deal of of lever <\s>
<s> that's his brother in the guards isn't it <\s>
<s> now what does this chap do <\s>
<s> what should he do uncle tom <\s>
<s> dubiously your bringing him down was a good idea <\s>
<s> gwyn looking at him sidelong bites her lips i should like to have a look at him <\s>
<s> but i say you know molly mines mines <\s>
<s> there are a lot of these chaps about whose business is to cook their own dinners <\s>
<s> your aunt thinks mrs <\s>
<s> uncle tom don't tell me what aunt nell thinks <\s>
<s> look here old girl <\s>
<s> it's my experience never to what i mean is never to trust too much to a man who has to do with mining <\s>
<s> i've always refused to have anything to do with mines <\s>
<s> if your husband were in england of course i'd say nothing <\s>
<s> very still we'd better keep him out of the question had n't we <\s>
<s> of course if you wish it my dear <\s>
<s> yes i know but look here molly your aunt thinks you're in a very delicate position in fact she thinks you see too much of young lever <\s>
<s> stretching herself like an angry cat does she <\s>
<s> and what do you think <\s>
<s> i make a point of not thinking <\s>
<s> i only know that here he is and i don't want you to go burning your fingers eh <\s>
<s> gwyn sits with a vindictive smile a gold mine's a gold mine <\s>
<s> i don't mean he deliberately but they take in women and parsons and and all sorts of fools <\s>
<s> looking down and then you know i can't tell your feelings my dear and i don't want to but a man about town ll compromise a woman as soon as he'll look at her and softly shaking his head i don't like that molly <\s>
<s> it s not the thing <\s>
<s> gwyn sits unmoved smiling the same smile and the colonel gives her a nervous look if if you were any other woman i should n't care and if if you were a plain woman damme you might do what you liked <\s>
<s> i know you and geoff don't get on but here's this child of yours devoted to you and and don't you see old girl <\s>
<s> with a little hard laugh thanks <\s>
<s> i suppose as you don't think uncle tom it never occurred to you that i have rather a lonely time of it <\s>
<s> my dear yes of course i know it must be beastly <\s>
<s> speaking in a surprised voice i don't know what i m talking like this for <\s>
<s> she goes on at me till she gets on my nerves <\s>
<s> what d you think she wants me to do now <\s>
<s> put money into this gold mine <\s>
<s> did you ever hear such folly <\s>
<s> breaking into laughter oh <\s>
<s> all very well for you to laugh molly <\s>
<s> calmly and how much are you going to put in <\s>
<s> why i've got nothing but my pension and three thousand india stock <\s>
<s> only ninety pounds a year besides your pension <\s>
<s> d you mean to say that's all you've got uncle tom <\s>
<s> i never knew that before <\s>
<s> feelingly it is a d d shame <\s>
<s> i don't suppose there's another case in the army of a man being treated as i've been <\s>
<s> but how on earth do you manage here on so little <\s>
<s> brooding your aunt's very funny <\s>
<s> she's a born manager <\s>
<s> she d manage the hind leg off a donkey but if i want five shillings for a charity or what not i have to whistle for it <\s>
<s> and then all of a sudden molly she'll take it into her head to spend goodness knows what on some trumpery or other and come to me for the money <\s>
<s> if i have n't got it to give her out she flies about 3 per cent and worries me to invest in some wild cat or other like your friend's thing the jaco what is it <\s>
<s> i don't pay the slightest attention to her <\s>
<s> from the direction of the house tom <\s>
<s> then dropping his voice i say molly don't you mind what i said about young lever <\s>
<s> i don't want you to imagine that i think harm of people you know i don't but so many women come to grief and hotly i can't stand men about town not that he of course mrs <\s>
<s> in hasty confidence i find it best to let your aunt run on <\s>
<s> if she says anything mrs <\s>
<s> gwyn sits drawing circles on the ground with her charming parasol <\s>
<s> suddenly she springs to her feet and stands waiting like an animal at bay <\s>
<s> the colonel and mrs <\s>
<s> hope approach her talking mrs <\s>
<s> well how was i to know <\s>
<s> did n't joy come and tell you <\s>
<s> i don't know what's the matter with that child <\s>
<s> well molly so here you are <\s>
<s> you're before your time that train's always late <\s>
<s> with faint irony i'm sorry aunt nell <\s>
<s> they bob seem to take fright and kiss each other gingerly mrs <\s>
<s> what have you done with mr <\s>
<s> i shall have to put him in peachey's room <\s>
<s> tom's got no champagne <\s>
<s> they've a very decent brand down at the george molly i'll send bob over mrs <\s>
<s> he'll just have to put up with what he can get <\s>
<s> he's not a snob <\s>
<s> for goodness sake aunt nell don't put yourself out <\s>
<s> i'm sorry i suggested his coming <\s>
<s> my dear we ought to have champagne in the house in case of accident <\s>
<s> shaking him gently by the coat no please uncle tom <\s>
<s> suddenly now i've told your uncle molly that he's not to go in for this gold mine without making certain it's a good thing <\s>
<s> mind i think you've been very rash <\s>
<s> i'm going to give you a good talking to and that's not all you ought n't to go about like this with a young man he's not at all bad looking <\s>
<s> i remember him perfectly well at the fleming's dance <\s>
<s> gwyn's lips there comes a little mocking smile colonel <\s>
<s> pulling his wife's sleeve nell <\s>
<s> no tom i'm going to talk to molly she's old enough to know better <\s>
<s> yes and you'll get yourself into a mess i don't approve of it and when i see a thing i don't approve of colonel <\s>
<s> walking about and pulling his moustache nell i won't have it i simply won't have it <\s>
<s> what rate of interest are these preference shares to pay <\s>
<s> still smiling ten per cent <\s>
<s> what did i tell you tom <\s>
<s> and are they safe <\s>
<s> you'd better ask maurice <\s>
<s> there you see you call him maurice <\s>
<s> now supposing your uncle went in for some of them colonel <\s>
<s> taking off his hat in a high hot voice i'm not going in for anything of the sort <\s>
<s> don't swing your hat by the brim <\s>
<s> go and look if you can see him coming <\s>
<s> the colonel goes in a lower voice your uncle's getting very bald <\s>
<s> i ve only shoulder of lamb for lunch and a salad <\s>
<s> it's lucky it's too hot to eat <\s>
<s> miss beech has appeared while she is speaking here she is peachey <\s>
<s> gwyn and looks at her intently mrs <\s>
<s> shrugging her shoulders well peachey <\s>
<s> what d you make of me <\s>
<s> returning from his search there's a white hat crossing the second stile <\s>
<s> is that your friend molly <\s>
<s> before i forget peachey letty and ernest can move their things back again <\s>
<s> i'm going to put mr <\s>
<s> lever in your room <\s>
<s> catching sight o f the paint pot on the ground there's that disgusting paint pot <\s>
<s> take it up at once tom and put it in the tree <\s>
<s> the colonel picks up the pot and bears it to the hollow tree followed by mrs <\s>
<s> hope he enters mrs <\s>
<s> speaking into the tree not there <\s>
<s> from within well where then <\s>
<s> gwyn standing alone is smiling <\s>
<s> lever approaches from the towing path <\s>
<s> he is a man like a fencer's wrist supple and steely <\s>
<s> a man whose age is difficult to tell with a quick good looking face and a line between his brows his darkish hair is flecked with grey <\s>
<s> he gives the feeling that he has always had to spurt to keep pace with his own life mrs <\s>
<s> also entering the hollow tree no oh <\s>
<s> from the depths in a high voice well dash it then <\s>
<s> what do you want <\s>
<s> peachey may i introduce mr <\s>
<s> miss beech my old governess <\s>
<s> they shake each other by the hand lever <\s>
<s> how do you do <\s>
<s> his voice is pleasant his manner easy miss beech <\s>
<s> pleased to meet you <\s>
<s> her manner is that of one who is not pleased <\s>
<s> pointing to the tree maliciously this is my uncle and my aunt <\s>
<s> they're taking exercise i think <\s>
<s> the colonel and mrs <\s>
<s> they are very hot <\s>
<s> gwyn are very cool mrs <\s>
<s> shaking hands with him so you ve got here <\s>
<s> are n't you very hot tom <\s>
<s> brought a splendid day with you <\s>
<s> as he speaks joy comes running with a bunch of roses seeing lever she stops and stands quite rigid miss beech <\s>
<s> sitting in the swing thunder <\s>
<s> nonsense peachey you're always imagining something <\s>
<s> look at the sky <\s>
<s> gwyn's smile has faded <\s>
<s> turning joy don't you see mr <\s>
<s> joy turning to her mother gives her the roses <\s>
<s> with a forced smile lever advances holding out his hand lever <\s>
<s> how are you joy <\s>
<s> have n't seen you for an age <\s>
<s> without expression i am very well thank you <\s>
<s> she raises her hand and just touches his <\s>
<s> gwyn's eyes are fixed on her daughter <\s>
<s> miss beech is watching them intently <\s>
<s> hope is buttoning the colonel's coat the curtain falls <\s>
<s> act ii it is afternoon and at a garden table placed beneath the hollow tree the colonel is poring over plans <\s>
<s> astride of a garden chair lever is smoking cigarettes <\s>
<s> dick is hanging chinese lanterns to the hollow tree <\s>
<s> of course if this level pointing with his cigarette peters out to the west we shall be in a tightish place you know what a mine is at this stage colonel hope <\s>
<s> tracing a line what is there to prevent its running out here to the east <\s>
<s> well nothing except that as a matter of fact it doesn't <\s>
<s> with some excitement i'm very glad you showed me these papers very glad <\s>
<s> i say that it's a most astonishing thing if the ore suddenly stops there <\s>
<s> a gleam of humour visits lever's face i'm not an expert but you ought to prove that ground to the east more thoroughly <\s>
<s> quizzically of course sir if you advise that colonel <\s>
<s> if it were mine i'd no more sit down under the belief that the ore stopped there than i d  there's a harmony in these things <\s>
<s> i can only tell you what our experts say <\s>
<s> no faith in them never had <\s>
<s> miners lawyers theologians cowardly lot pays them to be cowardly <\s>
<s> when they have n't their own axes to grind they've got their theories a theory's a dangerous thing <\s>
<s> he loses himself in contemplation of the papers now my theory is you re in strata here of what we call the triassic age <\s>
<s> you've struck a fault that's what's happened <\s>
<s> the ore may be as much as thirty or forty yards out but it s there depend on it <\s>
<s> would you back that opinion sir <\s>
<s> with dignity i never give an opinion that i'm not prepared to back <\s>
<s> i want to get to the bottom of this <\s>
<s> what's to prevent the gold going down indefinitely <\s>
<s> nothing so far as i know <\s>
<s> all i can tell you is this is as far as we've got and we want more money before we can get any farther <\s>
<s> absently yes yes that's very usual <\s>
<s> if you ask my personal opinion i think it's very doubtful that the gold does go down <\s>
<s> a personal opinion a matter of this sort <\s>
<s> as though about to take the papers perhaps we'd better close the sitting sir sorry to have bored you <\s>
<s> don't be so touchy <\s>
<s> if i'm to put money in i'm bound to look at it all round <\s>
<s> with lifted brows please don't imagine that i want you to put money in <\s>
<s> d you suppose i take you for a company promoter <\s>
<s> looking at him doubtfully you've got irish blood in you um <\s>
<s> if you re really thinking of taking shares my advice to you is don't <\s>
<s> regretfully if this were an ordinary gold mine i wouldn't dream of looking at it i want you to understand that <\s>
<s> nobody has a greater objection to gold mines than i <\s>
<s> looks down at his host with half closed eyes but it is a gold mine colonel hope <\s>
<s> i know i know but i ve been into it for myself i've formed my opinion personally <\s>
<s> now what s the reason you don't want me to invest <\s>
<s> well if it doesn't turn out as you expect you'll say it's my doing <\s>
<s> i know what investors are <\s>
<s> dubiously if it were a westralian or a kaffir i would n't touch it with a pair of tongs <\s>
<s> it s not as if i were going to put much in <\s>
<s> he suddenly bends above the papers as though magnetically attracted i like these triassic formations <\s>
<s> dick who has hung the last lantern moodily departs lever <\s>
<s> looking after him that young man seems depressed <\s>
<s> as though remembering his principles i don't like mines never have <\s>
<s> suddenly absorbed again i tell you what lever this thing's got tremendous possibilities <\s>
<s> you don't seem to believe in it enough <\s>
<s> no mine's any good without faith until i see for myself however i shan't commit myself beyond a thousand <\s>
<s> are you serious sir <\s>
<s> i've been thinking it over ever since you told me henty had fought shy <\s>
<s> i ve a poor opinion of henty <\s>
<s> he's one of those fellows that says one thing and does another <\s>
<s> slowly i'm afraid we're all that more or less <\s>
<s> he sits beneath the hollow tree colonel <\s>
<s> a man never knows what he is himself <\s>
<s> there s my wife <\s>

<s> and lever nervously i don't think you know this is quite the sort of thing for my niece <\s>
<s> i mean to get her out of it <\s>
<s> a little taken aback ah <\s>
<s> you know she she's in a very delicate position living by herself in london <\s>
<s> lever looks at him ironically you very nervously see a good deal of her <\s>
<s> if it had n't been for joy growing so fast we shouldn't have had the child down here <\s>
<s> her mother ought to have her with her <\s>
<s> don't you think so <\s>
<s> forcing a smile mrs <\s>
<s> gwyn always seems to me to get on all right <\s>
<s> as though making a discovery you know i've found that when a woman's living alone and unprotected the very least thing will set a lot of hags and jackanapes talking <\s>
<s> hotly the more unprotected and helpless a woman is the more they revel in it <\s>
<s> if there's anything i hate in this world it's those wretched creatures who babble about their neighbours affairs <\s>
<s> i agree with you <\s>
<s> one ought to be very careful not to give them that is checks himself confused then hurrying on i suppose you and joy get on all right <\s>
<s> coolly pretty well thanks <\s>
<s> i'm not exactly in joy's line have n't seen very much of her in fact <\s>
<s> miss beech and joy have been approaching from the house <\s>

<s> she was only sticking up for her friends <\s>
<s> ask the old peachey bird <\s>
<s> she knows a thing or two <\s>
<s> look here i don't mind a man's being a bit of a sportsman but i think molly's bringin him down here is too thick <\s>
<s> your old dad's got one of his notions that because this josser's his guest he must keep him in a glass case and take shares in his mine and all the rest of it <\s>
<s> i do think people are horrible always thinking things <\s>
<s> it's not as if molly were a stranger <\s>

<s> bowing whatever is good enough for miss beech is good enough for me <\s>
<s> sardonically taking another sandwich so you think <\s>
<s> with forced gaiety don't be so absurd peachey <\s>

<s> there isn't the smallest necessity for colonel hope to take any shares and it looks to me as if he'd better not <\s>
<s> he lights a cigarette mrs <\s>
<s> lever don't be offended <\s>

<s> gwyn and lever are seen approaching they pass the tree in conversation mrs <\s>
<s> but i don't see why maurice <\s>
<s> we mean to sell the mine we must do some more work on it and for that we must have money <\s>
<s> if you only want a little i should have thought you could have got it in a minute in the city <\s>

<s> he mustn't take them <\s>
<s> that s all very well but it s not so simple <\s>
<s> shyly but maurice have you told him about the selling <\s>
<s> gloomily under the hollow tree it s a board secret <\s>
<s> i'd no business to tell even you <\s>

<s> you can't go into a mining venture without some risk <\s>
<s> oh yes i know but but uncle tom is such a dear <\s>
<s> stubbornly i can't help his being the sort of man he is <\s>
<s> i did n't want him to take these shares i told him so in so many words <\s>

<s> they are divided from her by the hollow tree she is unseen <\s>
<s> i think he ought to be told about the selling it s not fair <\s>

<s> i don't understand that kind of man <\s>
<s> impulsively i must tell him maurice i can't let him take the shares without she puts her hand on his arm joy turns as if to go back whence she came but stops once more lever <\s>

<s> if i were to give you up you'd forget me in a month <\s>
<s> why do you say such things <\s>
<s> if only i could believe i was necessary to you <\s>
<s> forcing the fervour of his voice but you are <\s>
<s> with the ghost of a smile midsummer day <\s>
<s> she gives a laugh that breaks into a sob the music o f a waltz sounds from the house lever <\s>
<s> for god's sake don't molly i don't believe in going to meet trouble <\s>

<s> gwyn has turned away her face covering it with her hands don't molly <\s>

<s> one can't sit it out and dance it too <\s>
<s> which is it to be maurice dancing or sitting out <\s>
<s> it must be one or the other must n't it <\s>

<s> this is all that s left of me <\s>

<s> are you all right now darling <\s>
<s> trying to smile yes dear quite <\s>
<s> then let s go and dance <\s>
<s> they go for a few seconds the hollow tree stands alone then from the house rose comes and enters it <\s>
<s> she takes out a bottle of champagne wipes it and carries it away but seeing mrs <\s>
<s> gwyn's scarf lying across the chair she fingers it and stops listening to the waltz <\s>
<s> suddenly draping it round her shoulders she seizes the bottle of champagne and waltzes with abandon to the music as though avenging a long starvation of her instincts <\s>
<s> thus dancing she is surprised by dick who has come to smoke a cigarette and think at the spot where he was told to have a go <\s>
<s> rose startled stops and hugs the bottle dick <\s>
<s> it's not claret rose i should n't warm it <\s>
<s> rose taking off the scarf replaces it on the chair then with the half warmed bottle she retreats <\s>
<s> dick in the swing sits thinking of his fate <\s>
<s> suddenly from behind the hollow tree he sees joy darting forward in her day dress with her hair about her neck and her skirt all torn <\s>
<s> as he springs towards her she turns at bay dick <\s>
<s> i want uncle tom <\s>
<s> in consternation but ought you to have got up i thought you were ill in bed oughtn't you to be lying down <\s>

<s> i don't care i listened <\s>
<s> i would n't if it had been anybody else but i hate him <\s>
<s> gravely what did you hear <\s>
<s> he s keeping back something uncle tom ought to know <\s>

<s> was it something that really matters i don't want to know what <\s>
<s> what a beastly thing are you quite certain joy <\s>
<s> between her teeth yes <\s>
<s> then you must tell him of course even if you did overhear <\s>
<s> you can't stand by and see the colonel swindled <\s>
<s> whom was he talking to <\s>
<s> i won't tell you <\s>
<s> taking her wrist was it was it your mother <\s>
<s> joy bends her head but if it was your mother why does n't she joy <\s>
<s> still holding her i mean i can't see what joy <\s>

<s> she waits for him to speak but he does not i'm going to show what he is so that mother shan't speak to him again <\s>

<s> we ve been hateful to each other for years <\s>
<s> can you understand that <\s>
<s> don't cover your face like a child look at me <\s>
<s> joy drops her hands and lifts her face <\s>
<s> gwyn looks back at her her lips are quivering she goes on speaking with stammering rapidity d you think because i suffered when you were born and because i ve suffered since with every ache you ever had that that gives you the right to dictate to me now <\s>
<s> in a dead voice i've been unhappy enough and i shall be unhappy enough in the time to come <\s>
<s> meeting the hard wonder in joy's face oh <\s>

<s> there has never been a woman joy that did not fall in love <\s>
<s> in a despairing whisper but it s wrong of you it's wicked <\s>
<s> if it's wicked i shall pay for it not you <\s>
<s> but i want to save you mother <\s>
<s> breaking into laughter joy <\s>
<s> i can't bear it that you if you ll only i'll never leave you <\s>

<s> in a sudden outburst of excited fear i won't believe it i i can't you're deserting me mother <\s>

<s> mother it s for me <\s>

<s> joy turns her face away <\s>
<s> gwyn bends suddenly and touches her daughter's hair joy shrinks from that touch recoiling as though she had been stung i forgot i m deserting you <\s>
<s> and swiftly without looking back she goes away <\s>
<s> joy left alone under the hollow tree crouches lower and her shoulders shake <\s>
<s> here dick finds her when he hears no longer any sound o f voices <\s>
<s> he falls on his knees beside her dick <\s>
<s> joy dear don't cry <\s>
<s> it's so dreadful to see you <\s>
<s> i d do anything not to see you cry <\s>
<s> joy is still for a moment then the shaking of the shoulders begins again joy darling <\s>
<s> it's so awful you ll make yourself ill and it is n't worth it really <\s>
<s> i d do anything to save you pain won't you stop just for a minute <\s>
<s> joy is still again nothing in the world s worth your crying joy <\s>
<s> give me just a little look <\s>
<s> looking in a smothered voice don't <\s>
<s> you do look so sweet <\s>
<s> oh joy i'll comfort you i'll take it all on myself <\s>
<s> i know all about it <\s>
<s> joy gives a sobbing laugh i do <\s>
<s> i ve had trouble too i swear i have <\s>
<s> it gets better it does really <\s>
<s> you don't know it's it's dick <\s>
<s> don't think about it <\s>
<s> i know exactly what it's like <\s>
<s> he strokes her arm joy <\s>
<s> shrinking in a whisper you mustn't <\s>
<s> the music of a waltz is heard again dick <\s>
<s> it's no good we must talk it over calmly <\s>
<s> it's the it s the disgrace dick <\s>
<s> as to disgrace she's your mother whatever she does i'd like to see anybody say anything about her viciously i'd punch his head <\s>
<s> gulping her tears that does n't help <\s>
<s> but if she doesn't love your father joy <\s>
<s> but she's married to him <\s>
<s> hastily yes of course i know marriage is awfully important but a man understands these things <\s>
<s> joy looks at him <\s>
<s> seeing the impression he has made he tries again i mean he understands better than a woman <\s>
<s> i've often argued about moral questions with men up at oxford <\s>
<s> catching at a straw but there's nothing to argue about <\s>
<s> hastily of course i believe in morals <\s>
<s> they stare solemnly at each other some men don't <\s>
<s> but i can't help seeing marriage is awfully important <\s>
<s> yes i know but there must be exceptions joy <\s>
<s> losing herself a little in the stress of this discussion how can there be exceptions if a thing s sacred <\s>
<s> earnestly all rules have exceptions that's true you know it's a proverb <\s>
<s> it can't be true about marriage how can it when <\s>
<s> with intense earnestness but look here joy i know a really clever man an author <\s>
<s> he says that if marriage is a failure people ought to be perfectly free it isn't everybody who believes that marriage is everything <\s>
<s> of course i believe it s sacred but if it's a failure i do think it seems awful don't you <\s>
<s> i don't know yes if suddenly but it's my own mother <\s>
<s> gravely i know of course <\s>
<s> i can't expect you to see it in your own case like this <\s>
<s> with desperation but look here joy this'll show you <\s>
<s> if a person loves a person they have to decide have n't they <\s>
<s> well then you see that s what your mother's done <\s>
<s> but that does n't show me anything <\s>
<s> the thing is to look at it as if it was n't yourself <\s>
<s> if it had been you and me in love joy and it was wrong like them of course ruefully i know you'd have decided right <\s>
<s> fiercely but i swear i should have decided wrong <\s>
<s> triumphantly that s why i feel i understand your mother <\s>
<s> brushing her sleeve across her eyes oh dick you are so sweet and and funny <\s>
<s> sliding his arm about her i love you joy that s why and i ll love you till you don't feel it any more <\s>
<s> i'll love you all day and every day you shan't miss anything i swear it <\s>
<s> it s such a beautiful night it s on purpose <\s>
<s> look joy looks he looks at her but it s not so beautiful as you <\s>
<s> bending her head you mustn't <\s>
<s> i don't know what's coming <\s>
<s> sidling closer are n't your knees tired darling <\s>
<s> i i can't get near you properly <\s>
<s> with a sob oh <\s>
<s> dick you are a funny comfort <\s>
<s> we'll stick together joy always nothing'll matter then <\s>
<s> they struggle to their feet the waltz sounds louder you're missing it all <\s>
<s> i can't bear you to miss the dancing <\s>
<s> it seems so queer <\s>
<s> just a little turn <\s>
<s> he takes her gently by the waist she shrinks back joy <\s>
<s> dick to morrow ll be so awful <\s>
<s> to morrow shan't hurt you joy nothing shall ever hurt you again <\s>
<s> she looks at him and her face changes suddenly she buries it against his shoulder they stand so just a moment in the moon light then turning to the river move slowly out of sight <\s>
<s> again the hollow tree is left alone <\s>
<s> the music of the waltz has stopped <\s>
<s> the voices of miss beech and the colonel are heard approaching from the house <\s>
<s> they appear in the opening of the wall <\s>
<s> the colonel carries a pair of field glasses with which to look at the moon colonel <\s>
<s> charming to see molly dance with lever their steps go so well together <\s>
<s> i can always tell when a woman's enjoying herself peachey <\s>
<s> i'm going to have a look at her <\s>

<s> i remember in burmah with these glasses i used to be able to tell a man from a woman at two miles and a quarter <\s>
<s> and that's no joke i can tell you <\s>
<s> but on his way to the moon he has taken a survey of the earth to the right along the river <\s>
<s> in a low but excited voice i say i say is it one of the maids the baggage <\s>
<s> by george she's got her hair down peachey <\s>
<s> miss beech goes to look <\s>
<s> he makes as though to hand the glasses to her but puts them to his own eyes instead excitedly it is <\s>
<s> what about her headache <\s>
<s> by george they're kissing <\s>
<s> i shall have to tell nell <\s>
<s> are you sure they're kissing <\s>
<s> well that's some comfort <\s>
<s> they're at the stile now <\s>
<s> oughtn't i to stop them eh <\s>
<s> he stands on tiptoe we must n't spy on them dash it all <\s>
<s> he drops the glasses they're out of sight now <\s>
<s> to herself he said he wouldn't let her <\s>

<s> we've had that over a dozen times <\s>
<s> well i've never understood it <\s>
<s> they talk of the engineers and furnace men's demands being excessive so they are but that's not enough to make the union withdraw their support <\s>

<s> with triumph afraid of other strikes now that's a reason <\s>
<s> why could n't we have been told that before <\s>
<s> you were absent from the board that day sir <\s>

<s> shaking his head i've never liked a fight never shall <\s>
<s> all look at him wilder <\s>

<s> when the men sent roberts up to the board in december then was the time <\s>

<s> when we do get started we shall have to work off our contracts at the top of the market <\s>
<s> what do you say to that chairman <\s>
<s> shan't pay a dividend till goodness knows when <\s>
<s> with emphasis we ought to think of the shareholders <\s>
<s> turning heavily chairman i say we ought to think of the shareholders <\s>
<s> the chairman says he is thinking of you sir <\s>
<s> sinking back into torpor cynic <\s>
<s> it's past a joke <\s>
<s> i don't want to go without a dividend for years if the chairman does <\s>
<s> we can't go on playing ducks and drakes with the company's prosperity <\s>
<s> rather ashamedly i think we ought to consider the men <\s>
<s> all but anthony fidget in their seats scantlebury <\s>
<s> with a sigh we must n't think of our private feelings young man <\s>
<s> ironically i'm not thinking of our feelings <\s>
<s> i'm thinking of the men's <\s>
<s> as to that we're men of business <\s>
<s> that is the little trouble <\s>
<s> there's no necessity for pushing things so far in the face of all this suffering it's it's cruel <\s>
<s> no one speaks as though edgar had uncovered something whose existence no man prizing his self respect could afford to recognise wanklin <\s>
<s> with an ironical smile i'm afraid we must n't base our policy on luxuries like sentiment <\s>
<s> i detest this state of things <\s>
<s> we did n't seek the quarrel <\s>
<s> i know that sir but surely we've gone far enough <\s>
<s> all look at one another wanklin <\s>
<s> luxuries apart chairman we must look out what we're doing <\s>
<s> give way to the men once and there'll be no end to it <\s>
<s> i quite agree but anthony shakes his head you make it a question of bedrock principle <\s>
<s> anthony nods luxuries again chairman <\s>
<s> the shares are below par <\s>
<s> yes and they'll drop to a half when we pass the next dividend <\s>
<s> with alarm come come <\s>
<s> not so bad as that <\s>
<s> craning forward to catch anthony's speech i didn't catch tench <\s>
<s> hesitating the chairman says sir fais que que devra <\s>
<s> sharply my father says do what we ought and let things rip <\s>
<s> throwing up his hands the chairman's a stoic i always said the chairman was a stoic <\s>
<s> much good that'll do us <\s>
<s> suavely seriously chairman are you going to let the ship sink under you for the sake of a principle <\s>
<s> with alarm not while i'm on the board i hope <\s>
<s> with a twinkle better rat scantlebury <\s>
<s> i've always fought them i've never been beaten yet <\s>
<s> we're with you in theory chairman <\s>
<s> but we're not all made of cast iron <\s>
<s> we've only to hold on <\s>
<s> rising and going to the fire and go to the devil as fast as we can <\s>
<s> better go to the devil than give in <\s>
<s> fretfully that may suit you sir but it does n't suit me or any one else i should think <\s>
<s> anthony looks him in the face a silence edgar <\s>
<s> i don't see how we can get over it that to go on like this means starvation to the men's wives and families <\s>
<s> wilder turns abruptly to the fire and scantlebury puts out a hand to push the idea away wanklin <\s>
<s> i'm afraid again that sounds a little sentimental <\s>
<s> men of business are excused from decency you think <\s>
<s> nobody's more sorry for the men than i am but if they lashing himself choose to be such a pig headed lot it's nothing to do with us we've quite enough on our hands to think of ourselves and the shareholders <\s>
<s> irritably it won't kill the shareholders to miss a dividend or two i don't see that that's reason enough for knuckling under <\s>
<s> with grave discomfort you talk very lightly of your dividends young man i don't know where we are <\s>
<s> there's only one sound way of looking at it <\s>
<s> we can't go on ruining ourselves with this strike <\s>
<s> with a gesture of despair look at him <\s>
<s> anthony's leaning back in his chair <\s>
<s> they do look at him wilder <\s>
<s> returning to his seat well all i can say is if that's the chairman's view i don't know what we've come down here for <\s>
<s> to tell the men that we've got nothing for them grimly they won't believe it till they hear it spoken in plain english <\s>
<s> shouldn't be a bit surprised if that brute roberts had n't got us down here with the very same idea <\s>
<s> i hate a man with a grievance <\s>
<s> resentfully we didn't pay him enough for his discovery <\s>
<s> i always said that at the time <\s>
<s> we paid him five hundred and a bonus of two hundred three years later <\s>
<s> if that's not enough <\s>
<s> what does he want for goodness sake <\s>
<s> complainingly company made a hundred thousand out of his brains and paid him seven hundred that's the way he goes on sir <\s>
<s> the man's a rank agitator <\s>
<s> look here i hate the unions <\s>
<s> but now we've got harness here let's get him to settle the whole thing <\s>
<s> again they look at him underwood <\s>
<s> roberts won't let the men assent to that <\s>
<s> looking at anthony and not the only one <\s>
<s> frost enters from the hall frost <\s>
<s> harness from the union waiting sir <\s>
<s> the men are here too sir <\s>
<s> underwood goes to the door returning with harness a pale clean shaven man with hollow cheeks quick eyes and lantern jaw frost has retired underwood <\s>
<s> pointing to tench's chair sit there next the chairman harness won't you <\s>
<s> at harness's appearance the board have drawn together as it were and turned a little to him like cattle at a dog harness <\s>
<s> with a sharp look round and a bow thanks <\s>
<s> he sits his accent is slightly nasal well gentlemen we're going to do business at last i hope <\s>
<s> depends on what you call business harness <\s>
<s> why don't you make the men come in <\s>
<s> sardonically the men are far more in the right than you are <\s>
<s> the question with us is whether we shan't begin to support them again <\s>
<s> he ignores them all except anthony to whom he turns in speaking anthony <\s>
<s> support them if you like we'll put in free labour and have done with it <\s>
<s> that won't do mr <\s>
<s> you can't get free labour and you know it <\s>
<s> we shall see that <\s>
<s> i'm quite frank with you <\s>
<s> we were forced to withhold our support from your men because some of their demands are in excess of current rates <\s>
<s> i expect to make them withdraw those demands to day if they do take it straight from me gentlemen we shall back them again at once <\s>
<s> now i want to see something fixed upon before i go back to night <\s>
<s> can't we have done with this old fashioned tug of war business <\s>
<s> what good's it doing you <\s>
<s> why don't you recognise once for all that these people are men like yourselves and want what's good for them just as you want what's good for you bitterly your motor cars and champagne and eight course dinners <\s>
<s> if the men will come in we'll do something for them <\s>
<s> ironically is that your opinion too sir and yours and yours <\s>
<s> the directors do not answer well all i can say is it's a kind of high and mighty aristocratic tone i thought we'd grown out of seems i was mistaken <\s>
<s> it's the tone the men use <\s>
<s> remains to be seen which can hold out longest they without us or we without them <\s>
<s> as business men i wonder you're not ashamed of this waste of force gentlemen <\s>
<s> you know what it'll all end in <\s>
<s> can't you persuade the men that their interests are the same as ours <\s>
<s> turning ironically i could persuade them of that sir if they were <\s>
<s> come harness you're a clever man you don't believe all the socialistic claptrap that's talked nowadays <\s>
<s> there s no real difference between their interests and ours <\s>
<s> there's just one very simple question i'd like to put to you <\s>
<s> will you pay your men one penny more than they force you to pay them <\s>
<s> wilder is silent wanklin <\s>
<s> chiming in i humbly thought that not to pay more than was necessary was the a b c of commerce <\s>
<s> with irony yes that seems to be the a b c of commerce sir and the a b c of commerce is between your interests and the men's <\s>
<s> whispering we ought to arrange something <\s>
<s> drily am i to understand then gentlemen that your board is going to make no concessions <\s>
<s> wanklin and wilder bend forward as if to speak but stop anthony <\s>
<s> wanklin and wilder again bend forward and scantlebury gives an unexpected grunt harness <\s>
<s> you were about to say something i believe <\s>
<s> but scantlebury says nothing edgar <\s>
<s> looking up suddenly we're sorry for the state of the men <\s>
<s> icily the men have no use for your pity sir <\s>
<s> what they want is justice <\s>
<s> then let them be just <\s>
<s> for that word just read humble mr <\s>
<s> why should they be humble <\s>
<s> barring the accident of money are n't they as good men as you <\s>
<s> well i've been five years in america <\s>
<s> it colours a man's notions <\s>
<s> suddenly as though avenging his uncompleted grunt let's have the men in and hear what they've got to say <\s>
<s> anthony nods and underwood goes out by the single door harness <\s>
<s> drily as i'm to have an interview with them this afternoon gentlemen i ll ask you to postpone your final decision till that's over <\s>
<s> again anthony nods and taking up his glass drinks underwood comes in again followed by roberts green bulgin thomas rous <\s>
<s> they file in hat in hand and stand silent in a row <\s>
<s> roberts is lean of middle height with a slight stoop <\s>
<s> he has a little rat gnawn brown grey beard moustaches high cheek bones hollow cheeks small fiery eyes <\s>
<s> he wears an old and grease stained blue serge suit and carries an old bowler hat <\s>
<s> he stands nearest the chairman <\s>
<s> green next to him has a clean worn face with a small grey goatee beard and drooping moustaches iron spectacles and mild straightforward eyes <\s>
<s> he wears an overcoat green with age and a linen collar <\s>
<s> next to him is bulgin a tall strong man with a dark moustache and fighting jaw wearing a red muffler who keeps changing his cap from one hand to the other <\s>
<s> next to him is thomas an old man with a grey moustache full beard and weatherbeaten bony face whose overcoat discloses a lean plucked looking neck <\s>
<s> on his right rous the youngest of the five looks like a soldier he has a glitter in his eyes underwood <\s>
<s> pointing there are some chairs there against the wall roberts won't you draw them up and sit down <\s>
<s> underwood we'll stand in the presence of the board <\s>
<s> he speaks in a biting and staccato voice rolling his r's pronouncing his a's like an italian a and his consonants short and crisp how are you mr <\s>
<s> did n't expect t have the pleasure of seeing you till this afternoon <\s>
<s> steadily we shall meet again then roberts <\s>
<s> glad to hear that we shall have some news for you to take to your people <\s>
<s> what do the men want <\s>
<s> acidly beg pardon i don't quite catch the chairman's remark <\s>
<s> from behind the chairman's chair the chairman wishes to know what the men have to say <\s>
<s> it's what the board has to say we've come to hear <\s>
<s> it's for the board to speak first <\s>
<s> the board has nothing to say <\s>
<s> looking along the line of men in that case we're wasting the directors time <\s>
<s> we'll be taking our feet off this pretty carpet <\s>
<s> he turns the men move slowly as though hypnotically influenced wanklin suavely come roberts you did n't give us this long cold journey for the pleasure of saying that <\s>
<s> a pure welshman no sir an what i say iss roberts bitingly go on henry thomas go on <\s>
<s> you re better able to speak to the directors than me <\s>
<s> thomas is silent tench <\s>
<s> the chairman means roberts that it was the men who asked for the conference the board wish to hear what they have to say <\s>
<s> if i was to begin to tell ye all they have to say i wouldn't be finished to day <\s>
<s> and there'd be some that'd wish they'd never left their london palaces <\s>
<s> what's your proposition man <\s>
<s> you want reason mr <\s>
<s> take a look round this afternoon before the meeting <\s>

<s> all right my friend you won't put me off <\s>
<s> to the men we shan't put mr <\s>
<s> have some champagne with your lunch mr <\s>
<s> harness you'll want it sir <\s>
<s> come get to business man <\s>
<s> what we're asking look you is just simple justice <\s>
<s> venomously justice from london <\s>
<s> what are you talking about henry thomas <\s>
<s> have you gone silly <\s>
<s> thomas is silent we know very well what we are discontented dogs never satisfied <\s>
<s> what did the chairman tell me up in london <\s>
<s> that i did n't know what i was talking about <\s>
<s> i was a foolish uneducated man that knew nothing of the wants of the men i spoke for edgar <\s>
<s> do please keep to the point <\s>
<s> holding up his hand there can only be one master roberts <\s>
<s> then be gad it'll be us <\s>
<s> there is a silence anthony and roberts stare at one another underwood <\s>
<s> if you've nothing to say to the directors roberts perhaps you ll let green or thomas speak for the men <\s>
<s> green and thomas look anxiously at roberts at each other and the other men green <\s>

<s> aye they shall keep their souls for it's not much body that you've left them mr <\s>
<s> with biting emphasis as though the word were an offence scantlebury <\s>
<s> to the men well will you speak or shall i speak for you <\s>
<s> suddenly speak out roberts or leave it to others <\s>
<s> ironically thank you george rous <\s>
<s> addressing himself to anthony the chairman and board of directors have honoured us by leaving london and coming all this way to hear what we've got to say it would not be polite to keep them any longer waiting <\s>
<s> well thank god for that <\s>
<s> ye will not dare to thank him when i have done mr <\s>
<s> wilder for all your piety <\s>
<s> may be your god up in london has no time to listen to the working man <\s>
<s> i'm told he is a wealthy god but if he listens to what i tell him he will know more than ever he learned in kensington <\s>
<s> come roberts you have your own god <\s>

<s> for goodness sake let s keep to the point roberts <\s>

<s> if you can get the god of capital to walk through the streets of labour and pay attention to what he sees you're a brighter man than i take you for for all that you're a radical <\s>

<s> throughout all that follows he and anthony look fixedly upon each other <\s>
<s> men and directors show in their various ways suppressed uneasiness as though listening to words that they themselves would not have spoken the men can't afford to travel up to london and they don't trust you to believe what they say in black and white <\s>

<s> we can't be no worse off than we've been these weeks past <\s>
<s> ye need n't think that by waiting yell drive us to come in <\s>
<s> we'll die first the whole lot of us <\s>
<s> the men have sent for ye to know once and for all whether ye are going to grant them their demands <\s>
<s> i see the sheet of paper in the secretary's hand <\s>
<s> tench moves nervously that's it i think mr <\s>
<s> it's not very large <\s>
<s> there's not one sentence of writing on that paper that we can do without <\s>
<s> a movement amongst the men <\s>
<s> roberts turns on them sharply isn't that so <\s>
<s> the men assent reluctantly <\s>
<s> anthony takes from tench the paper and peruses it not one single sentence <\s>
<s> all those demands are fair <\s>
<s> asked anything that we are not entitled to ask <\s>
<s> what i said up in london i say again now there is not anything on that piece of paper that a just man should not ask and a just man give <\s>
<s> there is not one single demand on this paper that we will grant <\s>
<s> in the stir that follows on these words roberts watches the directors and anthony the men <\s>
<s> wilder gets up abruptly and goes over to the fire roberts <\s>
<s> d ye mean that <\s>
<s> wilder at the fire makes an emphatic movement of disgust roberts <\s>
<s> noting it with dry intensity ye best know whether the condition of the company is any better than the condition of the men <\s>
<s> scanning the directors faces ye best know whether ye can afford your tyranny but this i tell ye if ye think the men will give way the least part of an inch ye're making the worst mistake ye ever made <\s>
<s> he fixes his eyes on scantlebury ye think because the union is not supporting us more shame to it that we'll be coming on our knees to you one fine morning <\s>
<s> ye think because the men have got their wives an families to think of that it's just a question of a week or two anthony <\s>
<s> it would be better if you did not speculate so much on what we think <\s>
<s> it's not much profit to us <\s>
<s> i will say this for you mr <\s>
<s> anthony ye know your own mind <\s>
<s> staying at anthony i can reckon on ye <\s>
<s> ironically i am obliged to you <\s>
<s> and i know mine <\s>
<s> i tell ye this the men will send their wives and families where the country will have to keep them an they will starve sooner than give way <\s>
<s> i advise ye mr <\s>
<s> anthony to prepare yourself for the worst that can happen to your company <\s>
<s> we are not so ignorant as you might suppose <\s>
<s> we know the way the cat is jumping <\s>
<s> your position is not all that it might be not exactly <\s>
<s> be good enough to allow us to judge of our position for ourselves <\s>
<s> go back and reconsider your own <\s>
<s> anthony you are not a young man now from the time i remember anything ye have been an enemy to every man that has come into your works <\s>
<s> i don't say that ye're a mean man or a cruel man but ye've grudged them the say of any word in their own fate <\s>
<s> ye've fought them down four times <\s>
<s> i've heard ye say ye love a fight mark my words ye're fighting the last fight ye'll ever fight <\s>
<s> tench touches roberts's sleeve underwood <\s>
<s> i must n't speak my mind to the chairman but the chairman may speak his mind to me <\s>
<s> what are things coming to <\s>
<s> anthony with a grim smile at wilder go on roberts say what you like <\s>
<s> after a pause i have no more to say <\s>
<s> the meeting stands adjourned to five o'clock <\s>
<s> in a low voice to underwood we shall never settle anything like this <\s>
<s> bitingly we thank the chairman and board of directors for their gracious hearing <\s>
<s> he moves towards the door the men cluster together stupefied then rous throwing up his head passes roberts and goes out <\s>
<s> the others follow roberts <\s>
<s> with his hand on the door maliciously good day gentlemen <\s>
<s> he goes out harness <\s>
<s> ironically i congratulate you on the conciliatory spirit that's been displayed <\s>
<s> with your permission gentlemen i'll be with you again at half past five <\s>
<s> he bows slightly rests his eyes on anthony who returns his stare unmoved and followed by underwood goes out <\s>
<s> there is a moment of uneasy silence <\s>
<s> underwood reappears in the doorway wilder <\s>
<s> with emphatic disgust well <\s>
<s> the double doors are opened enid <\s>
<s> standing in the doorway lunch is ready <\s>
<s> edgar getting up abruptly walks out past his sister wilder <\s>
<s> coming to lunch scantlebury <\s>
<s> rising heavily i suppose so i suppose so <\s>
<s> it's the only thing we can do <\s>
<s> they go out through the double doors wanklin <\s>
<s> in a low voice do you really mean to fight to a finish chairman <\s>
<s> the essence of things is to know when to stop <\s>
<s> anthony does not answer wanklin <\s>
<s> very gravely this way disaster lies <\s>
<s> the ancient trojans were fools to your father mrs <\s>
<s> he goes out through the double doors enid <\s>
<s> i want to speak to father frank <\s>
<s> underwood follows wanklin out <\s>
<s> tench passing round the table is restoring order to the scattered pens and papers enid <\s>
<s> are n't you coming dad <\s>
<s> anthony shakes his head <\s>
<s> enid looks meaningly at tench enid <\s>
<s> won't you go and have some lunch mr <\s>
<s> with papers in his hand thank you ma'am thank you <\s>
<s> he goes slowly looking back enid <\s>
<s> shutting the doors i do hope it's settled father <\s>
<s> have n't you done anything <\s>
<s> anthony shakes his head enid <\s>
<s> frank says they all want to come to a compromise really except that man roberts <\s>
<s> it's such a horrid position for us <\s>
<s> if you were the wife of the manager and lived down here and saw it all <\s>
<s> you can't realise dad <\s>
<s> we see all the distress <\s>
<s> you remember my maid annie who married roberts <\s>
<s> anthony nods it's so wretched her heart's weak since the strike began she has n't even been getting proper food <\s>
<s> i know it for a fact father <\s>
<s> give her what she wants poor woman <\s>
<s> roberts won't let her take anything from us <\s>
<s> staring before him i can't be answerable for the men's obstinacy <\s>
<s> do stop it for my sake <\s>
<s> with a keen look at her you don't understand my dear <\s>
<s> if i were on the board i'd do something <\s>
<s> what would you do <\s>
<s> it's because you can't bear to give way <\s>
<s> what do you know about necessity <\s>
<s> read your novels play your music talk your talk but don't try and tell me what's at the bottom of a struggle like this <\s>
<s> i live down here and see it <\s>
<s> what d you imagine stands between you and your class and these men that you're so sorry for <\s>
<s> coldly i don't know what you mean father <\s>
<s> in a few years you and your children would be down in the condition they're in but for those who have the eyes to see things as they are and the backbone to stand up for themselves <\s>
<s> you don't know the state the men are in <\s>
<s> i know it well enough <\s>
<s> you don't father if you did you would n't anthony <\s>
<s> it's you who don't know the simple facts of the position <\s>
<s> what sort of mercy do you suppose you'd get if no one stood between you and the continual demands of labour <\s>
<s> this sort of mercy he puts his hand up to his throat and squeezes it first would go your sentiments my dear then your culture and your comforts would be going all the time <\s>
<s> i don't believe in barriers between classes <\s>
<s> coldly and i don't know what that has to do with this question <\s>
<s> it will take a generation or two for you to understand <\s>
<s> it's only you and roberts father and you know it <\s>
<s> anthony thrusts out his lower lip it'll ruin the company <\s>
<s> allow me to judge of that <\s>
<s> resentfully i won't stand by and let poor annie roberts suffer like this <\s>
<s> and think of the children father <\s>
<s> with a grim smile what do you propose to do <\s>
<s> anthony only looks at her enid <\s>
<s> in a changed voice stroking his sleeve father you know you oughtn't to have this strain on you you know what dr <\s>
<s> no old man can afford to listen to old women <\s>
<s> but you have done enough even if it really is such a matter of principle with you <\s>
<s> her face works you you might think of us <\s>

<s> holding the papers and a pen to anthony very nervously would you sign these for me please sir <\s>
<s> anthony takes the pen and signs tench <\s>
<s> standing with a sheet of blotting paper behind edgar's chair begins speaking nervously i owe my position to you sir <\s>
<s> i'm obliged to see everything that's going on sir i i depend upon the company entirely <\s>
<s> if anything were to happen to it it'd be disastrous for me <\s>
<s> anthony nods and of course my wife's just had another and so it makes me doubly anxious just now <\s>

<s> with grim amusement not more terrible than they are up mine <\s>
<s> very nervously i know the company means a great deal to you sir <\s>
<s> it does i founded it <\s>
<s> if the strike goes on it'll be very serious <\s>
<s> i think the directors are beginning to realise that sir <\s>
<s> i know you hold very strong views sir and it's always your habit to look things in the face but i don't think the directors like it sir now they they see it <\s>
<s> grimly nor you it seems <\s>

<s> i know from my own father sir that when you get on in life you do feel things dreadfully anthony <\s>

<s> tench nervously rings the bell and stands by the fire tench <\s>
<s> excuse me for saying such a thing <\s>
<s> i was only thinking of you sir <\s>
<s> frost enters from the hall he comes to the foot of the table and looks at anthony tench coveys his nervousness by arranging papers anthony <\s>

<s> anthony shakes his head <\s>
<s> frost goes to the sideboard and prepares the drink tench <\s>
<s> in a low voice almost supplicating if you could see your way sir it would be a great relief to my mind it would indeed <\s>
<s> he looks up at anthony who has not moved it does make me so very anxious <\s>
<s> i haven't slept properly for weeks sir and that's a fact <\s>
<s> anthony looks in his face then slowly shakes his head disheartened no sir <\s>
<s> he goes on arranging papers frost places the whiskey and salver and puts it down by anthony's right hand <\s>
<s> he stands away looking gravely at anthony frost <\s>
<s> nothing i can get you sir <\s>
<s> anthony shakes his head you're aware sir of what the doctor said sir <\s>
<s> frost suddenly moves closer to him and speaks in a low voice frost <\s>
<s> this strike sir puttin all this strain on you <\s>
<s> excuse me sir is it is it worth it sir <\s>
<s> anthony mutters some words that are inaudible very good sir <\s>
<s> he turns and goes out into the hall <\s>
<s> tench makes two attempts to speak but meeting his chairman's gaze he drops his eyes and turning dismally he too goes out <\s>
<s> anthony is left alone <\s>
<s> he grips the glass tilts it and drinks deeply then sets it down with a deep and rumbling sigh and leans back in his chair the curtain falls <\s>
<s> act ii scene i it is half past three <\s>
<s> in the kitchen of roberts's cottage a meagre little fire is burning <\s>
<s> the room is clean and tidy very barely furnished with a brick floor and white washed walls much stained with smoke <\s>
<s> there is a kettle on the fire <\s>
<s> a door opposite the fireplace opens inward from a snowy street <\s>
<s> on the wooden table are a cup and saucer a teapot knife and plate of bread and cheese <\s>
<s> close to the fireplace in an old arm chair wrapped in a rug sits mrs <\s>
<s> roberts a thin and dark haired woman about thirty five with patient eyes <\s>
<s> her hair is not done up but tied back with a piece of ribbon <\s>
<s> by the fire too is mrs <\s>

<s> when he talks it's the devil that comes into them <\s>
<s> roberts makes a movement of pain ah <\s>
<s> you don't want him beaten <\s>
<s> with everybody like their own shadows <\s>
<s> she makes a gesture towards mrs <\s>
<s> roberts if rous wants me he must give up roberts <\s>
<s> if he gave him up they all would <\s>
<s> they're only waiting for a lead <\s>
<s> father's against him they're all against him in their hearts <\s>
<s> you won't beat roberts <\s>
<s> they look silently at each other madge <\s>
<s> the cowards when their own mothers and their own children don't know where to turn <\s>
<s> looking searchingly at mrs <\s>
<s> roberts i wonder he can look you in the face <\s>
<s> she squats before the fire with her hands out to the flame harness is here again <\s>
<s> they'll have to make up their minds to day <\s>
<s> in a soft slow voice with a slight west country burr roberts will never give up the furnace men and engineers <\s>
<s> t wouldn't be right <\s>
<s> you can't deceive me <\s>
<s> it's just his pride <\s>
<s> a tapping at the door is heard the women turn as enid enters <\s>

<s> i call that really wicked of you <\s>
<s> thank you m'm i'd no need for it <\s>
<s> it was roberts's doing wasn't it <\s>
<s> how can he let all this suffering go on amongst you <\s>
<s> surprised i beg your pardon <\s>
<s> who said there was suffering <\s>
<s> throwing her shawl over her head please to let us keep ourselves to ourselves <\s>
<s> we don't want you coming here and spying on us <\s>
<s> confronting her but without rising i did n't speak to you <\s>
<s> in a low fierce voice keep your kind feelings to yourself <\s>
<s> you think you can come amongst us but you're mistaken <\s>
<s> go back and tell the manager that <\s>
<s> stonily this is not your house <\s>
<s> turning to the door no it is not my house keep clear of my house mrs <\s>
<s> enid taps her fingers on the table mrs <\s>
<s> please to forgive madge thomas m'm she's a bit upset to day <\s>
<s> looking at her oh i think they're so stupid all of them <\s>
<s> with a faint smile <\s>
<s> it is his doing that they don't come to an agreement <\s>
<s> now is n't it annie <\s>
<s> softly with her eyes on enid and moving the fingers of one hand continually on her breast they do say that your father m'm enid <\s>
<s> my father's getting an old man and you know what old men are <\s>
<s> i am sorry m'm <\s>
<s> more softly i don't expect you to feel sorry annie <\s>
<s> i know it's his fault as well as roberts's <\s>
<s> i'm sorry for any one that gets old m'm it s dreadful to get old and mr <\s>
<s> anthony was such a fine old man i always used to think <\s>
<s> impulsively he always liked you don't you remember <\s>
<s> look here annie what can i do <\s>
<s> i do so want to know <\s>
<s> you don't get what you ought to have <\s>
<s> going to the fire she takes the kettle off and looks for coals and you're so naughty sending back the soup and things <\s>
<s> with a faint smile yes m'm <\s>
<s> resentfully why you have n't even got coals <\s>
<s> if you please m'm to put the kettle on again roberts won't have long for his tea when he comes in <\s>
<s> he's got to meet the men at four <\s>
<s> putting the kettle on that means he'll lash them into a fury again <\s>
<s> can't you stop his going annie <\s>
<s> roberts smiles ironically have you tried <\s>
<s> a silence does he know how ill you are <\s>
<s> it's only my weak eard m'm <\s>
<s> you used to be so well when you were with us <\s>
<s> stiffening roberts is always good to me <\s>
<s> but you ought to have everything you want and you have nothing <\s>
<s> appealingly they tell me i don't look like a dyin woman <\s>
<s> of course you don't if you could only have proper will you see my doctor if i send him to you <\s>
<s> i'm sure he'd do you good <\s>
<s> with faint questioning yes m'm <\s>
<s> madge thomas ought n't to come here she only excites you <\s>
<s> as if i did n't know what suffering there is amongst the men <\s>
<s> i do feel for them dreadfully but you know they have gone too far <\s>
<s> continually moving her fingers they say there's no other way to get better wages m'm <\s>
<s> earnestly but annie that's why the union won't help them <\s>
<s> my husband's very sympathetic with the men but he says they are not underpaid <\s>
<s> they never think how the company could go on if we paid the wages they want <\s>
<s> with an effort but the dividends having been so big m'm <\s>
<s> takes aback you all seem to think the shareholders are rich men but they're not most of them are really no better off than working men <\s>
<s> roberts smiles they have to keep up appearances <\s>
<s> you don't have to pay rates and taxes and a hundred other things that they do <\s>
<s> if the men did n't spend such a lot in drink and betting they'd be quite well off <\s>
<s> they say workin so hard they must have some pleasure <\s>
<s> but surely not low pleasure like that <\s>
<s> a little resentfully roberts never touches a drop and he's never had a bet in his life <\s>
<s> but he's not a com  i mean he's an engineer a superior man <\s>
<s> roberts says they've no chance of other pleasures <\s>
<s> musing of course i know it's hard <\s>
<s> with a spice of malice and they say gentlefolk's just as bad <\s>
<s> with a smile i go as far as most people annie but you know yourself that's nonsense <\s>
<s> with painful effort a lot o the men never go near the public but even they don't save but very little and that goes if there's illness <\s>
<s> but they've got their clubs have n't they <\s>
<s> the clubs only give up to eighteen shillin's a week m'm and it's not much amongst a family <\s>
<s> roberts says workin folk have always lived from hand to mouth <\s>
<s> sixpence to day is worth more than a shillin to morrow that's what they say <\s>
<s> but that's the spirit of gambling <\s>
<s> with a sort of excitement roberts says a working man's life is all a gamble from the time e s born to the time e dies <\s>
<s> enid leans forward interested <\s>
<s> roberts goes on with a growing excitement that culminates in the personal feeling of the last words he says m'm that when a working man's baby is born it's a toss up from breath to breath whether it ever draws another and so on all is life an when he comes to be old it's the workhouse or the grave <\s>
<s> he says that without a man is very near and pinches and stints imself and is children to save there can't be neither surplus nor security <\s>
<s> that's why he wouldn't have no children she sinks back not though i wanted them <\s>
<s> yes yes i know <\s>
<s> no you don't m'm <\s>
<s> you've got your children and you'll never need to trouble for them <\s>
<s> gently you oughtn't to be talking so much annie <\s>
<s> then in spite of herself but roberts was paid a lot of money was n't he for discovering that process <\s>
<s> on the defensive all roberts's savin's have gone <\s>
<s> he s always looked forward to this strike <\s>
<s> he says he's no right to a farthing when the others are suffering <\s>
<s> t is n't so with all o them <\s>
<s> some don't seem to care no more than that so long as they get their own <\s>
<s> i don't see how they can be expected to when they re suffering like this <\s>
<s> in a changed voice but roberts ought to think of you <\s>
<s> shall i make the tea <\s>
<s> she takes the teapot and seeing tea there pours water into it won't you have a cup <\s>
<s> no thank you m'm <\s>
<s> she is listening as though for footsteps i'd sooner you did n't see roberts m'm he gets so wild <\s>
<s> but i must annie i'll be quite calm i promise <\s>
<s> it's life an death to him m'm <\s>
<s> very gently i'll get him to talk to me outside we won't excite you <\s>
<s> she gives a violent start <\s>
<s> roberts has come in unseen roberts <\s>
<s> removing his hat with subtle mockery beg pardon for coming in you're engaged with a lady i see <\s>
<s> can i speak to you mr <\s>
<s> whom have i the pleasure of addressing ma'am <\s>
<s> but surely you know me <\s>
<s> with a bow of malice the daughter of our chairman <\s>
<s> earnestly i've come on purpose to speak to you will you come outside a minute <\s>
<s> she looks at mrs <\s>
<s> hanging up his hat i have nothing to say ma'am <\s>
<s> but i must speak to you please <\s>
<s> she moves towards the door roberts <\s>
<s> with sudden venom i have not the time to listen <\s>
<s> taking off his overcoat i am sorry to disoblige a lady mr <\s>
<s> wavering then with sudden decision mr <\s>
<s> roberts i know you've another meeting of the men <\s>
<s> roberts bows i came to appeal to you <\s>
<s> please please try to come to some compromise give way a little if it's only for your own sakes <\s>
<s> speaking to himself the daughter of mr <\s>
<s> anthony begs me to give way a little if it's only for our own sakes <\s>
<s> for everybody's sake for your wife's sake <\s>
<s> for my wife's sake for everybody's sake for the sake of mr <\s>
<s> why are you so bitter against my father <\s>
<s> he has never done anything to you <\s>
<s> he can't help his views any more than you can help yours <\s>
<s> i really did n't know that i had a right to views <\s>
<s> he's an old man and you seeing his eyes fixed on her she stops roberts <\s>
<s> without raising his voice if i saw mr <\s>
<s> anthony going to die and i could save him by lifting my hand i would not lift the little finger of it <\s>
<s> you you she stops again biting her lips roberts <\s>
<s> i would not and that's flat <\s>
<s> coldly you don't mean what you say and you know it <\s>
<s> i mean every word of it <\s>
<s> with a flash mr <\s>
<s> anthony stands for tyranny <\s>
<s> roberts makes a movement as if to rise but sinks back in her chair enid <\s>
<s> with an impetuous movement annie <\s>
<s> please not to touch my wife <\s>
<s> recoiling with a sort of horror i believe you are mad <\s>
<s> the house of a madman then is not the fit place for a lady <\s>
<s> i m not afraid of you <\s>
<s> bowing i would not expect the daughter of mr <\s>
<s> anthony to be afraid <\s>
<s> anthony is not a coward like the rest of them <\s>
<s> suddenly i suppose you think it brave then to go on with the struggle <\s>
<s> anthony think it brave to fight against women and children <\s>
<s> anthony is a rich man i believe does he think it brave to fight against those who have n't a penny <\s>
<s> does he think it brave to set children crying with hunger an women shivering with cold <\s>
<s> putting up her hand as though warding off a blow my father is acting on his principles and you know it <\s>
<s> and so am i <\s>
<s> you hate us and you can't bear to be beaten <\s>
<s> anthony for all that he may say <\s>
<s> at any rate you might have pity on your wife <\s>
<s> roberts who has her hand pressed to her heart takes it away and tries to calm her breathing roberts <\s>
<s> madam i have no more to say <\s>
<s> he takes up the loaf <\s>
<s> there is a knock at the door and underwood comes in <\s>
<s> he stands looking at them enid turns to him then seems undecided underwood <\s>
<s> ironically ye were not needing to come for your wife mr <\s>

<s> if we can shake passionately that white faced monster with the bloody lips that has sucked the life out of ourselves our wives and children since the world began <\s>
<s> dropping the note of passion but with the utmost weight and intensity if we have not the hearts of men to stand against it breast to breast and eye to eye and force it backward till it cry for mercy it will go on sucking life and we shall stay forever what we are in almost a whisper less than the very dogs <\s>

<s> the double doors are opened and anthony comes slowly in he passes his daughter and lowers himself into an arm chair <\s>

<s> anthony makes a gesture but does not speak who was it <\s>
<s> anthony does not answer <\s>
<s> enid going to the double doors meets edgar coming in <\s>
<s> they speak together in low tones what is it ted <\s>

<s> what did he say <\s>
<s> said father was too old and feeble to know what he was doing <\s>
<s> the dad's worth six of him <\s>
<s> of course he is <\s>
<s> they look at anthony the doors open wider wanklin appears with scantlebury scantlebury <\s>
<s> sotto voce i don't like the look of this <\s>
<s> going forward come chairman <\s>
<s> wilder sends you his apologies <\s>
<s> a man can't do more <\s>
<s> wilder followed by tench comes in and goes to anthony wilder <\s>
<s> glumly i withdraw my words sir <\s>
<s> anthony nods to him enid <\s>
<s> you have n't come to a decision mr <\s>
<s> wanklin shakes his head wanklin <\s>
<s> we're all here chairman what do you say <\s>
<s> shall we get on with the business or shall we go back to the other room <\s>
<s> yes yes let's get on <\s>
<s> we must settle something <\s>
<s> he turns from a small chair and settles himself suddenly in the largest chair with a sigh of comfort wilder and wanklin also sit and tench drawing up a straight backed chair close to his chairman sits on the edge of it with the minute book and a stylographic pen enid <\s>
<s> whispering i want to speak to you a minute ted <\s>
<s> they go out through the double doors wanklin <\s>
<s> really chairman it's no use soothing ourselves with a sense of false security <\s>
<s> if this strike's not brought to an end before the general meeting the shareholders will certainly haul us over the coals <\s>
<s> i know it for a fact <\s>
<s> and get turned out <\s>
<s> to anthony i don't mind martyrdom for a policy in which i believe but i object to being burnt for some one else's principles <\s>
<s> very reasonable you must see that chairman <\s>
<s> we owe it to other employers to stand firm <\s>
<s> there's a limit to that <\s>
<s> you were all full of fight at the start <\s>
<s> with a sort of groan we thought the men would give in but they have n't <\s>
<s> rising and pacing up and down i can't have my reputation as a man of business destroyed for the satisfaction of starving the men out <\s>
<s> almost in tears i can't have it <\s>
<s> how can we meet the shareholders with things in the state they are <\s>
<s> lashing himself if any one expects me to say to them i've lost you fifty thousand pounds and sooner than put my pride in my pocket i'll lose you another <\s>
<s> glancing at anthony it's it's unnatural <\s>
<s> i don't want to go against you sir <\s>
<s> persuasively come chairman we re not free agents <\s>
<s> we're part of a machine <\s>
<s> our only business is to see the company earns as much profit as it safely can <\s>
<s> if you blame me for want of principle i say that we're trustees <\s>
<s> reason tells us we shall never get back in the saving of wages what we shall lose if we continue this struggle really chairman we must bring it to an end on the best terms we can make <\s>
<s> there is a pause of general dismay wilder <\s>
<s> it's a deadlock then <\s>
<s> letting his hands drop with a sort of despair now i shall never get off to spain <\s>
<s> retaining a trace of irony you hear the consequences of your victory chairman <\s>
<s> with a burst of feeling my wife's ill <\s>
<s> you don't say so <\s>

<s> through the double doors edgar comes in looking very grave edgar <\s>
<s> to his father have you heard this sir <\s>
<s> every one stages at him as if trying to gauge the importance of this news enid saw her this afternoon she had no coals or food or anything <\s>
<s> there is a silence every one avoiding the other's eyes except anthony who stares hard at his son scantlebury <\s>
<s> you don't suggest that we could have helped the poor thing <\s>
<s> flustered the woman was in bad health <\s>
<s> nobody can say there's any responsibility on us <\s>
<s> at least not on me <\s>
<s> hotly i say that we are responsible <\s>
<s> it not infrequently happens that women are the greatest sufferers <\s>
<s> if we knew that all the more responsibility rests on us <\s>
<s> this is no matter for amateurs <\s>
<s> call me what you like sir <\s>
<s> we had no right to carry things to such a length <\s>
<s> i don't like this business a bit that radical rag will twist it to their own ends see if they don't <\s>
<s> they'll get up some cock and bull story about the poor woman's dying from starvation <\s>
<s> i wash my hands of it <\s>
<s> none of us can <\s>
<s> striking his fist on the arm of his chair but i protest against this <\s>
<s> protest as you like mr <\s>
<s> scantlebury it won't alter facts <\s>
<s> facing him angrily no sir <\s>
<s> i tell you exactly what i think <\s>
<s> if we pretend the men are not suffering it's humbug and if they're suffering we know enough of human nature to know the women are suffering more and as to the children well it's damnable <\s>
<s> scantlebury rises from his chair i don't say that we meant to be cruel i don't say anything of the sort but i do say it's criminal to shut our eyes to the facts <\s>
<s> we employ these men and we can't get out of it <\s>
<s> i don't care so much about the men but i'd sooner resign my position on the board than go on starving women in this way <\s>
<s> all except anthony are now upon their feet anthony sits grasping the arms of his chair and staring at his son scantlebury <\s>
<s> i don't i don't like the way you're putting it young sir <\s>
<s> you're rather overshooting the mark <\s>
<s> i should think so indeed <\s>
<s> losing control it's no use blinking things <\s>
<s> if you want to have the death of women on your hands i don't <\s>
<s> now now young man <\s>
<s> not on mine i won't have it <\s>
<s> we are five members of this board if we were four against it why did we let it drift till it came to this <\s>
<s> you know perfectly well why because we hoped we should starve the men out <\s>
<s> well all we've done is to starve one woman out <\s>
<s> almost hysterically i protest i protest <\s>
<s> i'm a humane man we're all humane men <\s>
<s> scornfully there's nothing wrong with our humanity <\s>
<s> it's our imaginations mr <\s>
<s> my imagination's as good as yours <\s>
<s> if so it is n't good enough <\s>
<s> then why didn't you put your foot down <\s>
<s> much good that would have done <\s>
<s> he looks at anthony edgar <\s>
<s> if you and i and each one of us here who say that our imaginations are so good scantlebury <\s>
<s> flurried i never said so <\s>
<s> paying no attention had put our feet down the thing would have been ended long ago and this poor woman's life wouldn't have been crushed out of her like this <\s>
<s> for all we can tell there may be a dozen other starving women <\s>
<s> for god's sake sir don't use that word at a at a board meeting it's it's monstrous <\s>
<s> i will use it mr <\s>
<s> then i shall not listen to you <\s>
<s> i shall not listen <\s>
<s> it's painful to me <\s>
<s> he covers his ears wanklin <\s>
<s> none of us are opposed to a settlement except your father <\s>
<s> i'm certain that if the shareholders knew wanklin <\s>
<s> i don't think you'll find their imaginations are any better than ours <\s>
<s> because a woman happens to have a weak heart edgar <\s>
<s> a struggle like this finds out the weak spots in everybody <\s>
<s> any child knows that <\s>
<s> if it hadn't been for this cut throat policy she need n't have died like this and there would n't be all this misery that any one who is n't a fool can see is going on <\s>
<s> throughout the foregoing anthony has eyed his son he now moves as though to rise but stops as edgar speaks again i don't defend the men or myself or anybody <\s>
<s> you may have to <\s>
<s> a coroner's jury of disinterested sympathisers may say some very nasty things <\s>
<s> we mustn't lose sight of our position <\s>
<s> without uncovering his ears coroner's jury <\s>
<s> no no it's not a case for that <\s>
<s> i ve had enough of cowardice <\s>
<s> cowardice is an unpleasant word mr <\s>
<s> it will look very like cowardice if we suddenly concede the men's demands when a thing like this happens we must be careful <\s>
<s> of course we must <\s>
<s> we've no knowledge of this matter except a rumour <\s>
<s> the proper course is to put the whole thing into the hands of harness to settle for us that's natural that's what we should have come to any way <\s>
<s> turning to edgar and as to you young sir i can't sufficiently express my my distaste for the way you've treated the whole matter <\s>
<s> you ought to withdraw <\s>
<s> talking of starvation talking of cowardice <\s>
<s> considering what our views are <\s>
<s> except your own is is one of goodwill it's most irregular it's most improper and all i can say is it's it's given me pain he places his hand over his heart edgar <\s>
<s> stubbornly i withdraw nothing <\s>
<s> he is about to say mote when scantlebury once more coveys up his ears <\s>
<s> tench suddenly makes a demonstration with the minute book <\s>
<s> a sense of having been engaged in the unusual comes over all of them and one by one they resume their seats <\s>
<s> edgar alone remains on his feet wilder <\s>
<s> with an air of trying to wipe something out i pay no attention to what young mr <\s>
<s> i i move this amendment to the chairman's motion that the dispute be placed at once in the hands of mr <\s>
<s> simon harness for settlement on the lines indicated by him this morning <\s>
<s> any one second that <\s>
<s> tench writes in his book wanklin <\s>
<s> very well then i ask the chairman to put it to the board <\s>
<s> with a great sigh slowly we have been made the subject of an attack <\s>
<s> looking round at wilder and scantlebury with ironical contempt i take it on my shoulders <\s>
<s> i am seventy six years old <\s>
<s> i have been chairman of this company since its inception two and thirty years ago <\s>
<s> i have seen it pass through good and evil report <\s>
<s> my connection with it began in the year that this young man was born <\s>
<s> edgar bows his head <\s>
<s> anthony gripping his chair goes on i have had do to with men for fifty years i've always stood up to them i have never been beaten yet <\s>
<s> i have fought the men of this company four times and four times i have beaten them <\s>
<s> it has been said that i am not the man i was <\s>
<s> he looks at wilder however that may be i am man enough to stand to my guns <\s>
<s> his voice grows stronger <\s>
<s> the double doors are opened <\s>
<s> enid slips in followed by underwood who restrains her the men have been treated justly they have had fair wages we have always been ready to listen to complaints <\s>
<s> it has been said that times have changed if they have i have not changed with them <\s>
<s> it has been said that masters and men are equal <\s>
<s> there can only be one master in a house <\s>
<s> where two men meet the better man will rule <\s>
<s> it has been said that capital and labour have the same interests <\s>
<s> their interests are as wide asunder as the poles <\s>
<s> it has been said that the board is only part of a machine <\s>
<s> we are the machine its brains and sinews it is for us to lead and to determine what is to be done and to do it without fear or favour <\s>
<s> fear of the men <\s>
<s> fear of the shareholders <\s>
<s> fear of our own shadows <\s>
<s> before i am like that i hope to die <\s>
<s> he pauses and meeting his son's eyes goes on there is only one way of treating men with the iron hand <\s>
<s> this half and half business the half and half manners of this generation has brought all this upon us <\s>
<s> sentiment and softness and what this young man no doubt would call his social policy <\s>
<s> you can't eat cake and have it <\s>

<s> no of course not only nodding towards joan and mable <\s>
<s> this is just an instance of what i hate <\s>
<s> yes mother and don't you pretend you don't understand because you know you do <\s>
<s> joan and mabel have ceased talking and listen still at the fire <\s>
<s> why should you want them to marry if he's tired of her <\s>
<s> if your imagination doesn't carry you as far as that <\s>
<s> when people marry do you believe they ought to be in love with each other <\s>

<s> i don't agree a bit john <\s>
<s> of course if you won't listen <\s>
<s> clipping a cigar draw it mild my dear chap <\s>
<s> we've had the whole thing over twice at least <\s>
<s> my point is this keith <\s>
<s> regarding latter quizzically with his halfclosed eyes i know i know but the point is how far your point is simply professional <\s>
<s> if a man wrongs a woman he ought to right her again <\s>
<s> there's no answer to that <\s>
<s> hang it john one can't argue this out with a parson <\s>
<s> who has entered from the dining room pull devil pull baker <\s>
<s> to play the game is the religion even of the army <\s>

<s> what else can it be in this case <\s>
<s> you're too puritanical young john <\s>
<s> you can't help it line of country laid down for you <\s>
<s> with concentration look here <\s>
<s> imitating the action of a man pulling at a horse's head come hup i say you hugly beast <\s>
<s> to latter you're not going to draw me old chap <\s>
<s> you don't see where you'd land us all <\s>
<s> he smokes calmly latter <\s>
<s> how do you imagine vice takes its rise <\s>
<s> from precisely this sort of thing of young dunning's <\s>
<s> from human nature i should have thought john <\s>
<s> i admit that i don't like a fellow's leavin a girl in the lurch but i don't see the use in drawin hard and fast rules <\s>
<s> you only have to break em <\s>
<s> sir william and you would just tie dunning and the girl up together willy nilly to save appearances and ten to one but there'll be the deuce to pay in a year's time <\s>
<s> you can take a horse to the water you can't make him drink <\s>
<s> i entirely and absolutely disagree with you <\s>

<s> harold turns up his eyes and points downwards dry up harold <\s>
<s> did you ever hear the story of faust <\s>

<s> well i must say ronny of all the rude boors he turns towards the billiard room keith <\s>
<s> sorry i smashed the glass old chap <\s>
<s> there comes a mingled sound through the opened door of female voices laughter and the click of billiard balls dipped of by the sudden closing of the door <\s>
<s> impersonally deuced odd the way a parson puts one's back up <\s>
<s> because you know i agree with him really young dunning ought to play the game and i hope sir william'll make him <\s>
<s> the butler jackson has entered from the door under the stairs followed by the keeper studdenham a man between fifty and sixty in a full skirted coat with big pockets cord breeches and gaiters he has a steady self respecting weathered face with blue eyes and a short grey beard which has obviously once been red <\s>
<s> touching his forehead evenin captain keith <\s>

<s> won't say other than that he don't want no more to do with her <\s>
<s> that's not a reason <\s>
<s> i can't have a keeper of mine playing fast and loose in the village like this <\s>

<s> i'm so sorry studdenham <\s>
<s> respectfully fancy he's got a feeling she's not his equal now my lady <\s>
<s> to herself yes i suppose he has made her his superior <\s>
<s> i was just telling studdenham the fellow must set the matter straight <\s>
<s> we can't have open scandals in the village <\s>

<s> to her husband in a low voice is it right to force them <\s>
<s> do you know what the girl wishes studdenham <\s>
<s> shows a spirit my lady says she'll have him willin or not <\s>
<s> if they marry like that they're sure to be miserable <\s>
<s> doesn't follow at all <\s>
<s> besides my dear you ought to know by this time there's an unwritten law in these matters <\s>
<s> they're perfectly well aware that when there are consequences they have to take them <\s>
<s> some o these young people my lady they don't put two and two together no more than an old cock pheasant <\s>

<s> bill who has sauntered moody from the diningroom stands by the stairs listening <\s>
<s> catching sight of him dunning raises his hand to his forelock <\s>
<s> very good sir william <\s>
<s> he turns fumbles and turns again my old mother's dependent on me sir william <\s>
<s> now dunning i've no more to say <\s>
<s> dunning goes sadly away under the stairs sir william <\s>
<s> following and look here <\s>
<s> just understand this he too goes out .... bill lighting a cigarette has approached the writing table <\s>
<s> he looks very glum <\s>
<s> the billiard room door is flung open <\s>
<s> mabel lanfarne appears and makes him a little curtsey <\s>
<s> against my will i am bidden to bring you in to pool <\s>
<s> you seem to have become very conscientious <\s>
<s> do you remember the last day of the covert shooting <\s>
<s> suddenly what a pretty girl freda studdenham's grown <\s>
<s> she walks in beauty <\s>
<s> have you been taking lessons in conversation <\s>
<s> there is a silence mr <\s>
<s> what's the matter with you <\s>
<s> aren't you rather queer considering that i don't bite and was rather a pal <\s>
<s> then seeing that his mother has came in from the billiard room he sits down at the writing table <\s>
<s> mabel dear do take my cue <\s>
<s> won't you play too bill and try and stop ronny he's too terrible <\s>
<s> i've got these letters <\s>
<s> mabel taking the cue passes back into the billiard room whence comes out the sound of talk and laughter <\s>
<s> going over and standing behind her son's chair anything wrong darling <\s>
<s> suddenly i say i wish you hadn't asked that girl here <\s>
<s> she's wanted for rehearsals <\s>
<s> i thought you got on so well with her last christmas <\s>
<s> with a sort of sullen exasperation a year ago <\s>
<s> the girls like her so does your father personally i must say i think she's rather nice and irish <\s>
<s> she's all right i daresay <\s>
<s> he looks round as if to show his mother that he wishes to be left alone <\s>
<s> but lady cheshire having seen that he is about to look at her is not looking at him <\s>
<s> i'm afraid your father's been talking to you bill <\s>
<s> do try and make allowances <\s>
<s> with a faint smile of course he is a little bill <\s>
<s> i wish i could bill <\s>
<s> don't you get mixed up in it <\s>
<s> it seems almost a pity that you told him <\s>
<s> he wrote and asked me point blank what i owed <\s>
<s> forcing herself to speak in a casual voice i happen to have a little money bill i think it would be simpler if bill <\s>
<s> now look here mother you've tried that before <\s>
<s> i can't help spending money i never shall be able unless i go to the colonies or something of the kind <\s>
<s> don't talk like that dear <\s>
<s> i would for two straws <\s>
<s> it's only because your father thinks such a lot of the place and the name and your career <\s>
<s> the cheshires are all like that <\s>
<s> they've been here so long they're all root <\s>
<s> deuced funny business my career will be i expect <\s>
<s> fluttering but restraining herself lest he should see but bill why must you spend more than your allowance <\s>
<s> i didn't make myself <\s>
<s> i'm afraid we did that <\s>
<s> it was inconsiderate perhaps <\s>
<s> yes you'd better have left me out <\s>
<s> but why are you so only a little fuss about money <\s>
<s> you're not keeping anything from me are you <\s>
<s> he then turns very deliberately to the writing things and takes up a pen i must write these letters please <\s>
<s> bill if there's any real trouble you will tell me won't you <\s>
<s> he suddenly gets up and walks about <\s>
<s> lady cheshire too moves over to the fireplace and after an uneasy look at him turns to the fire <\s>
<s> then as if trying to switch of his mood she changes the subject abruptly <\s>
<s> isn't it a pity about young dunning <\s>
<s> i'm so sorry for rose taylor <\s>
<s> there is a silence <\s>
<s> stealthily under the staircase freda has entered and seeing only bill advances to speak to him <\s>
<s> well you can't help these things in the country <\s>
<s> as he speaks freda stops dead perceiving that he is not alone bill too catching sight of her starts <\s>
<s> still speaking to the fire it seems dreadful to force him <\s>
<s> i do so believe in people doing things of their own accord <\s>
<s> then seeing freda standing so uncertainly by the stairs do you want me freda <\s>
<s> only your cloak my lady <\s>
<s> at this moment sir william enters from the drawing room <\s>
<s> genially can you give me another five minutes bill <\s>
<s> pointing to the billiard room we'll come directly my dear <\s>
<s> freda with a look at bill has gone back whence she came and lady cheshire goes reluctantly away into the billiard room <\s>
<s> i shall give young dunning short shrift <\s>
<s> he moves over to the fireplace and divides hip coat tails now about you bill <\s>
<s> i don't want to bully you the moment you come down but you know this can't go on <\s>
<s> i've paid your debts twice <\s>
<s> shan't pay them this time unless i see a disposition to change your mode of life <\s>
<s> a pause you get your extravagance from your mother <\s>
<s> she's very queer a pause all the winterleighs are like that about money .... <\s>
<s> mother's particularly generous if that's what you mean <\s>
<s> drily we will put it that way <\s>
<s> a pause at the present moment you owe as i understand it eleven hundred pounds <\s>
<s> a pause i've a proposition to make <\s>
<s> won't it do to morrow sir <\s>
<s> to morrow appears to be your motto in life <\s>
<s> i'm anxious to change it to day <\s>
<s> bill looks at him in silence it's time you took your position seriously instead of hanging about town racing and playing polo and what not <\s>
<s> at something dangerous in his voice sir william modifies his attitude <\s>
<s> the proposition's very simple <\s>
<s> i can't suppose anything so rational and to your advantage will appeal to you but drily i mention it <\s>
<s> marry a nice girl settle down and stand for the division you can have the dower house and fifteen hundred a year and i'll pay your debts into the bargain <\s>
<s> if you're elected i'll make it two thousand <\s>
<s> plenty of time to work up the constituency before we kick out these infernal rads <\s>
<s> carpetbagger against you if you go hard at it in the summer it'll be odd if you don't manage to get in your three days a week next season <\s>
<s> you can take rocketer and that four year old he's well up to your weight fully eight and a half inches of bone <\s>
<s> you'll only want one other <\s>
<s> and if miss if your wife means to hunt bill <\s>
<s> you've chosen my wife then <\s>
<s> with a quick look i imagine you've some girl in your mind <\s>
<s> sir william used not to be unnatural at your age <\s>
<s> i married your mother at twenty eight <\s>
<s> here you are eldest son of a family that stands for something <\s>
<s> the more i see of the times the more i'm convinced that everybody who is anybody has got to buckle to and save the landmarks left <\s>
<s> unless we're true to our caste and prepared to work for it the landed classes are going to go under to this infernal democratic spirit in the air <\s>
<s> the outlook's very serious <\s>
<s> we're threatened in a hundred ways <\s>
<s> if you mean business you'll want a wife <\s>
<s> when i came into the property i should have been lost without your mother <\s>
<s> i thought this was coming <\s>
<s> with a certain geniality my dear fellow i don't want to put a pistol to your head <\s>
<s> you've had a slack rein so far <\s>
<s> i've never objected to your sowing a few wild oats so long as you er unseen by sir william bill makes a sudden movement short of that at all events i've not inquired into your affairs <\s>
<s> i can only judge by the er pecuniary evidence you've been good enough to afford me from time to time <\s>
<s> i imagine you've lived like a good many young men in your position i'm not blaming you but there's a time for all things <\s>
<s> why don't you say outright that you want me to marry mabel lanfarne <\s>
<s> girl's a nice one <\s>
<s> good family got a little money rides well <\s>
<s> isn't she good looking enough for you or what <\s>
<s> i understood from your mother that you and she were on good terms <\s>
<s> please don't drag mother into it <\s>
<s> with dangerous politeness perhaps you'll be good enough to state your objections <\s>
<s> must we go on with this <\s>
<s> i've never asked you to do anything for me before i expect you to pay attention now <\s>
<s> i've no wish to dragoon you into this particular marriage <\s>
<s> if you don't care for miss lanfarne marry a girl you're fond of <\s>
<s> in that case you know what to look out for <\s>
<s> with a sudden rush of choler you young .... <\s>
<s> he checks himself and stands glaring at bill who glares back at him this means i suppose that you've got some entanglement or other <\s>
<s> suppose what you like sir <\s>
<s> i warn you if you play the blackguard bill <\s>
<s> you can't force me like young dunning <\s>
<s> hearing the raised voices lady cheshire has come back from the billiard room <\s>
<s> closing the door what is it <\s>
<s> resolutely i haven't seen bill for two months <\s>
<s> hesitating well we must talk it over again <\s>
<s> come to the billiard room both of you <\s>
<s> bill do finish those letters <\s>
<s> with a deft movement she draws sir william toward the billiard room and glances back at bill before going out but he has turned to the writing table <\s>
<s> when the door is closed bill looks into the drawing room them opens the door under the stairs and backing away towards the writing table sits down there and takes up a pen <\s>
<s> freda who has evidently been waiting comes in and stands by the table <\s>
<s> i say this is dangerous you know <\s>
<s> well then with natural recklessness aren't you going to kiss me <\s>
<s> without moving she looks at him with a sort of miserable inquiry <\s>
<s> do you know you haven't seen me for eight weeks <\s>
<s> quite long enough for you to have forgotten <\s>
<s> i don't forget people so soon <\s>
<s> what's the matter with you freda <\s>
<s> after a long look it'll never be as it was <\s>
<s> jumping up how d'you mean <\s>
<s> i've got something for you <\s>
<s> she takes a diamond ring out of her dress and holds it out to him i've not worn it since cromer <\s>
<s> now look here freda <\s>
<s> i've had my holiday i shan't get another in a hurry <\s>
<s> you'll be glad to be free <\s>
<s> that fortnight's all you really loved me in <\s>
<s> putting his hands on her arms i swear freda <\s>
<s> between her teeth miss lanfarne need never know about me <\s>
<s> i've told you a dozen times nothing's changed <\s>
<s> freda looks at him and smiles bill <\s>
<s> if you will make yourself miserable <\s>
<s> everybody will be pleased <\s>
<s> when you marry her <\s>
<s> this is too bad <\s>
<s> it's what always happens even when it's not a gentleman <\s>
<s> but i'm not like that girl down in the village <\s>
<s> you needn't be afraid i'll say anything when it comes <\s>
<s> that's what i had to tell you <\s>
<s> i can keep a secret <\s>
<s> do you mean this <\s>
<s> she bows her head bill <\s>
<s> father brought me up not to whine <\s>
<s> like the puppies when they hold them up by their tails <\s>
<s> with a sudden break in her voice oh <\s>
<s> with his head down seizing her hands freda <\s>
<s> he breaks away from her towards the fire good god <\s>
<s> she stands looking at him then quietly slips away by the door under the staircase <\s>
<s> bill turns to speak to her and sees that she has gone <\s>
<s> he walks up to the fireplace and grips the mantelpiece <\s>
<s> act ii the scene is lady cheshire's morning room at ten o'clock on the following day <\s>
<s> it is a pretty room with white panelled walls and chrysanthemums and carmine lilies in bowls <\s>
<s> a large bow window overlooks the park under a sou' westerly sky <\s>
<s> a piano stands open a fire is burning and the morning's correspondence is scattered on a writing table <\s>
<s> doors opposite each other lead to the maid's workroom and to a corridor <\s>
<s> lady cheshire is standing in the middle of the room looking at an opera cloak which freda is holding out <\s>
<s> well freda suppose you just give it up <\s>
<s> i don't like to be beaten <\s>
<s> you're not to worry over your work <\s>
<s> and by the way i promised your father to make you eat more <\s>
<s> freda smiles lady cheshire <\s>
<s> it's all very well to smile <\s>
<s> you want bracing up <\s>
<s> now don't be naughty <\s>
<s> i shall give you a tonic <\s>
<s> and i think you had better put that cloak away <\s>
<s> i'd rather have one more try my lady <\s>
<s> sitting doom at her writing table very well <\s>
<s> freda goes out into her workroom as jackson comes in from the corridor <\s>
<s> excuse me my lady <\s>
<s> there's a young woman from the village says you wanted to see her <\s>
<s> ask her to come in <\s>
<s> and jackson the car for the meet please at half past ten <\s>
<s> jackson having bowed and withdrawn lady cheshire rises with worked signs of nervousness which she has only just suppressed when rose taylor a stolid country girl comes in and stands waiting by the door <\s>
<s> rose advances perhaps a couple of steps lady cheshire <\s>
<s> i just wondered whether you'd like to ask my advice <\s>
<s> your engagement with dunning's broken off isn't it <\s>
<s> yes but i've told him he's got to marry me <\s>
<s> and you think that'll be the wisest thing <\s>
<s> stolidly i don't know my lady <\s>
<s> i do hope you're a little fond of him still <\s>
<s> he don't deserve it <\s>
<s> lady cheshire and do you think he's quite lost his affection for you <\s>
<s> i suppose so else he wouldn't treat me as he's done <\s>
<s> he's after that that he didn't ought to treat me as if i was dead <\s>
<s> but you will think it all well over won't you <\s>
<s> i've a got nothing to think over except what i know of <\s>
<s> but for you both t0 marry in that spirit <\s>
<s> you know it's for life rose <\s>
<s> looking into her face i'm always ready to help you <\s>
<s> dropping a very slight curtsey thank you my lady but i think he ought to marry me <\s>
<s> i've told him he ought <\s>
<s> sighing well that's all i wanted to say <\s>
<s> it's a question of your self respect i can't give you any real advice <\s>
<s> but just remember that if you want a friend rose <\s>
<s> with a gulp i'm not so ard really <\s>
<s> i only want him to do what's right by me <\s>
<s> with a little lift of her eyebrow gently yes yes i see <\s>
<s> glancing back at the door i don't like meeting the servants <\s>
<s> come along i'll take you out another way <\s>
<s> as they reach the door dot comes in dot <\s>
<s> with a glance at rose can we have this room for the mouldy rehearsal mother <\s>
<s> yes dear you can air it here <\s>
<s> holding the door open for rose she follows her out <\s>
<s> and dot with a book of caste in her hand arranges the room according to a diagram <\s>
<s> producing a pocket comb comb for eccles <\s>
<s> cradle cradle she viciously dumps a waste paper basket down and drops a footstool into it brat <\s>
<s> then reading from the book gloomily enter eccles breathless <\s>
<s> esther and polly rise esther puts on lid of bandbox <\s>
<s> searching for something to represent a bandbox she opens the workroom door <\s>
<s> you seem awfully down <\s>
<s> freda does not answer dot <\s>
<s> you haven't looked anything of a lollipop lately <\s>
<s> i'm quite all right thank you miss dot <\s>
<s> has mother been givin you a tonic <\s>
<s> smiling a little not yet <\s>
<s> that doesn't account for it then <\s>
<s> with a sudden warm impulse what is it freda <\s>
<s> switching of on a different line of thought are you very busy this morning <\s>
<s> only this cloak for my lady <\s>
<s> i may have to get you in to prompt if i can't keep em straight <\s>
<s> gloomily they stray so <\s>
<s> stolidly i shall be very glad miss dot <\s>
<s> eyeing her dubiously all right <\s>
<s> let's see what did i want <\s>
<s> joan has come in <\s>
<s> look here dot about the baby in this scene <\s>
<s> i'm sure i ought to make more of it <\s>
<s> she plucks the footstool out by one ear and holds it forth let's see you try <\s>
<s> recoiling but dot what are we really going to have for the baby <\s>
<s> i can't rehearse with that thing <\s>
<s> can't you suggest something freda <\s>
<s> borrow a real one miss joan <\s>
<s> there are some that don't count much <\s>
<s> dropping the footstool back into the basket you'll just put up with what you're given <\s>
<s> then as christine and mabel lanfarne come in freda turns abruptly and goes out <\s>
<s> where are bill and harold <\s>
<s> to joan go and find them mouse cat <\s>
<s> but bill and harold followed by latter are already in the doorway <\s>
<s> they come in and latter stumbling over the waste paper basket takes it up to improve its position <\s>
<s> drop that cradle john <\s>
<s> as he picks the footstool out of it leave the baby in <\s>
<s> bill you enter there <\s>
<s> she points to the workroom door where bill and mabel range themselves close to the piano while harold goes to the window john <\s>
<s> get off the stage <\s>
<s> now then eccles enters breathless esther and polly rise <\s>
<s> she opens the workroom door freda i wanted a bandbox <\s>
<s> cheerfully i hate beginning to rehearse you know you feel such a fool <\s>
<s> with her bandbox gloomily you'll feel more of a fool when you have begun <\s>
<s> to bill who is staring into the workroom shut the door <\s>
<s> bill shuts the door latter <\s>
<s> i want to clear up a point of psychology before we start <\s>
<s> when i bring in the milk ought i to bring it in seriously as if i were accustomed i mean i maintain that if i'm joan <\s>
<s> john but i don't think it's meant that you should dot <\s>
<s> turning round and again advancing but i think you underrate the importance of my entrance altogether <\s>
<s> i don't in the least want to destroy the balance of the scene but i do want to be clear about the spirit <\s>
<s> what is the spirit <\s>
<s> well i don't think so <\s>
<s> we shall run a great risk with this play if we rollick <\s>
<s> softly to bill mr <\s>
<s> desperately let's get on <\s>
<s> waving latter back begin begin <\s>
<s> but jackson has came in jackson <\s>
<s> to christine studdenham says mm if the young ladies want to see the spaniel pups he's brought em round <\s>
<s> she flies towards the door followed by latter dot <\s>
<s> gesticulating with her book stop <\s>
<s> you christine and harold also rush past dot <\s>
<s> tearing her hair pigs <\s>
<s> she rushes after them <\s>
<s> bill and mabel are left alone mabel <\s>
<s> mockingly and don't you want one of the spaniel pups <\s>
<s> painfully reserved and sullen and conscious of the workroom door can't keep a dog in town <\s>
<s> you can have one if you like <\s>
<s> the breeding's all right <\s>
<s> the girls'll give you one of theirs <\s>
<s> they only fancy they want em <\s>
<s> moving nearer to him with her hands clasped behind her you know you remind me awfully of your father <\s>
<s> except that you're not nearly so polite <\s>
<s> i don't understand you english lords of the soil <\s>
<s> the way you have of disposing of your females <\s>
<s> with a sudden change of voice what was the matter with you last night <\s>
<s> softly won't you tell me <\s>
<s> almost succumbing to her voice then sullenly worried i suppose <\s>
<s> returning to her mocking quite got over it <\s>
<s> don't chaff me please <\s>
<s> you really are rather formidable <\s>
<s> mabel but you know i love to cross a field where there's a bull <\s>
<s> the way of their only seeing one thing at a time <\s>
<s> she moves back as he advances and overturning people on the journey <\s>
<s> hadn't you better be a little careful <\s>
<s> and never to see the hedge until they're stuck in it <\s>
<s> and then straight from that hedge into the opposite one <\s>
<s> savagely what makes you bait me this morning of all mornings <\s>
<s> suddenly it must be dull for poor freda working in there with all this fun going on <\s>
<s> glancing at the door fun you call it <\s>
<s> mabel to go back to you now mr <\s>
<s> mabel you always make me feel so irish <\s>
<s> is it because you're so english d'you think <\s>
<s> i can see him moving his ears <\s>
<s> now he's pawing the ground he's started <\s>
<s> still backing away from him and drawing him on with her eyes and smile you can't help coming after me <\s>
<s> then with a sudden change to a sort of sierra gravity can you <\s>
<s> you'll feel that when i've gone <\s>
<s> they stand quite still looking into each other's eyes and freda who has opened the door of the workroom stares at them <\s>
<s> seeing her here's the stile <\s>
<s> adieu monsieur le taureau <\s>
<s> she puts her hand behind her opens the door and slips through leaving bill to turn following the direction of her eyes and see freda with the cloak still in her hand <\s>
<s> slowly walking towards her i haven't slept all night <\s>
<s> have you been thinking it over <\s>
<s> freda gives a bitter little laugh bill <\s>
<s> we must make a plan <\s>
<s> i'll get you away <\s>
<s> i won't let you suffer <\s>
<s> i swear i won't <\s>
<s> that will be clever <\s>
<s> i wish to heaven my affairs weren't in such a mess <\s>
<s> i shall be all right thank you <\s>
<s> you must think me a blackguard <\s>
<s> she shakes her head abuse me say something <\s>
<s> don't look like that <\s>
<s> were you ever really fond of me <\s>
<s> of course i was i am now <\s>
<s> give me your hands <\s>
<s> she looks at him then drags her hands from his and covers her face <\s>
<s> clenching his fists look here <\s>
<s> then as she suddenly flings her arms round his neck and clings to him there there <\s>
<s> there is a click of a door handle <\s>
<s> they start away from each other and see lady cheshire regarding them <\s>
<s> without irony i beg your pardon <\s>
<s> she makes as if to withdraw from an unwarranted intrusion but suddenly turning stands with lips pressed together waiting <\s>
<s> freda has muffled her face <\s>
<s> but bill turns and confronts his mother <\s>
<s> don't say anything against her <\s>
<s> tries to speak to him and fails then to freda please go <\s>
<s> taking freda's arm no <\s>
<s> lady cheshire after a moment's hesitation herself moves towards the door <\s>
<s> i think perhaps not <\s>
<s> looking at freda who is cowering as though from a blow it's a d  d shame <\s>
<s> with sudden resolution it's not as you think <\s>
<s> i'm engaged to be married to her <\s>
<s> freda gives him a wild stare and turns away lady cheshire <\s>
<s> looking from one to the other i don't think i quite understand <\s>
<s> with the brutality of his mortification what i said was plain enough <\s>
<s> i tell you i am going to marry her <\s>
<s> to freda is that true <\s>
<s> freda gulps and remains silent bill <\s>
<s> if you want to say anything say it to me mother <\s>
<s> gripping the edge of a little table give me a chair please <\s>
<s> bill gives her a chair lady cheshire <\s>
<s> to freda please sit down too <\s>
<s> freda sits on the piano stool still turning her face away <\s>
<s> fixing her eyes on freda now <\s>
<s> i fell in love with her <\s>
<s> and she with me <\s>
<s> it wasn't her fault <\s>
<s> with a sort of menace mother <\s>
<s> forgive me i am not quite used to the idea <\s>
<s> you say that you are engaged <\s>
<s> the reasons against such an engagement have occurred to you i suppose <\s>
<s> with a sudden change of tone bill <\s>
<s> what does it mean <\s>
<s> if you think she's trapped me into this lady cheshire <\s>
<s> neither do i think she has been trapped <\s>
<s> how long has this engagement lasted <\s>
<s> after a silence two months <\s>
<s> suddenly this is this is quite impossible <\s>
<s> you'll find it isn't <\s>
<s> pointing to the workroom go and wait in there freda <\s>
<s> quickly and are you still in love with her <\s>
<s> freda moving towards the workroom smothers a sob <\s>
<s> of course i am <\s>
<s> freda has gone and as she goes lady cheshire rises suddenly forced by the intense feeling she has been keeping in hand <\s>
<s> what does it all mean <\s>
<s> bill looking from side to aide only shrugs his shoulders you are not in love with her now <\s>
<s> it's no good telling me you are <\s>
<s> that's not exactly how you would speak if you were <\s>
<s> she's in love with me <\s>
<s> bitterly i suppose so <\s>
<s> i mean to see that nobody runs her down <\s>
<s> am i a hard or mean woman <\s>
<s> it's all your life and your father's and all of us <\s>

<s> if there weren't more than that to tell you'd be in love with her now <\s>
<s> i've told you that i am <\s>
<s> almost fiercely i know i know there's more behind <\s>
<s> baffled but unconvinced do you mean that your love for her has been just what it might have been for a lady <\s>
<s> with painful irony it is not so as a rule <\s>
<s> up to now i've never heard you or the girls say a word against freda <\s>
<s> this isn't the moment to begin please <\s>
<s> solemnly all such marriages end in wretchedness <\s>
<s> you haven't a taste or tradition in common <\s>
<s> you don't know what marriage is <\s>
<s> day after day year after year <\s>
<s> it's no use being sentimental for people brought up as we are to have different manners is worse than to have different souls <\s>
<s> your father will never forgive you and i've practically nothing <\s>

<s> how are you going to stand it with a woman who <\s>
<s> it's the little things <\s>
<s> i know all that thanks <\s>
<s> nobody does till they've been through it <\s>
<s> marriage is hard enough when people are of the same class <\s>
<s> with a sudden movement towards him oh <\s>
<s> my dear before it's too late <\s>
<s> after a struggle it's no good <\s>
<s> it's not fair to her <\s>
<s> it can only end in her misery <\s>
<s> leave that to me please <\s>

<s> bill on your word of honour are you acting of your own free will <\s>
<s> breaking away from her i can't stand any more <\s>
<s> he goes out into the workroom lady cheshire <\s>
<s> what in god's name shall i do <\s>
<s> in her distress she walks up and doom the room then goes to the workroom door and opens it <\s>
<s> come in here please freda <\s>
<s> after a seconds pause freda white and trembling appears in the doorway followed by bill <\s>
<s> i want to speak to her alone <\s>
<s> bill does not move <\s>
<s> icily i must ask you to leave us <\s>
<s> bill hesitates then shrugging his shoulders he touches freda's arms and goes back into the workroom closing the door <\s>
<s> how did it come about <\s>
<s> i don't know my lady <\s>
<s> for heaven's sake child don't call me that again whatever happens <\s>
<s> she walks to the window and speaks from there i know well enough how love comes <\s>

<s> freda shakes her head there's nothing more dreadful than for a woman to hang like a stone round a man's neck <\s>
<s> how far has it gone <\s>
<s> won't give him away <\s>
<s> both of you the same <\s>
<s> what's the use of that with me <\s>
<s> wasn't he with you when you went for your holiday this summer <\s>
<s> like a man you mean <\s>
<s> it hasn't been his fault <\s>
<s> i love him so <\s>
<s> lady cheshire turns abruptly and begins to walk up and down the room <\s>
<s> then stopping she looks intently at freda <\s>
<s> i don't know what to say to you <\s>
<s> it can't and shan't go on <\s>
<s> sullenly i know i'm not his equal but i am somebody <\s>
<s> answering this first assertion of rights with a sudden steeliness does he love you now <\s>
<s> that's not fair it's not fair <\s>
<s> if men are like gunpowder freda women are not <\s>
<s> if you've lost him it's been your own fault <\s>

<s> it's only four months <\s>
<s> looking down and speaking rapidly listen to me <\s>
<s> i love my son but i know him i know all his kind of man <\s>
<s> i've lived with one for thirty years <\s>
<s> i know the way their senses work <\s>
<s> when they want a thing they must have it and then they're sorry <\s>
<s> sullenly he's not sorry <\s>
<s> is his love big enough to carry you both over everything .... <\s>
<s> you know it isn't <\s>
<s> if i were a lady you wouldn't talk like that <\s>
<s> if you were a lady there'd be no trouble before either of you <\s>
<s> you'll make him hate you <\s>
<s> i won't believe it <\s>
<s> i could make him happy out there <\s>
<s> i don't want to be so odious as to say all the things you must know <\s>
<s> i only ask you to try and put yourself in our position <\s>
<s> you ought to know me better than to think i'm purely selfish <\s>
<s> would you like to put yourself in my position <\s>
<s> in a low horror stricken voice oh <\s>
<s> there is a dead silence then going swiftly up to her she looks straight into freda's eyes <\s>
<s> meeting her gaze oh <\s>
<s> then to bill who has come in from the workroom she gasps out i never meant to tell <\s>
<s> well are you satisfied <\s>
<s> below her breath this is terrible <\s>

<s> after a look at his mother bill turns abruptly and goes back into the workroom <\s>
<s> lady cheshire moves towards the window <\s>
<s> following her sisters the car's round <\s>
<s> sir william's voice is heard from the corridor calling dorothy <\s>
<s> as lady cheshire passing her handkerchief over her face turns round he enters <\s>
<s> he is in full hunting dress well weathered pink buckskins and mahogany tops <\s>
<s> just off my dear <\s>
<s> to his daughters genially rehearsin <\s>
<s> he goes up to freda holding out his gloved right hand button that for me freda would you <\s>

<s> balmy as may scent ought to be first rate <\s>
<s> to lady cheshire good bye my dear <\s>
<s> sampson's gorse best day of the whole year <\s>
<s> he pats joan on the shoulder wish you were cumin out joan <\s>
<s> he goes out leaving the door open and as his footsteps and the chink of his spurs die away freda turns and rushes into the workroom <\s>
<s> but lady cheshire waves the question aside passes her daughter and goes out into the corridor <\s>
<s> the sound of a motor car is heard <\s>
<s> running to the window they've started <\s>
<s> go away you're not fit for this <\s>
<s> aghast i am fit <\s>
<s> in a hard voice mother ought to have told us <\s>
<s> it can't be very awful <\s>

<s> it's horrible not knowing anything <\s>
<s> i wish runny hadn't gone <\s>

<s> it's always like this women kept in blinkers <\s>
<s> that awful old man <\s>
<s> don't talk of father like that <\s>

<s> heaven help freda whatever she's done <\s>
<s> i'd sooner be a private in a german regiment than a woman <\s>
<s> don't talk that nonsense about women <\s>
<s> you're married and out of it and ronny's not one of these terrific john bulls <\s>
<s> to joan who has opened the door looking for john <\s>
<s> no good my dear lath and plaster <\s>
<s> from the door in a frightened whisper here's mabel <\s>
<s> heavens and the waters under the earth <\s>
<s> if we only knew <\s>
<s> mabel comes in the three girls are silent with their eyes fixed on their books <\s>
<s> looking straight at her we're chucking it for to day <\s>
<s> hesitating is it bad enough for me to go <\s>
<s> sardonically i should think very likely <\s>
<s> while she is looking from face to face bill comes in from the workroom <\s>
<s> he starts to walk across the room but stops and looks stolidly at the four girls <\s>
<s> fact of the matter is miss lanfarne i'm engaged to my mother's maid <\s>
<s> no one moves or speaks <\s>
<s> suddenly mabel lanfarne goes towards him holding out her hand <\s>
<s> bill does not take her hand but bows <\s>
<s> then after a swift glance at the girls faces mabel goes out into the corridor and the three girls are left staring at their brother <\s>
<s> coolly thought you might like to know <\s>
<s> he too goes out into the corridor christine <\s>
<s> i never thought of anything as bad as that <\s>
<s> something must be done <\s>
<s> suddenly to herself ha <\s>
<s> when father went up to have his glove buttoned <\s>
<s> there is a sound jackson has came in from the corridor <\s>
<s> to dot if you please miss studdenham's brought up the other two pups <\s>
<s> will you kindly take a look at them he says <\s>
<s> not just now jackson <\s>
<s> is studdenham and the pups to wait mm <\s>
<s> dot shakes her head violently <\s>
<s> but studdenham is seen already standing in the doorway with a spaniel puppy in either side pocket <\s>
<s> he comes in and jackson stands waiting behind him <\s>
<s> this fellow's the best miss dot <\s>
<s> he protrudes the right hand pocket i was keeping him for my girl a proper greedy one takes after his father <\s>
<s> the girls stare at him in silence <\s>
<s> hastily thanks studdenham i see <\s>
<s> i won't take em out in here <\s>
<s> they're rather bold yet <\s>
<s> desperately no no of course <\s>
<s> then you think you'd like him miss dot <\s>
<s> the other's got a white chest she's a lady <\s>
<s> he protrudes the left hand pocket dot <\s>
<s> studdenham thanks thanks awfully <\s>
<s> wonderful faithful creatures follow you like a woman <\s>
<s> you can't shake em off anyhow <\s>
<s> he protrudes the right hand pocket my girl she'd set her heart on him but she'll just have to do without <\s>
<s> as though galvanised oh <\s>
<s> no i can't take it away from her <\s>
<s> bless you she won't mind <\s>
<s> he turns to the door <\s>
<s> to the puppy ah <\s>
<s> tryin to wriggle out of it <\s>
<s> he goes out followed by jackson christine <\s>
<s> suddenly catching sight of the book in her hand caste <\s>
<s> she gives vent to a short sharp laugh the curtain falls <\s>
<s> act iii it is five o'clock of the same day <\s>
<s> the scene is the smoking room with walls of leander red covered by old steeplechase and hunting prints <\s>
<s> armchairs encircle a high ferulered hearth in which a fire is burning <\s>
<s> the curtains are not yet drawn across mullioned windows but electric light is burning <\s>
<s> there are two doors leading the one to the billiard room the other to a corridor <\s>
<s> bill is pacing up and doom harold at the fireplace stands looking at him with commiseration <\s>
<s> they won't be in yet if that's any consolation <\s>
<s> always a tough meet softly as the tiger said when he ate the man <\s>
<s> you're the only person i can stand within a mile of me harold <\s>
<s> do you seriously think you're going to make it any better by marrying her <\s>
<s> bill shrugs his shoulders still pacing the room bill <\s>
<s> i'm not the sort that finds it easy to say things <\s>
<s> but i've got a kind of self respect though you wouldn't think it <\s>
<s> my dear old chap <\s>
<s> this is about as low down a thing as one could have done i suppose one's own mother's maid we've known her since she was so high <\s>
<s> i see it now that i've got over the attack <\s>
<s> if you're no longer keen on her bill <\s>
<s> do apply your reason old boy <\s>
<s> there is silence while bill again paces up and dozen <\s>
<s> if you think i care two straws about the morality of the thing <\s>
<s> my dear old man <\s>
<s> it's simply that i shall feel such a d  d skunk if i leave her in the lurch with everybody knowing <\s>
<s> try it yourself you'd soon see <\s>
<s> it's not as if she'd tried to force me into it <\s>
<s> and she's a soft little thing <\s>
<s> why i ever made such a sickening ass of myself i can't think <\s>
<s> i never meant harold <\s>
<s> but don't do anything rash bill keep your head old man <\s>
<s> i don't see what loss i should be if i did clear out of the country <\s>
<s> the sound of cannoning billiard balls is heard who's that knocking the balls about <\s>
<s> the sound ceases bill <\s>
<s> he's coming in here <\s>
<s> as latter appears from the billiard room he goes hurriedly out <\s>
<s> pacing up and down in his turn rat in a cage is a fool to him <\s>
<s> this is the sort of thing you read of in books john <\s>
<s> what price your argument with runny now <\s>
<s> well it's not too late for you luckily <\s>
<s> what do you mean <\s>
<s> you needn't connect yourself with this eccentric family <\s>
<s> i'm not a bounder harold <\s>
<s> it's terrible for your sisters <\s>
<s> deuced lucky we haven't a lot of people staying here <\s>
<s> john i feel awfully bad about this <\s>
<s> if something isn't done pretty mess i shall be in <\s>
<s> if the governor cuts bill off it'll all come to me <\s>
<s> i say the play <\s>
<s> got us fairly on the hop <\s>
<s> it's too bad of bill <\s>
<s> there are thousands of fellows who'd never dream of sticking to the girl considering what it means <\s>
<s> haven't you any human sympathy <\s>
<s> don't you know how these things come about <\s>
<s> it's like a spark in a straw yard <\s>
<s> one doesn't take lighted pipes into strawyards unless one's an idiot or worse <\s>
<s> with a grin you're not allowed tobacco <\s>
<s> in the good old days no one would hive thought anything of this <\s>
<s> spare me your great grandfather <\s>
<s> i could tell you of at least a dozen men i know who've been through this same business and got off scot free and now because bill's going to play the game it'll smash him up <\s>
<s> why didn't he play the game at the beginning <\s>
<s> i can't stand your sort john <\s>
<s> when a thing like this happens all you can do is to cry out why didn't he <\s>
<s> what's to be done that's the point <\s>
<s> of course he'll have to <\s>
<s> what do you mean by that <\s>
<s> you feel in your bones that a marriage'll be hopeless just as i do knowing bill and the girl and everything <\s>
<s> the whole thing is is most unfortunate <\s>
<s> i should think it was <\s>
<s> as he speaks christine and keith come in from the billiard room <\s>
<s> he is still in splashed hunting clothes and looks exceptionally weathered thin lipped reticent <\s>
<s> he lights a cigarette and sinks into an armchair <\s>
<s> behind them dot and joan have come stealing in <\s>
<s> this waiting for father to be told is awful <\s>
<s> to keith where did you leave the old man <\s>
<s> he'll be home in ten minutes <\s>
<s> they all stir as if at fresh consciousness of discomfiture <\s>
<s> she walked into gracely and sent herself a telegram <\s>
<s> and we shall say good bye as if nothing had happened <\s>
<s> it's up to you ronny <\s>
<s> keith looking at joan slowly emits smoke and latter passing his arm through joan's draws her away with him into the billiard room <\s>
<s> i'm not a squeamy squirrel <\s>
<s> anybody seen the girl since <\s>
<s> she's just sitting there <\s>
<s> in a hard voice as we're all doing <\s>
<s> she's so soft that's what's so horrible <\s>
<s> if one could only feel <\s>
<s> she's got to face the music like the rest of us <\s>
<s> the whole thing's like a concertina and some one jigging it <\s>
<s> they all turn as the door opens and a footman enters with a tray of whiskey gin lemons and soda water <\s>
<s> in dead silence the footman puts the tray down <\s>
<s> forcing his voice did you get a run ronny <\s>
<s> as keith nods what point <\s>
<s> will you take tea sir <\s>
<s> in dead silence again the footman goes out and they all look after him <\s>
<s> below his breath good gad <\s>
<s> that's a squeeze of it <\s>
<s> what's our line of country to be <\s>
<s> all depends on father <\s>
<s> sir william's between the devil and the deep sea as it strikes me <\s>
<s> he'll simply forbid it utterly of course <\s>
<s> man who reads family prayers and lessons on sunday forbids son to christine ronny <\s>
<s> i'm not saying bill ought to marry her <\s>
<s> she's got to stand the racket <\s>
<s> but your dad will have a tough job to take up that position <\s>
<s> what on earth d'you mean dot <\s>
<s> morality in one eye and your title in the other <\s>
<s> you're all reckoning without your bill <\s>
<s> sir william can cut him off no mortal power can help the title going down if bill chooses to be such a he draws in his breath with a sharp hiss harold <\s>
<s> i won't take what bill ought to have nor would any of you girls i should think <\s>
<s> patting his wife's arm hardly the point is it <\s>
<s> if it wasn't for mother <\s>
<s> freda's just as much of a lady as most girls <\s>
<s> why shouldn't he marry her and go to canada <\s>
<s> it's what he's really fit for <\s>
<s> well imagine him in parliament <\s>
<s> that's what he'll come to if he stays here jolly for the country <\s>
<s> we must find a way of stopping bill <\s>
<s> let's go and beg him ronny <\s>
<s> the only hope is in the girl <\s>
<s> she hasn't the stuff in her <\s>
<s> what price young dunning <\s>
<s> it's past joking harold <\s>
<s> gloomily old studdenham's better than most relations by marriage <\s>
<s> holding up his hand there's his horse going round <\s>
<s> they turn from listening to the sound to see lady cheshire coming from the billiard room <\s>
<s> she is very pale <\s>
<s> they all rise and dot puts an arm round her while keith pushes forward his chair <\s>
<s> joan and latter too have come stealing back <\s>
<s> she sits down dot <\s>
<s> shall i get you a fur <\s>
<s> in a low voice play up mother darling <\s>
<s> straightening herself what sort of a run ronny <\s>
<s> brazier's to caffyn's dyke good straight line <\s>
<s> and the young horse <\s>
<s> carries his ears in your mouth a bit that's all <\s>
<s> putting his hand on her shoulder cheer up mem sahib <\s>
<s> mother must anything be said to father <\s>
<s> ronny thinks it all depends on her <\s>
<s> can't you use your influence <\s>
<s> lady cheshire shakes her head christine <\s>
<s> but mother it's desperate <\s>
<s> of course mother can't <\s>
<s> we simply couldn't beg her to let us off <\s>
<s> there must be some way <\s>
<s> what do you think in your heart mother <\s>
<s> it must be faced now or never <\s>
<s> in a low voice haven't you any self respect <\s>
<s> we shall be the laughing stock of the whole county <\s>
<s> mother do speak to her <\s>
<s> you know it'll be misery for both of them <\s>
<s> lady cheshire bows her head well then <\s>
<s> lady cheshire shakes her head christine <\s>
<s> not even for bill's sake <\s>
<s> well for heaven's sake speak to bill again mother <\s>
<s> we ought all to go on our knees to him <\s>
<s> he's with your father now <\s>
<s> passionately he didn't think of us <\s>
<s> i can't i never shall something must be done <\s>
<s> you know what bill is <\s>
<s> he rushes at things so when he gets his head down <\s>
<s> it's only fair to her and all of us <\s>
<s> painfully there are things one can't do <\s>
<s> i know you can make her give him up if you'll only say all you can <\s>
<s> and after all what's coming won't affect her as if she'd been a lady <\s>
<s> only you can do it mother do back me up all of you <\s>
<s> it's the only way <\s>
<s> hypnotised by their private longing for what christine has been urging they have all fixed their eyes on lady cheshire who looks from face to face and moves her hands as if in physical pain <\s>
<s> lady cheshire suddenly rises looking towards the billiard room door listening <\s>
<s> they all follow her eyes <\s>
<s> she sits down again passing her hand over her lips as sir william enters <\s>
<s> his hunting clothes are splashed his face very grim and set <\s>
<s> he walks to the fore without a glance at any one and stands looking down into it <\s>
<s> very quietly every one but lady cheshire steals away <\s>
<s> what have you done <\s>
<s> don't keep me in suspense <\s>
<s> i didn't think i had a blackguard for a son who was a fool into the bargain <\s>
<s> rising if he were a blackguard he would not be what you call a fool <\s>
<s> after staring angrily makes her a slight bow very well <\s>
<s> in a low voice bill don't be harsh <\s>
<s> it's all too terrible <\s>
<s> sit down my dear <\s>
<s> she resumes her seat and he turns back to the fire sir william <\s>
<s> in all my life i've never been face to face with a thing like this <\s>
<s> gripping the mantelpiece so hard that his hands and arms are seen shaking you ask me to be calm <\s>
<s> i am trying to be <\s>

<s> i am trying to think <\s>
<s> i understand that you've known this piece of news since this morning <\s>
<s> i've known it ten minutes <\s>
<s> give me a little time please <\s>
<s> then after a silence where's the girl <\s>
<s> raising his clenched fist what in god's name is he about <\s>
<s> what have you said to him <\s>
<s> he breaks away from the fire and walks up and down my family goes back to the thirteenth century <\s>
<s> nowadays they laugh at that <\s>
<s> nowadays they laugh at everything they even laugh at the word lady <\s>
<s> i married you and i don't .... <\s>
<s> married his mother's maid <\s>
<s> i don't know what we've done to deserve this it's a death blow <\s>
<s> i'm not prepared to sit down and wait for it <\s>
<s> with sudden fierceness there are plenty in these days who'll be glad enough for this to happen plenty of these d  d socialists and radicals who'll laugh their souls out over what they haven't the bowels to sees a tragedy <\s>
<s> i say it would be a tragedy for you and me and all of us <\s>
<s> you and i were brought up and we've brought the children up with certain beliefs and wants and habits <\s>
<s> a man's past his traditions he can't get rid of them <\s>
<s> suddenly it shan't go on <\s>
<s> what's to prevent it <\s>
<s> i utterly forbid this piece of madness <\s>
<s> but the thing we can't stop <\s>
<s> provision must be made <\s>
<s> suddenly perceiving what she is alluding to you're thinking of young young shortly i don't see the connection <\s>
<s> what's so awful is that the boy's trying to do what's loyal and we his father and mother <\s>
<s> i'm not going to see my eldest son ruin his life <\s>
<s> i must think this out <\s>
<s> beneath her breath i've tried that it doesn't help <\s>
<s> this girl who was born on the estate had the run of the house brought up with money earned from me nothing but kindness from all of us she's broken the common rules of gratitude and decency she lured him on i haven't a doubt <\s>
<s> to herself in a way i suppose <\s>

<s> i've seen it before <\s>
<s> as to that other matter it's soon forgotten constantly happening why my own grandfather <\s>
<s> stares before him in silence suddenly you must go to the girl <\s>
<s> she'll never hold out against you <\s>
<s> i did before i knew what was in front of her i said all i could <\s>
<s> i can't go again now <\s>
<s> i can't do it bill <\s>

<s> then as lady cheshire makes a move of distress if he marries her i've done with him <\s>
<s> as far as i'm concerned he'll cease to exist <\s>
<s> the title i can't help <\s>
<s> does that meet your wishes <\s>
<s> with sudden fire you've no right to put such an alternative to me <\s>
<s> i'd give ten years of my life to prevent this marriage <\s>
<s> i'll go to bill <\s>
<s> i'll beg him on my knees <\s>
<s> then why can't you go to the girl <\s>
<s> she deserves no consideration <\s>
<s> it's not a question of morality morality be d  d <\s>

<s> i've tried i putting her hand to her throat can't get it out <\s>
<s> staring at her you won't go to her <\s>

<s> i'll do it myself <\s>
<s> with a look back at him lady cheshire goes out into the corridor <\s>
<s> this is a nice end to my day <\s>
<s> he takes a small china cup from of the mantel piece it breaks with the pressure of his hand and falls into the fireplace <\s>
<s> while he stands looking at it blankly there is a knock <\s>
<s> freda enters from the corridor <\s>
<s> i've asked you to be good enough to come in order that pointing to chair you may sit down <\s>
<s> but though she advances two or three steps she does not sit down <\s>
<s> this is a sad business <\s>
<s> below her breath yes sir william <\s>
<s> becoming conscious of the depths of feeling before him i er are you attached to my son <\s>
<s> in a whisper yes <\s>
<s> it's very painful to me to have to do this <\s>
<s> he turns away from her and speaks to the fire i sent for you to ask quickly how old are you <\s>
<s> more resolutely do you expect me to sanction such a mad idea as a marriage <\s>
<s> i don't expect anything <\s>
<s> you know you haven't earned the right to be considered <\s>
<s> that oughtn't to help you <\s>
<s> now brace yourself up and listen to me <\s>
<s> she stands waiting to hear her sentence <\s>
<s> sir william looks at her and his glance gradually wavers <\s>
<s> i've not a word to say for my son <\s>
<s> he's behaved like a scamp <\s>
<s> with a silencing gesture at the same time what made you forget yourself <\s>
<s> you've no excuse you know <\s>
<s> you'll deserve all you'll get <\s>
<s> to expect me to it's intolerable <\s>
<s> do you know where my son is <\s>
<s> faintly i think he's in the billiard room with my lady <\s>
<s> with renewed resolution i wanted to to put it to you as a as a what <\s>
<s> seeing her stand so absolutely motionless looking at him he turns abruptly and opens the billiard room door i'll speak to him first <\s>
<s> come in here please <\s>
<s> to freda go in and wait <\s>
<s> lady cheshire and bill come in and freda passing them goes into the billiard room to wait <\s>
<s> speaking with a pause between each sentence your mother and i have spoken of this calamity <\s>
<s> i imagine that even you have some dim perception of the monstrous nature of it <\s>
<s> i must tell you this if you do this mad thing you fend for yourself <\s>
<s> you'll receive nothing from me now or hereafter <\s>
<s> i consider that only due to the position our family has always held here <\s>
<s> your brother will take your place <\s>
<s> we shall get on as best we can without you <\s>
<s> there is a dead silence till he adds sharply well <\s>
<s> i shall marry her <\s>
<s> to sir william you've mistaken your man sir <\s>
<s> because i'm a rotter in one way i'm not necessarily a rotter in all <\s>
<s> you put the butt end of the pistol to dunning's head yesterday you put the other end to mine to day <\s>
<s> he turns round to go out let the d  d thing off <\s>
<s> turning to her i'm not going to leave her in the lurch <\s>
<s> do me the justice to admit that i have not attempted to persuade you to <\s>
<s> you've chucked me out <\s>
<s> i don't see what else you could have done under the circumstances <\s>
<s> it's quite all right <\s>
<s> but if you wanted me to throw her over father you went the wrong way to work that's all neither you nor i are very good at seeing consequences <\s>
<s> do you realise your position <\s>
<s> grimly i've a fair notion of it <\s>
<s> with a sudden outburst you have none not the faintest brought up as you've been <\s>
<s> i didn't bring myself up <\s>
<s> with a movement of uncontrolled anger to which his son responds you ungrateful young dog <\s>
<s> they drop their eyes and stand silent sir william <\s>
<s> with grimly suppressed emotion i am speaking under the stress of very great pain some consideration is due to me <\s>
<s> this is a disaster which i never expected to have to face <\s>
<s> it is a matter which i naturally can never hope to forget <\s>
<s> i shall carry this down to my death <\s>
<s> we shall all of us do that <\s>
<s> i have had the misfortune all my life to believe in our position here to believe that we counted for something that the country wanted us <\s>
<s> i have tried to do my duty by that position <\s>
<s> i find in one moment that it is gone smoke gone <\s>

<s> it's a bad business for me father as well as for you he stops seeing that jackson has route in and is standing there waiting <\s>
<s> will you speak to studdenham sir william <\s>

<s> men ha been shot for less <\s>
<s> if you like to have a pot at me studdenham you're welcome <\s>
<s> averting his eyes from bill at the sheer idiocy of this sequel to his words i've been in your service five and twenty years sir william but this is man to man this is <\s>
<s> i don't deny that studdenham <\s>
<s> with eyes shifting in sheer anger no 'twouldn't be very easy <\s>
<s> did i understand him to say that he offers her marriage <\s>
<s> into his beard well that's something <\s>
<s> moving his hands as if wringing the neck of a bird i'm tryin to see the rights o this <\s>
<s> bitterly you've all your work cut out for you studdenham <\s>
<s> again studdenham makes the unconscious wringing movement with his hands <\s>
<s> turning from it with a sort of horror don't studdenham <\s>
<s> under her breath your your hands <\s>
<s> while studdenham is still staring at her freda is seen standing in the doorway like a black ghost <\s>
<s> freda moves a few steps towards her father when did you start this <\s>
<s> almost inaudibly in the summer father <\s>
<s> don't be harsh to her <\s>
<s> his eyes again move from side to side as if pain and anger had bewildered them <\s>
<s> then looking sideways at freda but in a gentler voice and when did you tell him about what's come to you <\s>
<s> with sudden menace you young <\s>
<s> he makes a convulsive movement of one hand then in the silence seems to lose grip of his thoughts and pits his hand up to his head i want to clear me mind a bit i don't see it plain at all <\s>
<s> without looking at bill tis said there's been an offer of marriage <\s>
<s> i've made it i stick to it <\s>
<s> with slow puzzled anger i want time to get the pith o this <\s>
<s> you don't say anything sir william <\s>
<s> the facts are all before you <\s>
<s> scarcely moving his lips m'lady <\s>
<s> lady cheshire is silent <\s>

<s> to freda you hear the handsome offer that's been made you <\s>
<s> freda moistens her lips and tries to speak but cannot if nobody's to speak a word we won't get much forrarder <\s>
<s> i'd like for you to say what's in your mind sir william <\s>
<s> i if my son marries her he'll have to make his own way <\s>
<s> savagely i'm not puttin thought to that <\s>
<s> i didn't suppose you were studdenham <\s>
<s> it appears to rest with your daughter <\s>
<s> he suddenly takes out his handkerchief and puts it to his forehead infernal fires they make up here <\s>
<s> lady cheshire who is again shivering desperately as if with intense cold makes a violent attempt to control her shuddering <\s>
<s> suddenly there's luxuries that's got to be paid for <\s>
<s> to freda speak up now <\s>
<s> freda turns slowly and looks up at sir william he involuntarily raises his hand to his mouth <\s>
<s> her eyes travel on to lady cheshire who faces her but so deadly pale that she looks as if she were going to faint <\s>
<s> the girl's gaze passes on to bill standing rigid with his jaw set <\s>
<s> i want then flinging her arm up over her eyes she turns from him no <\s>
<s> at that sound of profound relief studdenham whose eyes have been following his daughter's moves towards sir william all his emotion turned into sheer angry pride <\s>
<s> don't be afraid sir william <\s>
<s> we want none of you <\s>
<s> she'll not force herself where she's not welcome <\s>
<s> she may ha slipped her good name but she'll keep her proper pride <\s>
<s> i'll have no charity marriage in my family <\s>
<s> if the young gentleman has tired of her in three months as a blind man can see by the looks of him she's not for him <\s>
<s> stepping forward i'm ready to make it up to her <\s>
<s> he takes hold of freda and looks around him well <\s>
<s> she's not the first this has happened to since the world began an she won't be the last <\s>

<s> turning his face and eyes lighted up by a sort of smiling snarl ah <\s>

<s> but there's things that can't be undone <\s>
<s> he follows freda out <\s>
<s> as the door closes sir william's calm gives way <\s>

<s> bill following freda and studdenham has stopped at the shut door <\s>
<s> lady cheshire moves swiftly close to him <\s>
<s> the door of the billiard room is opened and dot appears <\s>

<s> slowly shaking her head see <\s>

<s> awed the great horn for to morrow <\s>

<s> the great horn is not possible <\s>
<s> and you're the famous felsman <\s>

<s> to please you i would sleep with seven german gentlemen <\s>
<s> no it is not necessary <\s>

<s> clasping her hands that is like me but i am always here <\s>
<s> yes there is no one like you in towns <\s>

<s> suddenly in the towns there are theatres and there is beautiful fine work and dancing and churches and trains and all the things in books and lamond <\s>

<s> from the window seat it was hard for him here <\s>
<s> he goes up to her stays a moment looking down then bends and kisses her hungrily <\s>
<s> he does not answer but turning out the lamp goes into an inner room <\s>
<s> seelchen sits gazing through the window at the peaks bathed in full moonlight <\s>
<s> then drawing the blankets about her she snuggles doom on the window seat <\s>
<s> in a sleepy voice they kissed me both <\s>
<s> she sleeps the scene falls quite dark scene ii the scene is slowly illumined as by dawn <\s>
<s> seelchen is still lying on the window seat <\s>
<s> she sits up freeing her face and hands from the blankets changing the swathings of deep sleep for the filmy coverings of a dream <\s>
<s> the wall of the hut has vanished there is nothing between her and the three mountains veiled in mist save a through of darkness <\s>
<s> there as the peaks of the mountains brighten they are seen to have great faces <\s>
<s> the face of the wine horn is the profile of a beardless youth <\s>
<s> the face of the cow horn is that of a mountain shepherd <\s>
<s> solemn and broom with fierce black eyes and a black beard <\s>
<s> between them the great horn whose hair is of snow has a high <\s>
<s> beardless visage as of carved bronze like a male sphinx serene without cruelty <\s>
<s> far down below the faces of the peaks <\s>
<s> above the trough of darkness are peeping out the four little heads of the flowers of edelweiss and gentian mountain dandelion and alpenrose on their heads are crowns made of their several flowers all powdered with dewdrops and when the flowers lift their child faces little tinkling bells ring <\s>
<s> all around the peaks there is nothing but blue sky <\s>
<s> in a tiny voice would you <\s>
<s> dandelion alpenrose with their bells ranging enviously oo oo oo <\s>
<s> from behind the cow horn are heard the voices of cowbells and mountain air clinkel clink <\s>
<s> from behind the wine horn rise the rival voices of view of italy flume of steam and things in books i am italy <\s>
<s> see me steam in the distance <\s>
<s> o remember the things in books <\s>
<s> and all call out together very softly with the flowers ringing their bells <\s>
<s> then far away like an echo comes a sighing mountain air <\s>
<s> and suddenly the peak of the cow horn speaks in a voice as of one unaccustomed <\s>
<s> amongst kine and my black brown sheep i live i am silence and monotony i am the solemn hills <\s>
<s> i am fierceness and the mountain wind clean pasture and wild rest <\s>
<s> look in my eyes <\s>

<s> i am the will o the wisp that dances thro the streets i am the cooing dove of towns from the plane trees and the chestnuts shade <\s>

<s> he has all things <\s>
<s> mine are the clouds with the dark silvered wings mine are the rocks on fire with the sun and the dewdrops cooler than pearls <\s>
<s> away from my breath of snow and sweet grass thou wilt droop little soul <\s>
<s> the dark clove is my fragrance <\s>

<s> i will never desert thee <\s>
<s> a hundred times i will desert you a hundred times come back and kiss you <\s>

<s> from far away comes the sound as of mandolins <\s>

<s> and both thou shalt love little soul <\s>
<s> thou shalt lie on the hills with silence and dance in the cities with knowledge <\s>
<s> both shall possess thee <\s>
<s> the sun and the moon on the mountains shall burn thee the lamps of the town singe thy wings <\s>

<s> burn on thou pretty flame trying to eat the world <\s>
<s> thou shaft come to me at last my little soul <\s>
<s> the voices and the flower bells peal out <\s>
<s> seelchen enraptured stretches her arms to embrace the sight and sound but all fades slowly into dark sleep <\s>
<s> scene iii the dark scene again becomes glamorous <\s>
<s> seelchen is seen with her hand stretched out towards the piazza of a little town with a plane tree on one side a wall on the other and from the open doorway of an inn a pale path of light <\s>
<s> over the inn hangs a full golden moon <\s>
<s> against the wall under the glimmer of a lamp leans a youth with the face of the wine horn in a crimson dock thrumming a mandolin and singing little star soul through the frost fields of night roaming alone disconsolate from out the cold i call thee in striking my dark mandolin beneath this moon of gold <\s>
<s> from the inn comes a burst of laughter and the sound of dancing <\s>
<s> seelchen whispering it is the big world <\s>
<s> the youth of the wine horn sings on pretty grey moth where the strange candles shine seeking for warmth so desperate ah <\s>
<s> fluttering dove i bid thee win striking my dark mandolin the crimson flame of love <\s>
<s> gazing enraptured at the inn they are dancing <\s>
<s> as she speaks from either side come moth children meeting and fluttering up the path of light to the inn doorway then wheeling aside they form again and again flutter forward <\s>
<s> holding out her hands they are real <\s>
<s> their wings are windy <\s>
<s> the youth of the wine horn sings on lips of my song to the white maiden's heart go ye and whisper passionate <\s>
<s> these words that burn o listening one <\s>
<s> love that flieth past is gone nor ever may return seelchen runs towards him but the light above him fades he has become shadow <\s>
<s> she turns bewildered to the dancing moth children but they vanish before her <\s>
<s> at the door of the inn stands lamond in a dark cloak <\s>
<s> without my little soul i am cold <\s>
<s> he holds out his arms to her seelchen <\s>
<s> shall i be safe <\s>
<s> are you safe in your mountains <\s>
<s> where am i here <\s>
<s> smiling he points to the doorway <\s>
<s> and silent as shadows there come dancing out two by two two girls and two youths <\s>
<s> the first girl is dressed in white satin and jewels and the first youth in black velvet <\s>
<s> the second girl is in rags and a shawl and the second youth in shirt and corduroys <\s>
<s> they dance gravely each couple as if in a world apart <\s>
<s> whispering in the mountains all dance together <\s>
<s> do they never change partners <\s>
<s> how could they little one <\s>
<s> those are rich these poor <\s>
<s> a corybantic couple come dancing forth <\s>
<s> the girl has bare limbs <\s>
<s> a flame coloured shift and hair bound with red flowers the youth wears a panther skin <\s>
<s> they pursue not only each other <\s>
<s> but the other girls and youths <\s>
<s> for a moment all is a furious medley <\s>
<s> then the corybantic couple vanish into the inn and the first two couples are left slowly solemnly dancing apart from each other as before <\s>
<s> shuddering shall i one day dance like that <\s>
<s> the youth of the wine horn appears again beneath the lamp <\s>
<s> he strikes a loud chord then as seelchen moves towards that sound the lamp goes out there is again only blue shadow but the couples have disappeared into the inn and the doorway has grown dark <\s>
<s> what i do not like he will not let me see <\s>
<s> will you not come then little soul <\s>
<s> the shutters of the houses are suddenly thrown wide <\s>
<s> in a lighted room on one aide of the inn are seen two pale men and a woman amongst many clicking machines <\s>
<s> on the other side of the inn in a forge are visible two women and a man but half clothed making chains <\s>
<s> recoiling from both sights in turn how sad they look all <\s>
<s> what are they making <\s>
<s> in the dark doorway of the inn a light shines out and in it is seen a figure visible only from the waist up clad in gold cloth studded with jewels with a flushed complacent face holding in one hand a glass of golden wine <\s>
<s> what is it standing on <\s>
<s> unseen the wine horn's mandolin twangs out <\s>
<s> for that do not look little soul <\s>
<s> can it not walk <\s>
<s> he shakes his head is that all they make here with their sadness <\s>
<s> but again the mandolin twangs out the shutters fall over the houses the door of the inn grows dark <\s>
<s> what is it then you would have <\s>
<s> there are books here that piled on each other would reach to the stars <\s>
<s> but seelchen shakes her head there is religion so deep that no man knows what it means <\s>
<s> but seelchen shakes her head there is religion so shallow you may have it by turning a handle <\s>
<s> is god with your goats <\s>
<s> but seelchen shakes her head what then do you want <\s>
<s> the mandolin twangs out <\s>
<s> pointing to his breast there is but one road to life <\s>
<s> but i do not love <\s>
<s> when a feather dies is it not loving the wind the unknown <\s>
<s> when the day brings not new things we are children of sorrow <\s>
<s> if darkness and light did not change could we breathe <\s>
<s> to live is to love to love is to live seeking for wonder <\s>
<s> and as she draws nearer see <\s>
<s> to love is to peer over the edge and spying the little grey flower to climb down <\s>
<s> it has wings it has flown again you must climb it shivers tis but air in your hand you must crawl you must cling you must leap and still it is there and not there for the grey flower flits like a moth and the wind of its wings is all you shall catch <\s>
<s> but your eyes shall be shining your cheeks shall be burning your breast shall be panting ah <\s>
<s> the scene falls darker and when the night comes there it is still thistledown blown on the dark and your white hands will reach for it and your honey breath waft it and never never shall you grasp that wanton thing but life shall be lovely <\s>
<s> his voice dies to a whisper <\s>
<s> he stretches out his arms seelchen <\s>
<s> touching his breast i will come <\s>
<s> drawing her to the dark doorway love me <\s>
<s> the mandolin twangs out the doorway for a moment is all glamorous and they pass through <\s>
<s> illumined by the glimmer of the lamp the youth of the wine hour is seen again <\s>
<s> and slowly to the chords of his mandolin he begins to sing the windy hours through darkness fly canst hear them little heart <\s>
<s> new loves are born and old loves die and kissing lips must part <\s>
<s> the dusky bees of passing years canst see them soul of mine from flower and flower supping tears and pale sweet honey wine <\s>
<s> his voice grown strange and passionate o flame that treads the marsh of time <\s>
<s> flitting for ever low <\s>
<s> where through the black enchanted slime <\s>
<s> we desperate following go untimely fire we bid thee stay <\s>
<s> into dark air above <\s>
<s> the golden gipsy thins away so has it been with love <\s>
<s> while he is singing the moon grows pale and dies <\s>
<s> it falls dark save for the glimmer of the lamp beneath which he stands <\s>
<s> but as his song ends the dawn breaks over the houses the lamp goes out the wine horn becomes shadow <\s>
<s> then from the doorway of the inn in the shrill grey light seelchen comes forth <\s>
<s> she is pale as if wan with living her eyes like pitch against the powdery whiteness of her face <\s>
<s> my heart is old <\s>
<s> but as she speaks from far away is heard a faint chiming of cowbells and while she stands listening lamond appears in the doorway of the inn <\s>
<s> i have new wonders <\s>
<s> you have not tired of me that am never the same <\s>
<s> the chime of the cowbells is heard again <\s>
<s> jealously the music of dull sleep <\s>
<s> has life then with me been sorrow <\s>
<s> i do not regret <\s>
<s> pointing to her breast the bird is tired with flying <\s>
<s> touching her lips the flowers have no dew <\s>
<s> would you leave me <\s>
<s> there in a streak of the dawn against the plane tree is seen the shepherd of the cow horn standing wrapped in his mountain cloak <\s>
<s> he holds her fast i have shown you the marvels of my town the gay the bitter wonders <\s>
<s> we have known life <\s>
<s> if with you i may no longer live then let us die <\s>
<s> here are sweet deaths by slumber and by drowning <\s>
<s> the mandolin twangs out and from the dim doorway of the inn come forth the shadowy forms <\s>
<s> death by slumber and death by drowning <\s>
<s> who to a ghostly twanging of mandolins dance slowly towards seelchen <\s>
<s> stand smiling at her and as slowly dance away <\s>
<s> they are good and sweet <\s>
<s> while she moves towards the inn <\s>
<s> lamond's face becomes transfigured with joy <\s>
<s> but just as she reaches the doorway <\s>
<s> there is a distant chiming of bells and blowing of pipes and the shepherd of the cow horn sings to the wild grass come and the dull far roar of the falling rock to the flowery meads of thy mountain home where the eagles soar and the grizzled flock in the sunshine feeds <\s>
<s> to the alp where i in the pale light crowned with the moon's thin horns to my pasture roam to the silent sky and the wistful sound of the rosy dawns  my daughter come <\s>
<s> while he sings the sun has risen and seelchen has turned <\s>
<s> with parted lips and hands stretched out and the forms of death have vanished <\s>
<s> clasping her knees little soul <\s>
<s> must i then die like a gnat when the sun goes down <\s>
<s> without you i am nothing <\s>
<s> releasing herself poor heart i am gone <\s>
<s> he covers his face with his cloak <\s>
<s> then as seelchen reaches the shepherd of the cow horn there is blown a long note of a pipe the scene falls back and there rises a far continual mingled sound of cowbells and flower bells and pipes <\s>
<s> scene iv the scene slowly brightens with the misty flush of dawn <\s>
<s> seelchen stands on a green alp with all around nothing but blue sky <\s>
<s> a slip of a crescent moon is lying on her back <\s>
<s> on a low rock sits a brown faced goatherd blowing on a pipe and the four flower children are dancing in their shifts of grey white <\s>
<s> and blue rose pink and burnt gold <\s>
<s> their bells are ringing <\s>
<s> as they pelt each other with flowers of their own colours and each in turn wheeling flings one flower at seelchen who puts them to her lips and eyes <\s>
<s> she moves towards the rock goatherd <\s>
<s> but the flowers encircle him and when they wheel away he has vanished <\s>
<s> she turns to the flowers but they too vanish <\s>

<s> so thou hast come like a sick heifer to be healed <\s>
<s> was it good in the town that kept thee so long <\s>
<s> i do not regret <\s>
<s> never again shalt thou go from me <\s>
<s> mocking with what wilt thou keep me <\s>
<s> i have known change i am no timid maid <\s>
<s> moodily aye thou art different <\s>
<s> thine eyes are hollow thou art white faced <\s>
<s> still mocking then what hast thou here that shall keep me <\s>
<s> there is a faint wailing of wind <\s>
<s> the noise of the wind dies away <\s>
<s> yes it is lonely <\s>
<s> and the flowers shall dance to thee <\s>
<s> and to a ringing of their bells <\s>
<s> the flowers come dancing till one by one they cease and sink down nodding falling asleep <\s>
<s> even they grow sleepy here <\s>
<s> i will call the goats to wake them <\s>
<s> the goatherd is seen again sitting upright on his rock and piping <\s>
<s> and there come four little brown wild eyed naked boys with goat's legs and feet who dance gravely in and out of the sleeping flowers and the flowers wake spring up and fly <\s>
<s> till each goat catching his flower has vanished and the goatherd has ceased to pipe and lies motionless again on his rock <\s>
<s> i have no silver tongue <\s>
<s> this is my voice <\s>
<s> sweeping his arm round all the still alp it is quiet <\s>
<s> from dawn to the first star all is fast <\s>
<s> laying his hand on her heart and the wings of the birds shall be still <\s>
<s> touching his eyes thine eyes are fierce <\s>
<s> in them i see the wild beasts crouching <\s>
<s> in them i see the distance <\s>
<s> are they always fierce <\s>
<s> never to look on thee my flower <\s>
<s> touching his hands thy hands are rough to pluck flowers <\s>
<s> she breaks away from him to the rock where the goatherd is lying see <\s>
<s> the very day stands still <\s>
<s> but the goatherd neither stirs nor answers he is lost in the blue <\s>
<s> he will not answer me <\s>
<s> no one will answer me here <\s>
<s> with fierce longing am i then no one <\s>
<s> the scene darkens with evening see <\s>
<s> sleep has stolen the day <\s>

<s> there come the female shadow forms of sleep in grey cobweb garments waving their arms drowsily wheeling round her <\s>
<s> smiling she holds out her arms to felsman <\s>
<s> he takes her swaying form <\s>
<s> they vanish encircled by the forms of sleep <\s>
<s> it is dark save for the light of the thin horned moon suddenly grown bright <\s>
<s> then on his rock to a faint gaping the goatherd sings my goat my little speckled one <\s>
<s> let moon and wind and golden sun and stars beyond all telling make every day a sweeter grass <\s>
<s> and multiply thy leaping <\s>
<s> and may the mountain foxes pass and never scent thee sleeping <\s>
<s> let my pipe be clear and far <\s>
<s> and let me find sweet water <\s>
<s> no hawk nor udder seeking jar come near thee little daughter <\s>
<s> may fiery rocks defend at noon thy tender feet from slipping <\s>
<s> hear my prayer beneath the moon great master goat god skipping <\s>
<s> there passes in the thin moonlight the goat good pan and with a long wail of the pipe the goatherd boy is silent <\s>
<s> then the moon fades and all is black till in the faint grisly light of the false dawn creeping up seelchen is seen rising from the side of the sleeping felsman <\s>
<s> the goatherd boy has gone but by the rock stands the shepherd of the cow horn in his dock <\s>
<s> years years i have slept <\s>
<s> my spirit is hungry <\s>
<s> then as she sees the shepherd of the cow horn standing there i know thee now life of the earth the smell of thee the sight of thee the taste of thee and all thy music <\s>

<s> she moves away felsman <\s>
<s> waking where wouldst thou go <\s>
<s> to the edge of the world <\s>

<s> the time is on me <\s>

<s> was i too dull <\s>
<s> i do not regret <\s>
<s> the youth of the wine horn is seen suddenly standing opposite the motionless shepherd of the cow horn and his mandolin twangs out <\s>

<s> is it back to him thou wilt go <\s>
<s> groping for sight of the hated figure i cannot see <\s>
<s> i go ever onward <\s>
<s> do not leave me to the wind in the rocks <\s>
<s> without thee love is dead and i must die <\s>
<s> crouching against the rock it is cold <\s>
<s> at the blowing of the shepherd's pipe the cow horn stretches forth his hand to her <\s>

<s> the other of these two centre doors leads to the junior clerk's room <\s>
<s> the third door is that leading to the partners room <\s>

<s> he crosses to the outer office and passes through into it with a quizzical look at cokeson carefully leaving the door an inch or two open <\s>
<s> fortified by this look this won't do you know this won't do at all <\s>
<s> suppose one of the partners came in <\s>
<s> an incoherent knocking and chuckling is heard from the outer door of the outer office <\s>

<s> she takes a step towards cokeson cokeson <\s>

<s> it's a matter of life and death <\s>
<s> again outraged life and death <\s>
<s> falder has entered through the outer office <\s>
<s> he is a pale good looking young man with quick rather scared eyes <\s>

<s> well i'll give you a minute <\s>
<s> taking up a bundle of papers he goes out into the partners room <\s>

<s> they cling together passionately there fly apart just as cokeson re enters the room <\s>
<s> ruth turns and goes out through the outer office <\s>
<s> cokeson advances deliberately to his chair and seats himself <\s>
<s> this isn't right falder <\s>
<s> it shan't occur again sir <\s>
<s> it's an improper use of these premises <\s>
<s> you quite understand the party was in some distress and having children with her i allowed my feelings he opens a drawer and produces from it a tract just take this <\s>
<s> purity in the home <\s>
<s> it's a well written thing <\s>
<s> taking it with a peculiar expression thank you sir <\s>
<s> and look here falder before mr <\s>
<s> walter comes have you finished up that cataloguing davis had in hand before he left <\s>
<s> i shall have done with it to morrow sir for good <\s>
<s> it's over a week since davis went <\s>

<s> you're neglecting your work for private life <\s>
<s> i shan't mention about the party having called but falder <\s>
<s> passing into his room thank you sir <\s>
<s> cokeson stares at the door through which falder has gone out then shakes his head and is just settling down to write when walter how comes in through the outer office <\s>
<s> he is a rather refined looking man of thirty five with a pleasant almost apologetic voice <\s>
<s> always with a certain patronage as to a young man who might be doing better mr <\s>
<s> james has been here since eleven o'clock <\s>
<s> i've been in to see the pictures at the guildhall <\s>
<s> looking at him as though this were exactly what was to be expected have you now ye es <\s>
<s> this lease of boulter's am i to send it to counsel <\s>
<s> what does my father say <\s>
<s> well we can't be too careful <\s>
<s> it's such a little thing hardly worth the fees <\s>
<s> i thought you'd do it yourself <\s>
<s> i don't want the responsibility <\s>
<s> with an indescribable air of compassion just as you like <\s>
<s> this right of way case we've got em on the deeds <\s>
<s> i know but the intention was obviously to exclude that bit of common ground <\s>
<s> we needn't worry about that <\s>
<s> we're the right side of the law <\s>
<s> i don't like it cokeson <\s>
<s> with an indulgent smile we shan't want to set ourselves up against the law <\s>
<s> your father wouldn't waste his time doing that <\s>
<s> as he speaks james how comes in from the partners room <\s>
<s> he is a shortish man with white side whiskers plentiful grey hair shrewd eyes and gold pince nez <\s>
<s> how are you father <\s>
<s> looking down his nose at the papers in his hand as though deprecating their size i'll just take boulter's lease in to young falder to draft the instructions <\s>
<s> he goes out into falder's room walter <\s>
<s> about that right of way case <\s>
<s> oh well we must go forward there <\s>
<s> i thought you told me yesterday the firm's balance was over four hundred <\s>
<s> holding out the pass book to his son three five one no recent cheques <\s>
<s> just get me out the cheque book <\s>
<s> walter goes to a cupboard unlocks a drawer and produces a cheque book <\s>
<s> tick the pounds in the counterfoils <\s>
<s> five fifty four seven five twenty eight twenty ninety eleven fifty two seventy one <\s>
<s> made sure it was over four hundred <\s>
<s> give me the cheque book <\s>
<s> he takes the check book and cons the counterfoils what's this ninety <\s>
<s> taking the cheque book july 7th <\s>
<s> that's the day i went down to look over the trenton estate last friday week i came back on the tuesday you remember <\s>
<s> but look here father it was nine i drew a cheque for <\s>
<s> five guineas to smithers and my expenses <\s>
<s> it just covered all but half a crown <\s>
<s> gravely let's look at that ninety cheque <\s>
<s> he sorts the cheque out from the bundle in the pocket of the pass book seems all right <\s>
<s> there's no nine here <\s>
<s> who cashed that nine pound cheque <\s>
<s> puzzled and pained let's see <\s>
<s> i was finishing mrs <\s>
<s> reddy's will only just had time yes i gave it to cokeson <\s>
<s> look at that t y that yours <\s>
<s> after consideration my y's curl back a little this doesn't <\s>
<s> as cokeson re enters from falder's room we must ask him <\s>
<s> just come here and carry your mind back a bit cokeson <\s>
<s> d'you remember cashing a cheque for mr <\s>
<s> walter last friday week the day he went to trenton <\s>
<s> handing him the cheque cokeson <\s>
<s> my lunch was just coming in and of course i like it hot i gave the cheque to davis to run round to the bank <\s>
<s> he brought it back all gold you remember mr <\s>
<s> walter you wanted some silver to pay your cab <\s>
<s> with a certain contemptuous compassion here let me see <\s>
<s> you've got the wrong cheque <\s>
<s> he takes cheque book and pass book from walter <\s>
<s> having seen for himself it's funny <\s>
<s> you gave it to davis and davis sailed for australia on monday <\s>
<s> puzzled and upset why this'd be a felony <\s>
<s> there's never been anything of that sort in the office the twenty nine years i've been here <\s>
<s> looking at cheque and counterfoil this is a very clever bit of work a warning to you not to leave space after your figures walter <\s>
<s> vexed yes i know i was in such a tearing hurry that afternoon <\s>
<s> suddenly this has upset me <\s>
<s> the counterfoil altered too very deliberate piece of swindling <\s>
<s> what was davis's ship <\s>
<s> we ought to wire and have him arrested at naples he can't be there yet <\s>
<s> his poor young wife <\s>
<s> i liked the young man <\s>
<s> shall i go to the bank and ask the cashier <\s>
<s> grimly bring him round here <\s>
<s> and ring up scotland yard <\s>
<s> he goes out through the outer office <\s>
<s> james paces the room <\s>
<s> he stops and looks at cokeson who is disconsolately rubbing the knees of his trousers <\s>
<s> there's something in character isn't there <\s>
<s> looking at him over his spectacles i don't quite take you sir <\s>
<s> your story would sound d  d thin to any one who didn't know you <\s>
<s> then with a sudden gravity i'm sorry for that young man <\s>
<s> i feel it as if it was my own son mr <\s>
<s> all goes on regular and then a thing like this happens <\s>
<s> shan't relish my lunch to day <\s>
<s> as bad as that cokeson <\s>
<s> it makes you think <\s>
<s> confidentially he must have had temptation <\s>
<s> we haven't convicted him yet <\s>
<s> i'd sooner have lost a month's salary than had this happen <\s>
<s> i hope that fellow will hurry up <\s>
<s> keeping things pleasant for the cashier it isn't fifty yards mr <\s>
<s> he won't be a minute <\s>
<s> the idea of dishonesty about this office it hits me hard cokeson <\s>
<s> he goes towards the door of the partners room <\s>
<s> entering quietly to cokeson in a low voice she's popped up again sir something she forgot to say to falder <\s>
<s> roused from his abstraction eh <\s>
<s> here i'll come myself <\s>
<s> he goes into the outer office as james passes into the partners room now you really mustn't we can't have anybody just now <\s>
<s> not for a minute sir <\s>
<s> i can't have it <\s>
<s> if you want him wait about he'll be going out for his lunch directly <\s>
<s> walter entering with the cashier passes ruth as she leaves the outer office <\s>
<s> to the cashier who resembles a sedentary dragoon good morning <\s>
<s> to walter your father's in there <\s>
<s> walter crosses and goes into the partners room <\s>
<s> it's a nahsty unpleasant little matter mr <\s>
<s> i'm quite ashamed to have to trouble you <\s>
<s> i remember the cheque quite well <\s>
<s> as if it were a liver seemed in perfect order <\s>
<s> sit down won't you <\s>
<s> i'm not a sensitive man but a thing like this about the place it's not nice <\s>
<s> i like people to be open and jolly together <\s>
<s> buttonholing him and glancing toward the partners room of course he's a young man <\s>
<s> i've told him about it before now leaving space after his figures but he will do it <\s>
<s> i should remember the person's face quite a youth <\s>
<s> i don't think we shall be able to show him to you as a matter of fact <\s>
<s> james and walter have come back from the partners room <\s>
<s> you've seen my son and myself you've seen mr <\s>
<s> cokeson and you've seen sweedle my office boy <\s>
<s> it was none of us i take it <\s>
<s> the cashier shakes his head with a smile <\s>
<s> be so good as to sit there <\s>
<s> cowley in conversation will you <\s>
<s> he goes toward falder's room <\s>
<s> just a word mr <\s>
<s> you don't want to upset the young man in there do you <\s>
<s> he's a nervous young feller <\s>
<s> this must be thoroughly cleared up cokeson for the sake of falder's name to say nothing of yours <\s>
<s> with some dignity that'll look after itself sir <\s>
<s> he's been upset once this morning i don't want him startled again <\s>
<s> it's a matter of form but i can't stand upon niceness over a thing like this too serious <\s>
<s> just talk to mr <\s>
<s> he opens the door of falder's room <\s>
<s> bring in the papers in boulter's lease will you falder <\s>
<s> bursting into voice do you keep dogs <\s>
<s> the cashier with his eyes fixed on the door does not answer <\s>
<s> you haven't such a thing as a bulldog pup you could spare me i suppose <\s>
<s> at the look on the cashier's face his jaw drops and he turns to see falder standing in the doorway with his eyes fixed on cowley like the eyes of a rabbit fastened on a snake <\s>
<s> advancing with the papers here they are sir <\s>
<s> taking them thank you <\s>
<s> do you want me sir <\s>
<s> falder turns and goes back into his own room <\s>
<s> as he shuts the door james gives the cashier an interrogative look and the cashier nods <\s>
<s> this isn't as we suspected <\s>
<s> i suppose he can't slip out of that room <\s>
<s> gloomily there's only the window a whole floor and a basement <\s>
<s> the door of falder's room is quietly opened and falder with his hat in his hand moves towards the door of the outer office <\s>
<s> quietly where are you going falder <\s>
<s> to have my lunch sir <\s>
<s> wait a few minutes would you <\s>
<s> i want to speak to you about this lease <\s>
<s> he goes back into his room cowley <\s>
<s> if i'm wanted i can swear that's the young man who cashed the cheque <\s>
<s> it was the last cheque i handled that morning before my lunch <\s>
<s> these are the numbers of the notes he had <\s>
<s> he puts a slip of paper on the table then brushing his hat round good morning <\s>
<s> the cashier goes out through the outer office <\s>
<s> cokeson sits down in his chair as though it were the only place left in the morass of his feelings <\s>
<s> what are you going to do <\s>
<s> give me the cheque and the counterfoil <\s>
<s> i thought young davis james <\s>
<s> one moment father have you thought it out <\s>
<s> rising with difficulty and opening falder's door hoarsely step in here a minute <\s>
<s> turning to him suddenly with the cheque held out you know this cheque falder <\s>
<s> you cashed it last friday week <\s>
<s> yes sir that one davis gave it me <\s>
<s> and you gave davis the cash <\s>
<s> when davis gave you the cheque was it exactly like this <\s>
<s> yes i think so sir <\s>
<s> you know that mr <\s>
<s> walter drew that cheque for nine pounds <\s>
<s> faintly i don't understand sir <\s>
<s> the suggestion of course is that the cheque was altered whether by you or davis is the question <\s>
<s> take your time take your time <\s>
<s> regaining his impassivity not by me sir <\s>
<s> the cheque was handed to cokeson by mr <\s>
<s> walter at one o'clock we know that because mr <\s>
<s> cokeson's lunch had just arrived <\s>
<s> i couldn't leave it <\s>
<s> exactly he therefore gave the cheque to davis <\s>
<s> it was cashed by you at 1.15 <\s>
<s> we know that because the cashier recollects it for the last cheque he handled before his lunch <\s>
<s> yes sir davis gave it to me because some friends were giving him a farewell luncheon <\s>
<s> puzzled you accuse davis then <\s>
<s> i don't know sir it's very funny <\s>
<s> walter who has come close to his father says something to him in a low voice <\s>
<s> davis was not here again after that saturday was he <\s>
<s> anxious to be of assistance to the young man and seeing faint signs of their all being jolly once more no he sailed on the monday <\s>
<s> very faintly no sir <\s>
<s> very well then how do you account for the fact that this nought was added to the nine in the counterfoil on or after tuesday <\s>
<s> falder gives a sort of lurch he tries to pull himself together but he has gone all to pieces <\s>
<s> very grimly out i'm afraid cokeson <\s>
<s> the cheque book remained in mr <\s>
<s> walter's pocket till he came back from trenton on tuesday morning <\s>
<s> in the face of this falder do you still deny that you altered both cheque and counterfoil <\s>
<s> i did it sir i did it <\s>
<s> succumbing to his feelings dear dear <\s>
<s> what a thing to do <\s>
<s> i wanted the money so badly sir <\s>
<s> i didn't know what i was doing <\s>
<s> however such a thing could have come into your head <\s>
<s> grasping at the words i can't think sir really <\s>
<s> it was just a minute of madness <\s>
<s> a long minute falder <\s>
<s> tapping the counterfoil four days at least <\s>
<s> sir i swear i didn't know what i'd done till afterwards and then i hadn't the pluck <\s>
<s> sir look over it <\s>
<s> i'll pay the money back i will i promise <\s>
<s> go into your room <\s>
<s> falder with a swift imploring look goes back into his room <\s>
<s> about as bad a case as there could be <\s>
<s> to break the law like that in here <\s>
<s> what's to be done <\s>
<s> it's his first offence <\s>
<s> shaking his head i've grave doubts of that <\s>
<s> too neat a piece of swindling altogether <\s>
<s> i shouldn't be surprised if he was tempted <\s>
<s> life's one long temptation cokeson <\s>
<s> ye es but i'm speaking of the flesh and the devil mr <\s>
<s> there was a woman come to see him this morning <\s>
<s> the woman we passed as we came in just now <\s>
<s> is it his wife <\s>
<s> restraining what in jollier circumstances would have been a wink a married person though <\s>
<s> how do you know <\s>
<s> scandalised there they were outside the office <\s>
<s> a real bad egg <\s>
<s> i should like to give him a chance <\s>
<s> i can't forgive him for the sneaky way he went to work counting on our suspecting young davis if the matter came to light <\s>
<s> it was the merest accident the cheque book stayed in your pocket <\s>
<s> it must have been the temptation of a moment <\s>
<s> a man doesn't succumb like that in a moment if he's a clean mind and habits <\s>
<s> he's rotten got the eyes of a man who can't keep his hands off when there's money about <\s>
<s> dryly we hadn't noticed that before <\s>
<s> brushing the remark aside i've seen lots of those fellows in my time <\s>
<s> no doing anything with them except to keep em out of harm's way <\s>
<s> they've got a blind spat <\s>
<s> hesitating i don't see how it's possible to spare him <\s>
<s> out of the question to keep him in this office honesty's the sine qua non <\s>
<s> hypnotised of course it is <\s>
<s> equally out of the question to send him out amongst people who've no knowledge of his character <\s>
<s> one must think of society <\s>
<s> but to brand him like this <\s>
<s> if it had been a straightforward case i'd give him another chance <\s>
<s> it's far from that <\s>
<s> he has dissolute habits <\s>
<s> i didn't say that extenuating circumstances <\s>
<s> he's gone to work in the most cold blooded way to defraud his employers and cast the blame on an innocent man <\s>
<s> if that's not a case for the law to take its course i don't know what is <\s>
<s> for the sake of his future though <\s>
<s> sarcastically according to you no one would ever prosecute <\s>
<s> nettled i hate the idea of it <\s>
<s> that's rather ex parte mr <\s>
<s> we must have protection <\s>
<s> this is degenerating into talk <\s>
<s> he moves towards the partners room <\s>
<s> put yourself in his place father <\s>
<s> you ask too much of me <\s>
<s> we can't possibly tell the pressure there was on him <\s>
<s> you may depend on it my boy if a man is going to do this sort of thing he'll do it pressure or no pressure if he isn't nothing'll make him <\s>
<s> he'll never do it again <\s>
<s> fatuously s'pose i were to have a talk with him <\s>
<s> we don't want to be hard on the young man <\s>
<s> i've made up my mind <\s>
<s> he passes into the partners room cokeson <\s>
<s> after a doubtful moment we must excuse your father <\s>
<s> i don't want to go against your father if he thinks it right <\s>
<s> why don't you back me up <\s>
<s> you know you feel cokeson <\s>
<s> on his dignity i really can't say what i feel <\s>
<s> we shall regret it <\s>
<s> he must have known what he was doing <\s>
<s> bitterly the quality of mercy is not strained <\s>
<s> looking at him askance come come mr <\s>
<s> we must try and see it sensible <\s>
<s> entering with a tray your lunch sir <\s>
<s> while sweedle is putting it down on cokeson's table the detective wister enters the outer office and finding no one there comes to the inner doorway <\s>
<s> he is a square medium sized man clean shaved in a serviceable blue serge suit and strong boots <\s>
<s> what are we doing <\s>
<s> to walter from scotland yard sir <\s>
<s> i'll speak to my father <\s>
<s> he goes into the partners room <\s>
<s> in answer to an appealing gesture from cokeson i'm sorry i'd stop short of this if i felt i could <\s>
<s> sweedle wondering and scared opens it come here mr <\s>
<s> as falder comes shrinkingly out the detective in obedience to a sign from james slips his hand out and grasps his arm <\s>
<s> come come there's a good lad <\s>
<s> i charge him with felony <\s>
<s> there's some one i did it for her <\s>
<s> let me be till to morrow <\s>
<s> james motions with his hand <\s>
<s> at that sign of hardness falder becomes rigid <\s>
<s> then turning he goes out quietly in the detective's grip <\s>
<s> james follows stiff and erect <\s>
<s> sweedle rushing to the door with open mouth pursues them through the outer office into the corridor <\s>
<s> when they have all disappeared cokeson spins completely round and makes a rush for the outer office <\s>
<s> what are we doing <\s>
<s> he takes out his handkerchief and mops the sweat from his face <\s>
<s> going back blindly to his table sits down and stares blankly at his lunch <\s>
<s> act ii a court of justice on a foggy october afternoon crowded with barristers solicitors reporters ushers and jurymen <\s>
<s> sitting in the large solid dock is falder with a warder on either side of him placed there for his safe custody but seemingly indifferent to and unconscious of his presence <\s>
<s> falder is sitting exactly opposite to the judge who raised above the clamour of the court also seems unconscious of and indifferent to everything <\s>
<s> harold cleaver the counsel for the crown is a dried yellowish man of more than middle age in a wig worn almost to the colour of his face <\s>
<s> hector frome the counsel for the defence is a young tall man clean shaved in a very white wig <\s>
<s> among the spectators having already given their evidence are james and walter how and cowley the cashier <\s>
<s> wister the detective is just leaving the witness box <\s>
<s> that is the case for the crown me lud <\s>
<s> gathering his robes together he sits down <\s>
<s> rising and bowing to the judge if it please your lordship and gentlemen of the jury <\s>
<s> i am not going to dispute the fact that the prisoner altered this cheque but i am going to put before you evidence as to the condition of his mind and to submit that you would not be justified in finding that he was responsible for his actions at the time <\s>
<s> i am going to show you in fact that he did this in a moment of aberration amounting to temporary insanity caused by the violent distress under which he was labouring <\s>
<s> gentlemen the prisoner is only twenty three years old <\s>
<s> i shall call before you a woman from whom you will learn the events that led up to this act <\s>
<s> you will hear from her own lips the tragic circumstances of her life the still more tragic infatuation with which she has inspired the prisoner <\s>
<s> this woman gentlemen has been leading a miserable existence with a husband who habitually ill uses her from whom she actually goes in terror of her life <\s>
<s> i am not of course saying that it's either right or desirable for a young man to fall in love with a married woman or that it's his business to rescue her from an ogre like husband <\s>
<s> i'm not saying anything of the sort <\s>
<s> but we all know the power of the passion of love and i would ask you to remember gentlemen in listening to her evidence that married to a drunken and violent husband she has no power to get rid of him for as you know another offence besides violence is necessary to enable a woman to obtain a divorce and of this offence it does not appear that her husband is guilty <\s>
<s> is this relevant mr <\s>
<s> my lord i submit extremely i shall be able to show your lordship that directly <\s>
<s> in these circumstances what alternatives were left to her <\s>
<s> she could either go on living with this drunkard in terror of her life or she could apply to the court for a separation order <\s>
<s> well gentlemen my experience of such cases assures me that this would have given her very insufficient protection from the violence of such a man and even if effectual would very likely have reduced her either to the workhouse or the streets for it's not easy as she is now finding for an unskilled woman without means of livelihood to support herself and her children without resorting either to the poor law or to speak quite plainly to the sale of her body <\s>
<s> you are ranging rather far mr <\s>
<s> i shall fire point blank in a minute my lord <\s>
<s> let us hope so <\s>
<s> now gentlemen mark and this is what i have been leading up to this woman will tell you and the prisoner will confirm her that confronted with such alternatives she set her whole hopes on himself knowing the feeling with which she had inspired him <\s>
<s> she saw a way out of her misery by going with him to a new country where they would both be unknown and might pass as husband and wife <\s>
<s> this was a desperate and as my friend mr <\s>
<s> cleaver will no doubt call it an immoral resolution but as a fact the minds of both of them were constantly turned towards it <\s>
<s> one wrong is no excuse for another and those who are never likely to be faced by such a situation possibly have the right to hold up their hands as to that i prefer to say nothing <\s>
<s> but whatever view you take gentlemen of this part of the prisoner's story whatever opinion you form of the right of these two young people under such circumstances to take the law into their own hands the fact remains that this young woman in her distress and this young man little more than a boy who was so devotedly attached to her did conceive this if you like reprehensible design of going away together <\s>
<s> now for that of course they required money and they had none <\s>
<s> as to the actual events of the morning of july 7th on which this cheque was altered the events on which i rely to prove the defendant's irresponsibility i shall allow those events to speak for themselves through the lips of my witness <\s>
<s> he turns looks round takes up a sheet of paper and waits cokeson is summoned into court and goes into the witness box holding his hat before him <\s>
<s> the oath is administered to him <\s>
<s> what is your name <\s>
<s> are you managing clerk to the firm of solicitors who employ the prisoner <\s>
<s> how long had the prisoner been in their employ <\s>
<s> no i'm wrong there all but seventeen days <\s>
<s> had you him under your eye all that time <\s>
<s> except sundays and holidays <\s>
<s> let us hear please what you have to say about his general character during those two years <\s>
<s> confidentially to the jury and as if a little surprised at being asked he was a nice pleasant spoken young man <\s>
<s> i'd no fault to find with him quite the contrary <\s>
<s> it was a great surprise to me when he did a thing like that <\s>
<s> did he ever give you reason to suspect his honesty <\s>
<s> to have dishonesty in our office that'd never do <\s>
<s> i'm sure the jury fully appreciate that mr <\s>
<s> every man of business knows that honesty's the sign qua non <\s>
<s> do you give him a good character all round or do you not <\s>
<s> turning to the judge certainly <\s>
<s> we were all very jolly and pleasant together until this happened <\s>
<s> now coming to the morning of the 7th of july the morning on which the cheque was altered <\s>
<s> what have you to say about his demeanour that morning <\s>
<s> to the jury if you ask me i don't think he was quite compos when he did it <\s>
<s> sharply are you suggesting that he was insane <\s>
<s> a little more precision please <\s>
<s> smoothly just tell us mr <\s>
<s> somewhat outraged well in my opinion looking at the judge such as it is he was jumpy at the time <\s>
<s> the jury will understand my meaning <\s>
<s> will you tell us how you came to that conclusion <\s>
<s> i have my lunch in from the restaurant a chop and a potato saves time <\s>
<s> that day it happened to come just as mr <\s>
<s> walter how handed me the cheque <\s>
<s> well i like it hot so i went into the clerks office and i handed the cheque to davis the other clerk and told him to get change <\s>
<s> i noticed young falder walking up and down <\s>
<s> i said to him this is not the zoological gardens falder <\s>
<s> do you remember what he answered <\s>
<s> ye es i wish to god it were <\s>
<s> struck me as funny <\s>
<s> did you notice anything else peculiar <\s>
<s> his collar was unbuttoned <\s>
<s> now i like a young man to be neat <\s>
<s> i said to him your collar's unbuttoned <\s>
<s> and what did he answer <\s>
<s> isn't that a very common practice <\s>
<s> ye es but it was the look in his eyes <\s>
<s> i can't explain my meaning it was funny <\s>
<s> had you ever seen such a look in his eyes before <\s>
<s> if i had i should have spoken to the partners <\s>
<s> we can't have anything eccentric in our profession <\s>
<s> did you speak to them on that occasion <\s>
<s> confidentially well i didn't like to trouble them about prime facey evidence <\s>
<s> but it made a very distinct impression on your mind <\s>
<s> the clerk davis could have told you the same <\s>
<s> it's very unfortunate that we've not got him here <\s>
<s> now can you tell me of the morning on which the discovery of the forgery was made <\s>
<s> that would be the 18th <\s>
<s> did anything happen that morning <\s>
<s> with his hand to his ear i'm a little deaf <\s>
<s> was there anything in the course of that morning i mean before the discovery that caught your attention <\s>
<s> how is this relevant mr <\s>
<s> i am trying to establish the state of mind in which the prisoner committed this act my lord <\s>
<s> i quite appreciate that <\s>
<s> but this was long after the act <\s>
<s> yes my lord but it contributes to my contention <\s>
<s> you say a woman <\s>
<s> do you mean that she came to the office <\s>
<s> asked to see young falder he was out at the moment <\s>
<s> did you see her <\s>
<s> did she come alone <\s>
<s> confidentially well there you put me in a difficulty <\s>
<s> i mustn't tell you what the office boy told me <\s>
<s> cokeson quite so cokeson <\s>
<s> breaking in with an air of you are young leave it to me but i think we can get round it <\s>
<s> in answer to a question put to her by a third party the woman said to me they're mine sir <\s>
<s> how do you know <\s>
<s> your lordship mustn't ask me that or i shall have to tell you what i was told and that'd never do <\s>
<s> smiling the office boy made a statement <\s>
<s> what i want to ask you mr <\s>
<s> in the course of her appeal to see falder did the woman say anything that you specially remember <\s>
<s> looking at him as if to encourage him to complete the sentence a leetle more sir <\s>
<s> or did she not <\s>
<s> i shouldn't like you to have led me to the answer <\s>
<s> with an irritated smile will you tell the jury what it was <\s>
<s> it's a matter of life and death <\s>
<s> foreman of the jury <\s>
<s> do you mean the woman said that <\s>
<s> nodding it's not the sort of thing you like to have said to you <\s>
<s> a little impatiently did falder come in while she was there <\s>
<s> cokeson nods and she saw him and went away <\s>
<s> there i can't follow you <\s>
<s> i didn't see her go <\s>
<s> well is she there now <\s>
<s> with an indulgent smile no <\s>
<s> he sits down cleaver <\s>
<s> rising you say that on the morning of the forgery the prisoner was jumpy <\s>
<s> well now sir what precisely do you mean by that word <\s>
<s> indulgently i want you to understand <\s>
<s> have you ever seen a dog that's lost its master <\s>
<s> he was kind of everywhere at once with his eyes <\s>
<s> thank you i was coming to his eyes <\s>
<s> you called them funny <\s>
<s> what are we to understand by that <\s>
<s> sharply yes sir but what may be funny to you may not be funny to me or to the jury <\s>
<s> did they look frightened or shy or fierce or what <\s>
<s> you make it very hard for me <\s>
<s> i give you the word and you want me to give you another <\s>
<s> rapping his desk does funny mean mad <\s>
<s> not mad fun cleaver <\s>
<s> now you say he had his collar unbuttoned <\s>
<s> was it a hot day <\s>
<s> ye es i think it was <\s>
<s> and did he button it when you called his attention to it <\s>
<s> ye es i think he did <\s>
<s> would you say that that denoted insanity <\s>
<s> cokeson who has opened his mouth to reply is left gaping <\s>
<s> rising hastily have you ever caught him in that dishevelled state before <\s>
<s> he was always clean and quiet <\s>
<s> that will do thank you <\s>
<s> cokeson turns blandly to the judge as though to rebuke counsel for not remembering that the judge might wish to have a chance arriving at the conclusion that he is to be asked nothing further he turns and descends from the box and sits down next to james and walter <\s>
<s> ruth comes into court and takes her stand stoically in the witness box <\s>
<s> what is your name please <\s>
<s> how old are you <\s>
<s> you are a married woman living with your husband <\s>
<s> no sir not since july <\s>
<s> have you any children <\s>
<s> are they living with you <\s>
<s> you know the prisoner <\s>
<s> looking at him yes <\s>
<s> what was the nature of your relations with him <\s>
<s> sharply in what sense do you use that word <\s>
<s> we love each other <\s>
<s> shaking her head no your lordship not yet <\s>
<s> he looks from ruth to falder well <\s>
<s> what is your husband <\s>
<s> and what was the nature of your married life <\s>
<s> shaking her head it don't bear talking about <\s>
<s> did he ill treat you or what <\s>
<s> ever since my first was born <\s>
<s> i'd rather not say <\s>
<s> all sorts of ways <\s>
<s> i am afraid i must stop this you know <\s>
<s> pointing to falder he offered to take me out of it sir <\s>
<s> we were going to south america <\s>
<s> hastily yes quite and what prevented you <\s>
<s> i was outside his office when he was taken away <\s>
<s> it nearly broke my heart <\s>
<s> you knew then that he had been arrested <\s>
<s> i called at his office afterwards and pointing to cokeson that gentleman told me all about it <\s>
<s> now do you remember the morning of friday july 7th <\s>
<s> my husband nearly strangled me that morning <\s>
<s> bowing her head yes my lord <\s>
<s> with his hands or <\s>
<s> yes i just managed to get away from him <\s>
<s> i went straight to my friend <\s>
<s> it was eight o'clock <\s>
<s> your husband was not under the influence of liquor then <\s>
<s> it wasn't always that <\s>
<s> in what condition were you <\s>
<s> in very bad condition sir <\s>
<s> my dress was torn and i was half choking <\s>
<s> did you tell your friend what had happened <\s>
<s> i wish i never had <\s>
<s> did he ever speak to you about a cheque <\s>
<s> did he ever give you any money <\s>
<s> to buy an outfit for me and the children and get all ready to start <\s>
<s> did that surprise you or not <\s>
<s> that he had money to give you <\s>
<s> yes because on the morning when my husband nearly killed me my friend cried because he hadn't the money to get me away <\s>
<s> he told me afterwards he'd come into a windfall <\s>
<s> and when did you last see him <\s>
<s> the day he was taken away sir <\s>
<s> it was the day we were to have started <\s>
<s> oh yes the morning of the arrest <\s>
<s> well did you see him at all between the friday and that morning <\s>
<s> ruth nods what was his manner then <\s>
<s> dumb like sometimes he didn't seem able to say a word <\s>
<s> as if something unusual had happened to him <\s>
<s> painful or pleasant or what <\s>
<s> like a fate hanging over him <\s>
<s> hesitating tell me did you love the prisoner very much <\s>
<s> bowing her head yes <\s>
<s> and had he a very great affection for you <\s>
<s> looking at falder yes sir <\s>
<s> now ma'am do you or do you not think that your danger and unhappiness would seriously affect his balance his control over his actions <\s>
<s> for a moment like i think it would <\s>
<s> was he very much upset that friday morning or was he fairly calm <\s>
<s> i could hardly bear to let him go from me <\s>
<s> do you still love him <\s>
<s> with her eyes on falder he's ruined himself for me <\s>
<s> ruth remains stoically upright in the witness box <\s>
<s> in a considerate voice when you left him on the morning of friday the 7th you would not say that he was out of his mind i suppose <\s>
<s> thank you i've no further questions to ask you <\s>
<s> bending a little forward to the jury i would have done the same for him i would indeed <\s>
<s> you say your married life is an unhappy one <\s>
<s> faults on both sides <\s>
<s> only that i never bowed down to him <\s>
<s> i don't see why i should sir not to a man like that <\s>
<s> you refused to obey him <\s>
<s> avoiding the question i've always studied him to keep things nice <\s>
<s> until you met the prisoner was that it <\s>
<s> no even after that <\s>
<s> i ask you know because you seem to me to glory in this affection of yours for the prisoner <\s>
<s> it's the only thing in my life now <\s>
<s> staring at her hard well step down please <\s>
<s> ruth looks at falder then passes quietly down and takes her seat among the witnesses <\s>
<s> i call the prisoner my lord <\s>
<s> falder leaves the dock goes into the witness box and is duly sworn <\s>
<s> what is your name <\s>
<s> you are not married <\s>
<s> falder shakes his head frome <\s>
<s> how long have you known the last witness <\s>
<s> is her account of the relationship between you a correct one <\s>
<s> you became devotedly attached to her however <\s>
<s> though you knew she was a married woman <\s>
<s> i couldn't help it your lordship <\s>
<s> i didn't seem able to <\s>
<s> the judge slightly shrugs his shoulders <\s>
<s> how did you come to know her <\s>
<s> through my married sister <\s>
<s> did you know whether she was happy with her husband <\s>
<s> it was trouble all the time <\s>
<s> you knew her husband <\s>
<s> only through her he's a brute <\s>
<s> i can't allow indiscriminate abuse of a person not present <\s>
<s> bowing if your lordship pleases <\s>
<s> to falder you admit altering this cheque <\s>
<s> falder bows his head <\s>
<s> carry your mind please to the morning of friday july the 7th and tell the jury what happened <\s>
<s> turning to the jury i was having my breakfast when she came <\s>
<s> her dress was all torn and she was gasping and couldn't seem to get her breath at all there were the marks of his fingers round her throat her arm was bruised and the blood had got into her eyes dreadfully <\s>
<s> it frightened me and then when she told me i felt i felt well it was too much for me <\s>
<s> hardening suddenly if you'd seen it having the feelings for her that i had you'd have felt the same i know <\s>
<s> when she left me because i had to go to the office i was out of my senses for fear that he'd do it again and thinking what i could do <\s>
<s> i couldn't work all the morning i was like that simply couldn't fix my mind on anything <\s>
<s> i couldn't think at all <\s>
<s> i seemed to have to keep moving <\s>
<s> when davis the other clerk gave me the cheque he said it'll do you good will to have a run with this <\s>
<s> you seem half off your chump this morning <\s>
<s> then when i had it in my hand i don't know how it came but it just flashed across me that if i put the ty and the nought there would be the money to get her away <\s>
<s> it just came and went i never thought of it again <\s>
<s> then davis went out to his luncheon and i don't really remember what i did till i'd pushed the cheque through to the cashier under the rail <\s>
<s> i remember his saying gold or notes <\s>
<s> then i suppose i knew what i'd done <\s>
<s> anyway when i got outside i wanted to chuck myself under a bus i wanted to throw the money away but it seemed i was in for it so i thought at any rate i'd save her <\s>
<s> of course the tickets i took for the passage and the little i gave her's been wasted and all except what i was obliged to spend myself i've restored <\s>
<s> i keep thinking over and over however it was i came to do it and how i can't have it all again to do differently <\s>
<s> falder is silent twisting his hands before him <\s>
<s> how far is it from your office to the bank <\s>
<s> not more than fifty yards sir <\s>
<s> from the time davis went out to lunch to the time you cashed the cheque how long do you say it must have been <\s>
<s> it couldn't have been four minutes sir because i ran all the way <\s>
<s> during those four minutes you say you remember nothing <\s>
<s> no sir only that i ran <\s>
<s> not even adding the ty and the nought <\s>
<s> frome sits down and cleaver rises <\s>
<s> but you remember running do you <\s>
<s> i was all out of breath when i got to the bank <\s>
<s> and you don't remember altering the cheque <\s>
<s> divested of the romantic glamour which my friend is casting over the case is this anything but an ordinary forgery <\s>
<s> i was half frantic all that morning sir <\s>
<s> you don't deny that the ty and the nought were so like the rest of the handwriting as to thoroughly deceive the cashier <\s>
<s> it was an accident <\s>
<s> cheerfully queer sort of accident wasn't it <\s>
<s> on which day did you alter the counterfoil <\s>
<s> hanging his head on the wednesday morning <\s>
<s> was that an accident too <\s>
<s> to do that you had to watch your opportunity i suppose <\s>
<s> you don't suggest that you were suffering under great excitement when you did that <\s>
<s> with the fear of being found out <\s>
<s> didn't it occur to you that the only thing for you to do was to confess to your employers and restore the money <\s>
<s> there is silence cleaver <\s>
<s> you desired too no doubt to complete your design of taking this woman away <\s>
<s> when i found i'd done a thing like that to do it for nothing seemed so dreadful <\s>
<s> i might just as well have chucked myself into the river <\s>
<s> you knew that the clerk davis was about to leave england didn't it occur to you when you altered this cheque that suspicion would fall on him <\s>
<s> it was all done in a moment <\s>
<s> i thought of it afterwards <\s>
<s> and that didn't lead you to avow what you'd done <\s>
<s> sullenly i meant to write when i got out there i would have repaid the money <\s>
<s> but in the meantime your innocent fellow clerk might have been prosecuted <\s>
<s> i knew he was a long way off your lordship <\s>
<s> i thought there'd be time <\s>
<s> i didn't think they'd find it out so soon <\s>
<s> i might remind your lordship that as mr <\s>
<s> walter how had the cheque book in his pocket till after davis had sailed if the discovery had been made only one day later falder himself would have left and suspicion would have attached to him and not to davis from the beginning <\s>
<s> the question is whether the prisoner knew that suspicion would light on himself and not on davis <\s>
<s> to falder sharply did you know that mr <\s>
<s> walter how had the cheque book till after davis had sailed <\s>
<s> now speak the truth yes or no <\s>
<s> very low no my lord <\s>
<s> i had no means of knowing <\s>
<s> that disposes of your point mr <\s>
<s> frome bows to the judge cleaver <\s>
<s> has any aberration of this nature ever attacked you before <\s>
<s> you had recovered sufficiently to go back to your work that afternoon <\s>
<s> yes i had to take the money back <\s>
<s> you mean the nine pounds <\s>
<s> your wits were sufficiently keen for you to remember that <\s>
<s> and you still persist in saying you don't remember altering this cheque <\s>
<s> he sits down falder <\s>
<s> if i hadn't been mad i should never have had the courage <\s>
<s> rising did you have your lunch before going back <\s>
<s> i never ate a thing all day and at night i couldn't sleep <\s>
<s> now as to the four minutes that elapsed between davis's going out and your cashing the cheque do you say that you recollect nothing during those four minutes <\s>
<s> after a moment i remember thinking of mr <\s>
<s> had that any connection with what you were doing <\s>
<s> was that in the office before you ran out <\s>
<s> yes and while i was running <\s>
<s> and that lasted till the cashier said will you have gold or notes <\s>
<s> yes and then i seemed to come to myself and it was too late <\s>
<s> that closes the evidence for the defence my lord <\s>
<s> the judge nods and falder goes back to his seat in the dock <\s>
<s> gathering up notes if it please your lordship gentlemen of the jury my friend in cross examination has shown a disposition to sneer at the defence which has been set up in this case and i am free to admit that nothing i can say will move you if the evidence has not already convinced you that the prisoner committed this act in a moment when to all practical intents and purposes he was not responsible for his actions a moment of such mental and moral vacuity arising from the violent emotional agitation under which he had been suffering as to amount to temporary madness <\s>
<s> my friend has alluded to the romantic glamour with which i have sought to invest this case <\s>
<s> gentlemen i have done nothing of the kind <\s>
<s> i have merely shown you the background of life that palpitating life which believe me whatever my friend may say always lies behind the commission of a crime <\s>
<s> now gentlemen we live in a highly civilized age and the sight of brutal violence disturbs us in a very strange way even when we have no personal interest in the matter <\s>
<s> but when we see it inflicted on a woman whom we love what then <\s>
<s> just think of what your own feelings would have been each of you at the prisoner's age and then look at him <\s>
<s> he is hardly the comfortable shall we say bucolic person likely to contemplate with equanimity marks of gross violence on a woman to whom he was devotedly attached <\s>
<s> yes gentlemen look at him <\s>
<s> he has not a strong face but neither has he a vicious face <\s>
<s> he is just the sort of man who would easily become the prey of his emotions <\s>
<s> you have heard the description of his eyes <\s>
<s> my friend may laugh at the word funny i think it better describes the peculiar uncanny look of those who are strained to breaking point than any other word which could have been used <\s>
<s> i don't pretend mind you that his mental irresponsibility was more than a flash of darkness in which all sense of proportion became lost but to contend that just as a man who destroys himself at such a moment may be and often is absolved from the stigma attaching to the crime of self murder so he may and frequently does commit other crimes while in this irresponsible condition and that he may as justly be acquitted of criminal intent and treated as a patient <\s>
<s> i admit that this is a plea which might well be abused <\s>
<s> it is a matter for discretion <\s>
<s> but here you have a case in which there is every reason to give the benefit of the doubt <\s>
<s> you heard me ask the prisoner what he thought of during those four fatal minutes <\s>
<s> what was his answer <\s>
<s> i thought of mr <\s>
<s> gentlemen no man could invent an answer like that it is absolutely stamped with truth <\s>
<s> you have seen the great affection legitimate or not existing between him and this woman who came here to give evidence for him at the risk of her life <\s>
<s> it is impossible for you to doubt his distress on the morning when he committed this act <\s>
<s> we well know what terrible havoc such distress can make in weak and highly nervous people <\s>
<s> it was all the work of a moment <\s>
<s> the rest has followed as death follows a stab to the heart or water drops if you hold up a jug to empty it <\s>
<s> believe me gentlemen there is nothing more tragic in life than the utter impossibility of changing what you have done <\s>
<s> once this cheque was altered and presented the work of four minutes four mad minutes the rest has been silence <\s>
<s> but in those four minutes the boy before you has slipped through a door hardly opened into that great cage which never again quite lets a man go the cage of the law <\s>
<s> his further acts his failure to confess the alteration of the counterfoil his preparations for flight are all evidence not of deliberate and guilty intention when he committed the prime act from which these subsequent acts arose no they are merely evidence of the weak character which is clearly enough his misfortune <\s>
<s> but is a man to be lost because he is bred and born with a weak character <\s>
<s> gentlemen men like the prisoner are destroyed daily under our law for want of that human insight which sees them as they are patients and not criminals <\s>
<s> if the prisoner be found guilty and treated as though he were a criminal type he will as all experience shows in all probability become one <\s>
<s> i beg you not to return a verdict that may thrust him back into prison and brand him for ever <\s>
<s> gentlemen justice is a machine that when some one has once given it the starting push rolls on of itself <\s>
<s> is this young man to be ground to pieces under this machine for an act which at the worst was one of weakness <\s>
<s> is he to become a member of the luckless crews that man those dark ill starred ships called prisons <\s>
<s> is that to be his voyage from which so few return <\s>
<s> or is he to have another chance to be still looked on as one who has gone a little astray but who will come back <\s>
<s> i urge you gentlemen do not ruin this young man <\s>
<s> for as a result of those four minutes ruin utter and irretrievable stares him in the face <\s>
<s> he can be saved now <\s>
<s> imprison him as a criminal and i affirm to you that he will be lost <\s>
<s> he has neither the face nor the manner of one who can survive that terrible ordeal <\s>
<s> weigh in the scales his criminality and the suffering he has undergone <\s>
<s> the latter is ten times heavier already <\s>
<s> he has lain in prison under this charge for more than two months <\s>
<s> is he likely ever to forget that <\s>
<s> imagine the anguish of his mind during that time <\s>
<s> he has had his punishment gentlemen you may depend <\s>
<s> the rolling of the chariot wheels of justice over this boy began when it was decided to prosecute him <\s>
<s> we are now already at the second stage <\s>
<s> if you permit it to go on to the third i would not give that for him <\s>
<s> he holds up finger and thumb in the form of a circle drops his hand and sits dozen <\s>
<s> the jury stir and consult each other's faces then they turn towards the counsel for the crown who rises and fixing his eyes on a spot that seems to give him satisfaction slides them every now and then towards the jury <\s>
<s> may it please your lordship rising on his toes gentlemen of the jury the facts in this case are not disputed and the defence if my friend will allow me to say so is so thin that i don't propose to waste the time of the court by taking you over the evidence <\s>
<s> the plea is one of temporary insanity <\s>
<s> well gentlemen i daresay it is clearer to me than it is to you why this rather what shall we call it bizarre defence has been set up <\s>
<s> the alternative would have been to plead guilty <\s>
<s> now gentlemen if the prisoner had pleaded guilty my friend would have had to rely on a simple appeal to his lordship <\s>
<s> instead of that he has gone into the byways and hedges and found this er peculiar plea which has enabled him to show you the proverbial woman to put her in the box to give in fact a romantic glow to this affair <\s>
<s> i compliment my friend i think it highly ingenious of him <\s>
<s> by these means he has to a certain extent got round the law <\s>
<s> he has brought the whole story of motive and stress out in court at first hand in a way that he would not otherwise have been able to do <\s>
<s> but when you have once grasped that fact gentlemen you have grasped everything <\s>
<s> with good humoured contempt for look at this plea of insanity we can't put it lower than that <\s>
<s> you have heard the woman <\s>
<s> she has every reason to favour the prisoner but what did she say <\s>
<s> she said that the prisoner was not insane when she left him in the morning <\s>
<s> if he were going out of his mind through distress that was obviously the moment when insanity would have shown itself <\s>
<s> you have heard the managing clerk another witness for the defence <\s>
<s> with some difficulty i elicited from him the admission that the prisoner though jumpy a word that he seemed to think you would understand gentlemen and i'm sure i hope you do was not mad when the cheque was handed to davis <\s>
<s> i agree with my friend that it's unfortunate that we have not got davis here but the prisoner has told you the words with which davis in turn handed him the cheque he obviously therefore was not mad when he received it or he would not have remembered those words <\s>
<s> the cashier has told you that he was certainly in his senses when he cashed it <\s>
<s> we have therefore the plea that a man who is sane at ten minutes past one and sane at fifteen minutes past may for the purposes of avoiding the consequences of a crime call himself insane between those points of time <\s>
<s> really gentlemen this is so peculiar a proposition that i am not disposed to weary you with further argument <\s>
<s> you will form your own opinion of its value <\s>
<s> my friend has adopted this way of saying a great deal to you and very eloquently on the score of youth temptation and the like <\s>
<s> i might point out however that the offence with which the prisoner is charged is one of the most serious known to our law and there are certain features in this case such as the suspicion which he allowed to rest on his innocent fellow clerk and his relations with this married woman which will render it difficult for you to attach too much importance to such pleading <\s>
<s> i ask you in short gentlemen for that verdict of guilty which in the circumstances i regard you as unfortunately bound to record <\s>
<s> letting his eyes travel from the judge and the jury to frome he sits down <\s>
<s> bending a little towards the jury and speaking in a business like voice gentlemen you have heard the evidence and the comments on it <\s>
<s> my only business is to make clear to you the issues you have to try <\s>
<s> the facts are admitted so far as the alteration of this cheque and counterfoil by the prisoner <\s>
<s> the defence set up is that he was not in a responsible condition when he committed the crime <\s>
<s> well you have heard the prisoner's story and the evidence of the other witnesses so far as it bears on the point of insanity <\s>
<s> if you think that what you have heard establishes the fact that the prisoner was insane at the time of the forgery you will find him guilty but insane <\s>
<s> if on the other hand you conclude from what you have seen and heard that the prisoner was sane and nothing short of insanity will count you will find him guilty <\s>
<s> in reviewing the testimony as to his mental condition you must bear in mind very carefully the evidence as to his demeanour and conduct both before and after the act of forgery the evidence of the prisoner himself of the woman of the witness er cokeson and er of the cashier <\s>
<s> and in regard to that i especially direct your attention to the prisoner's admission that the idea of adding the ty and the nought did come into his mind at the moment when the cheque was handed to him and also to the alteration of the counterfoil and to his subsequent conduct generally <\s>
<s> the bearing of all this on the question of premeditation and premeditation will imply sanity is very obvious <\s>
<s> you must not allow any considerations of age or temptation to weigh with you in the finding of your verdict <\s>
<s> before you can come to a verdict of guilty but insane you must be well and thoroughly convinced that the condition of his mind was such as would have qualified him at the moment for a lunatic asylum <\s>
<s> he pauses then seeing that the jury are doubtful whether to retire or no adds :] you may retire gentlemen if you wish to do so <\s>
<s> the jury retire by a door behind the judge <\s>
<s> the judge bends over his notes <\s>
<s> falder leaning from the dock speaks excitedly to his solicitor pointing dawn at ruth <\s>
<s> the solicitor in turn speaks to frome <\s>
<s> the prisoner is very anxious that i should ask you if your lordship would kindly request the reporters not to disclose the name of the woman witness in the press reports of these proceedings <\s>
<s> your lordship will understand that the consequences might be extremely serious to her <\s>
<s> pointedly with the suspicion of a smile well mr <\s>
<s> frome you deliberately took this course which involved bringing her here <\s>
<s> with an ironic bow if your lordship thinks i could have brought out the full facts in any other way <\s>
<s> there is very real danger to her your lordship <\s>
<s> you see i have to take your word for all that <\s>
<s> if your lordship would be so kind <\s>
<s> i can assure your lordship that i am not exaggerating <\s>
<s> it goes very much against the grain with me that the name of a witness should ever be suppressed <\s>
<s> with a glance at falder who is gripping and clasping his hands before him and then at ruth who is sitting perfectly rigid with her eyes fixed on falder i'll consider your application <\s>
<s> i have to remember that she may have come here to commit perjury on the prisoner's behalf <\s>
<s> your lordship i really the judge <\s>
<s> yes yes i don't suggest anything of the sort mr <\s>
<s> leave it at that for the moment <\s>
<s> as he finishes speaking the jury return and file back into the box <\s>
<s> gentlemen are you agreed on your verdict <\s>
<s> is it guilty or guilty but insane <\s>
<s> the judge nods then gathering up his notes sits looking at falder who stands motionless <\s>
<s> rising if your lordship would allow me to address you in mitigation of sentence <\s>
<s> i don't know if your lordship thinks i can add anything to what i have said to the jury on the score of the prisoner's youth and the great stress under which he acted <\s>
<s> i don't think you can mr <\s>
<s> if your lordship says so i do most earnestly beg your lordship to give the utmost weight to my plea <\s>
<s> he sits down the judge <\s>
<s> to the clerk call upon him <\s>
<s> prisoner at the bar you stand convicted of felony <\s>
<s> have you anything to say for yourself why the court should not give you judgment according to law <\s>
<s> falder shakes his head the judge <\s>
<s> william falder you have been given fair trial and found guilty in my opinion rightly found guilty of forgery <\s>
<s> he pauses then consulting his notes goes on the defence was set up that you were not responsible for your actions at the moment of committing this crime <\s>
<s> there is no doubt i think that this was a device to bring out at first hand the nature of the temptation to which you succumbed <\s>
<s> for throughout the trial your counsel was in reality making an appeal for mercy <\s>
<s> the setting up of this defence of course enabled him to put in some evidence that might weigh in that direction <\s>
<s> whether he was well advised to so is another matter <\s>
<s> he claimed that you should be treated rather as a patient than as a criminal <\s>
<s> and this plea of his which in the end amounted to a passionate appeal he based in effect on an indictment of the march of justice which he practically accused of confirming and completing the process of criminality <\s>
<s> now in considering how far i should allow weight to his appeal i have a number of factors to take into account <\s>
<s> i have to consider on the one hand the grave nature of your offence the deliberate way in which you subsequently altered the counterfoil the danger you caused to an innocent man and that to my mind is a very grave point and finally i have to consider the necessity of deterring others from following your example <\s>
<s> on the other hand i have to bear in mind that you are young that you have hitherto borne a good character that you were if i am to believe your evidence and that of your witnesses in a state of some emotional excitement when you committed this crime <\s>
<s> i have every wish consistently with my duty not only to you but to the community to treat you with leniency <\s>
<s> and this brings me to what are the determining factors in my mind in my consideration of your case <\s>
<s> you are a clerk in a lawyer's office that is a very serious element in this case there can be no possible excuse made for you on the ground that you were not fully conversant with the nature of the crime you were committing and the penalties that attach to it <\s>
<s> it is said however that you were carried away by your emotions <\s>
<s> the story has been told here to day of your relations with this er mrs <\s>
<s> honeywill on that story both the defence and the plea for mercy were in effect based <\s>
<s> now what is that story <\s>
<s> it is that you a young man and she a young woman unhappily married had formed an attachment which you both say with what truth i am unable to gauge had not yet resulted in immoral relations but which you both admit was about to result in such relationship <\s>
<s> your counsel has made an attempt to palliate this on the ground that the woman is in what he describes i think as a hopeless position <\s>
<s> as to that i can express no opinion <\s>
<s> she is a married woman and the fact is patent that you committed this crime with the view of furthering an immoral design <\s>
<s> now however i might wish i am not able to justify to my conscience a plea for mercy which has a basis inimical to morality <\s>
<s> it is vitiated ab initio and would if successful free you for the completion of this immoral project <\s>
<s> your counsel has made an attempt to trace your offence back to what he seems to suggest is a defect in the marriage law he has made an attempt also to show that to punish you with further imprisonment would be unjust <\s>
<s> i do not follow him in these flights <\s>
<s> the law is what it is a majestic edifice sheltering all of us each stone of which rests on another <\s>
<s> i am concerned only with its administration <\s>
<s> the crime you have committed is a very serious one <\s>
<s> i cannot feel it in accordance with my duty to society to exercise the powers i have in your favour <\s>
<s> you will go to penal servitude for three years <\s>
<s> falder who throughout the judge's speech has looked at him steadily lets his head fall forward on his breast <\s>
<s> ruth starts up from her seat as he is taken out by the warders <\s>
<s> there is a bustle in court <\s>
<s> speaking to the reporters gentlemen of the press i think that the name of the female witness should not be reported <\s>
<s> the reporters bow their acquiescence <\s>
<s> to ruth who is staring in the direction in which falder has disappeared do you understand your name will not be mentioned <\s>
<s> pulling her sleeve the judge is speaking to you <\s>
<s> ruth turns stares at the judge and turns away <\s>
<s> i shall sit rather late to day <\s>
<s> call the next case <\s>

<s> a plainly furnished room with two large barred windows overlooking the prisoners exercise yard where men in yellow clothes marked with arrows and yellow brimless caps are seen in single file at a distance of four yards from each other walking rapidly on serpentine white lines marked on the concrete floor of the yard <\s>
<s> two warders in blue uniforms with peaked caps and swords are stationed amongst them <\s>
<s> the room has distempered walls a bookcase with numerous official looking books a cupboard between the windows a plan of the prison on the wall a writing table covered with documents <\s>
<s> it is christmas eve <\s>
<s> the governor a neat grave looking man with a trim fair moustache the eyes of a theorist and grizzled hair receding from the temples is standing close to this writing table looking at a sort of rough saw made out of a piece of metal <\s>
<s> the hand in which he holds it is gloved for two fingers are missing <\s>
<s> the chief warder wooder a tall thin military looking man of sixty with grey moustache and melancholy monkey like eyes stands very upright two paces from him <\s>
<s> with a faint abstracted smile queer looking affair mr <\s>
<s> where did you find it <\s>
<s> in his mattress sir <\s>
<s> haven't come across such a thing for two years now <\s>
<s> with curiosity had he any set plan <\s>
<s> he'd sawed his window bar about that much <\s>
<s> he holds up his thumb and finger a quarter of an inch apart the governor <\s>
<s> i'll see him this afternoon <\s>
<s> an old hand i think <\s>
<s> yes sir fourth spell of penal <\s>
<s> you'd think an old lag like him would have had more sense by now <\s>
<s> with pitying contempt occupied his mind he said <\s>
<s> breaking in and breaking out that's all they think about <\s>
<s> next him again there's that young fellow falder star class and next him old clipton <\s>
<s> i want to see him about his eyes <\s>
<s> curious thing sir they seem to know when there's one of these tries at escape going on <\s>
<s> it makes them restive there's a regular wave going through them just now <\s>
<s> meditatively odd things those waves <\s>
<s> turning to look at the prisoners exercising seem quiet enough out here <\s>
<s> that irishman o'cleary began banging on his door this morning <\s>
<s> little thing like that's quite enough to upset the whole lot <\s>
<s> they're just like dumb animals at times <\s>
<s> i've seen it with horses before thunder it'll run right through cavalry lines <\s>
<s> the prison chaplain has entered <\s>
<s> he is a dark haired ascetic man in clerical undress with a peculiarly steady tight lipped face and slow cultured speech <\s>
<s> holding up the saw seen this miller <\s>

<s> wooder motions to some one without and as the visitor comes in withdraws <\s>
<s> the visitor is cokeson who is attired in a thick overcoat to the knees woollen gloves and carries a top hat <\s>
<s> i'm sorry to trouble you <\s>
<s> i've been talking to the young man <\s>
<s> we have a good many here <\s>
<s> name of falder forgery <\s>
<s> producing a card and handing it to the governor firm of james and walter how <\s>
<s> well known in the law <\s>
<s> receiving the card with a faint smile what do you want to see me about sir <\s>
<s> suddenly seeing the prisoners at exercise why <\s>
<s> yes we have that privilege from here my office is being done up <\s>
<s> sitting down at his table now please <\s>
<s> dragging his eyes with difficulty from the window i wanted to say a word to you i shan't keep you long <\s>
<s> confidentially fact is i oughtn't to be here by rights <\s>
<s> his sister came to me he's got no father and mother and she was in some distress <\s>
<s> my husband won't let me go and see him she said says he's disgraced the family <\s>
<s> and his other sister she said is an invalid <\s>
<s> and she asked me to come <\s>
<s> well i take an interest in him <\s>
<s> he was our junior i go to the same chapel and i didn't like to refuse <\s>
<s> and what i wanted to tell you was he seems lonely here <\s>
<s> i'm afraid it'll prey on my mind <\s>
<s> i see a lot of them about working together <\s>
<s> those are local prisoners <\s>
<s> the convicts serve their three months here in separate confinement sir <\s>
<s> but we don't want to be unreasonable <\s>
<s> i wanted to ask you to let him run about with the others <\s>
<s> with faint amusement ring the bell would you miller <\s>
<s> to cokeson you'd like to hear what the doctor says about him perhaps <\s>
<s> ringing the bell you are not accustomed to prisons it would seem sir <\s>
<s> but it's a pitiful sight <\s>
<s> he's quite a young fellow <\s>
<s> i said to him before a month's up i said you'll be out and about with the others it'll be a nice change for you <\s>
<s> he said like that <\s>
<s> i said we mustn't exaggerate <\s>
<s> a day he said shut up in your cell thinking and brooding as i do it's longer than a year outside <\s>
<s> i can't help it he said i try but i'm built that way mr <\s>
<s> and he held his hand up to his face <\s>
<s> i could see the tears trickling through his fingers <\s>
<s> he's a young man with large rather peculiar eyes isn't he <\s>
<s> not church of england i think <\s>
<s> to wooder who has come in ask the doctor to be good enough to come here for a minute <\s>
<s> wooder salutes and goes out let's see he's not married <\s>
<s> confidentially but there's a party he's very much attached to not altogether com il fa <\s>
<s> it's a sad story <\s>
<s> if it wasn't for drink and women sir this prison might be closed <\s>
<s> looking at the chaplain over his spectacles ye es but i wanted to tell you about that special <\s>
<s> he had hopes they'd have let her come and see him but they haven't <\s>
<s> of course he asked me questions <\s>
<s> i did my best but i couldn't tell the poor young fellow a lie with him in here seemed like hitting him <\s>
<s> but i'm afraid it's made him worse <\s>
<s> what was this news then <\s>
<s> the woman had a nahsty spiteful feller for a husband and she'd left him <\s>
<s> fact is she was going away with our young friend <\s>
<s> it's not nice but i've looked over it <\s>
<s> well when he was put in here she said she'd earn her living apart and wait for him to come out <\s>
<s> that was a great consolation to him <\s>
<s> but after a month she came to me i don't know her personally and she said i can't earn the children's living let alone my own i've got no friends <\s>
<s> i'm obliged to keep out of everybody's way else my husband'd get to know where i was <\s>
<s> i'm very much reduced she said <\s>
<s> and she has lost flesh <\s>
<s> i'll have to go in the workhouse <\s>
<s> it's a painful story <\s>
<s> i said to her no i said not that <\s>
<s> i've got a wife an family but sooner than you should do that i'll spare you a little myself <\s>
<s> really she said she's a nice creature i don't like to take it from you <\s>
<s> i think i'd better go back to my husband <\s>
<s> well i know he's a nahsty spiteful feller drinks but i didn't like to persuade her not to <\s>
<s> ye es but i'm sorry now it's upset the poor young fellow dreadfully <\s>
<s> and what i wanted to say was he's got his three years to serve <\s>
<s> i want things to be pleasant for him <\s>
<s> with a touch of impatience the law hardly shares your view i'm afraid <\s>
<s> but i can't help thinking that to shut him up there by himself'll turn him silly <\s>
<s> and nobody wants that i s'pose <\s>
<s> i don't like to see a man cry <\s>
<s> it's a very rare thing for them to give way like that <\s>
<s> looking at him in a tone of sudden dogged hostility i keep dogs <\s>
<s> and i say this i wouldn't shut one of them up all by himself month after month not if he'd bit me all over <\s>
<s> unfortunately the criminal is not a dog he has a sense of right and wrong <\s>
<s> but that's not the way to make him feel it <\s>
<s> there i'm afraid we must differ <\s>
<s> it's the same with dogs <\s>
<s> if you treat em with kindness they'll do anything for you but to shut em up alone it only makes em savage <\s>
<s> surely you should allow those who have had a little more experience than yourself to know what is best for prisoners <\s>
<s> doggedly i know this young feller i've watched him for years <\s>
<s> he's eurotic got no stamina <\s>
<s> his father died of consumption <\s>
<s> i'm thinking of his future <\s>
<s> if he's to be kept there shut up by himself without a cat to keep him company it'll do him harm <\s>
<s> i said to him where do you feel it <\s>
<s> i can't tell you mr <\s>
<s> cokeson he said but sometimes i could beat my head against the wall <\s>
<s> during this speech the doctor has entered <\s>
<s> he is a medium sized rather good looking man with a quick eye <\s>
<s> he stands leaning against the window <\s>
<s> this gentleman thinks the separate is telling on q 3007 falder young thin fellow star class <\s>
<s> what do you say doctor clements <\s>
<s> he doesn't like it but it's not doing him any harm <\s>
<s> but he's told me <\s>
<s> of course he'd say so but we can always tell <\s>
<s> he's lost no weight since he's been here <\s>
<s> it's his state of mind i'm speaking of <\s>
<s> his mind's all right so far <\s>
<s> he's nervous rather melancholy <\s>
<s> i don't see signs of anything more <\s>
<s> i'm watching him carefully <\s>
<s> nonplussed i'm glad to hear you say that <\s>
<s> more suavely it's just at this period that we are able to make some impression on them sir <\s>
<s> i am speaking from my special standpoint <\s>
<s> turning bewildered to the governor i don't want to be unpleasant but having given him this news i do feel it's awkward <\s>
<s> i'll make a point of seeing him to day <\s>
<s> i'm much obliged to you <\s>
<s> i thought perhaps seeing him every day you wouldn't notice it <\s>
<s> rather sharply if any sign of injury to his health shows itself his case will be reported at once <\s>
<s> that's fully provided for <\s>
<s> following his own thoughts of course what you don't see doesn't trouble you but having seen him i don't want to have him on my mind <\s>
<s> i think you may safely leave it to us sir <\s>
<s> mollified and apologetic i thought you'd understand me <\s>
<s> i'm a plain man never set myself up against authority <\s>
<s> expanding to the chaplain nothing personal meant <\s>
<s> as he goes out the three officials do not look at each other but their faces wear peculiar expressions <\s>
<s> our friend seems to think that prison is a hospital <\s>
<s> returning suddenly with an apologetic air there's just one little thing <\s>
<s> this woman i suppose i mustn't ask you to let him see her <\s>
<s> it'd be a rare treat for them both <\s>
<s> he's thinking about her all the time <\s>
<s> of course she's not his wife <\s>
<s> but he's quite safe in here <\s>
<s> they're a pitiful couple <\s>
<s> you couldn't make an exception <\s>
<s> wearily as you say my dear sir i couldn't make an exception he won't be allowed another visit of any sort till he goes to a convict prison <\s>
<s> rather coldly sorry to have troubled you <\s>
<s> he again goes out the chaplain <\s>
<s> shrugging his shoulders the plain man indeed poor fellow <\s>

<s> i must have something to interest me <\s>
<s> you've made me a sporting offer sir but i can't pass my word about it <\s>
<s> i shouldn't like to deceive a gentleman <\s>
<s> pointing into the cell another four hours steady work would have done it <\s>
<s> yes and what then <\s>
<s> caught brought back punishment <\s>
<s> five weeks hard work to make this and cells at the end of it while they put anew bar to your window <\s>
<s> is it worth it moaney <\s>
<s> with a sort of fierceness yes it is <\s>

<s> the governor looks after him and shakes his head as wooder closes and locks the cell door <\s>
<s> wooder opens the door of clipton's cell <\s>
<s> clipton is sitting on a stool just inside the door at work on a pair of trousers <\s>
<s> he is a small thick oldish man with an almost shaven head and smouldering little dark eyes behind smoked spectacles <\s>
<s> he gets up and stands motionless in the doorway peering at his visitors <\s>
<s> beckoning come out here a minute clipton <\s>
<s> clipton with a sort of dreadful quietness comes into the corridor the needle and thread in his hand <\s>
<s> the governor signs to wooder who goes into the cell and inspects it carefully <\s>
<s> how are your eyes <\s>
<s> i don't complain of them <\s>
<s> i don't see the sun here <\s>
<s> he makes a stealthy movement protruding his neck a little there's just one thing mr <\s>
<s> governor as you're speaking to me <\s>
<s> i wish you'd ask the cove next door here to keep a bit quieter <\s>
<s> i don't want any tales clipton <\s>
<s> he keeps me awake <\s>
<s> i don't know who he is <\s>
<s> with contempt one of this star class i expect <\s>

<s> in the evening too <\s>
<s> it's not fair mr <\s>
<s> governor as you're speaking to me <\s>
<s> sleep's the comfort i've got here i'm entitled to take it out full <\s>
<s> wooder comes out of the cell and instantly as though extinguished clipton moves with stealthy suddenness back into his cell <\s>
<s> the door is closed and locked <\s>
<s> which is the man who banged on his door this morning <\s>
<s> going towards o'cleary's cell this one sir o'cleary <\s>
<s> he lifts the disc and glances through the peephole <\s>
<s> wooder throws open the door <\s>
<s> o'cleary who is seated at a little table by the door as if listening springs up and stands at attention jest inside the doorway <\s>
<s> he is a broad faced middle aged man with a wide thin flexible mouth and little holes under his high cheek bones <\s>
<s> where's the joke o'cleary <\s>
<s> the joke your honour <\s>
<s> i've not seen one for a long time <\s>
<s> banging on your door <\s>

<s> but it's the great conversation i'd have <\s>
<s> with a smile well no more conversation on your door <\s>
<s> no sirr i wud not have the little wit to repeat meself <\s>
<s> he turns into his cell <\s>
<s> the governor shuts the door <\s>
<s> looking at the record card can't help liking the poor blackguard <\s>
<s> he's an amiable man sir <\s>
<s> pointing down the corridor ask the doctor to come here mr <\s>
<s> wooder salutes and goes away down the corridor <\s>
<s> the governor goes to the door of falder's cell <\s>
<s> he raises his uninjured hand to uncover the peep hole but without uncovering it shakes his head and drops his hand then after scrutinising the record board he opens the cell door <\s>
<s> falder who is standing against it lurches forward <\s>
<s> beckoning him out now tell me can't you settle down falder <\s>
<s> in a breathless voice yes sir <\s>
<s> you know what i mean <\s>
<s> it's no good running your head against a stone wall is it <\s>
<s> between two o'clock and getting up's the worst time <\s>
<s> his lips twitch with a sort of smile i don't know sir <\s>
<s> i was always nervous <\s>
<s> suddenly voluble everything seems to get such a size then <\s>
<s> i feel i'll never get out as long as i live <\s>
<s> that's morbid my lad <\s>
<s> with an equally sudden dogged resentment yes i've got to <\s>
<s> think of all these other fellows <\s>
<s> they're used to it <\s>
<s> they all had to go through it once for the first time just as you're doing now <\s>
<s> yes sir i shall get to be like them in time i suppose <\s>
<s> rather taken aback h'm <\s>
<s> that rests with you <\s>
<s> set your mind to it like a good fellow <\s>
<s> you're still quite young <\s>
<s> a man can make himself what he likes <\s>
<s> take a good hold of yourself <\s>
<s> i don't take the words in <\s>
<s> hanging his head i know it's no good but i can't help thinking of what's going on outside <\s>
<s> in my cell i can't see out at all <\s>
<s> it's thick glass sir <\s>
<s> you've had a visitor <\s>
<s> you mustn't think about it <\s>
<s> looking back at his cell how can i help it sir <\s>
<s> he suddenly becomes motionless as wooder and the doctor approach <\s>
<s> the governor motions to him to go back into his cell <\s>
<s> quick and low i'm quite right in my head sir <\s>
<s> he goes back into his cell the governor <\s>
<s> to the doctor just go in and see him clements <\s>
<s> the doctor goes into the cell <\s>
<s> the governor pushes the door to nearly closing it and walks towards the window <\s>
<s> following sorry you should be troubled like this sir <\s>
<s> very contented lot of men on the whole <\s>
<s> shortly you think so <\s>
<s> it's christmas doing it in my opinion <\s>
<s> to himself queer that <\s>
<s> he turns towards the window leaving wooder looking at him with a sort of pained anxiety <\s>
<s> suddenly do you think we make show enough sir <\s>
<s> if you'd like us to have more holly <\s>
<s> not at all mr <\s>
<s> the doctor has come out of falder's cell and the governor beckons to him <\s>
<s> i can't make anything much of him <\s>
<s> he's nervous of course <\s>
<s> is there any sort of case to report <\s>
<s> well i don't think the separates doing him any good but then i could say the same of a lot of them they'd get on better in the shops there's no doubt <\s>
<s> you mean you'd have to recommend others <\s>
<s> a dozen at least <\s>
<s> it's on his nerves <\s>
<s> that fellow there pointing to o'cleary's cell for instance feels it just as much in his way <\s>
<s> if i once get away from physical facts i shan't know where i am <\s>
<s> conscientiously sir i don't know how to differentiate him <\s>
<s> he hasn't lost weight <\s>
<s> nothing wrong with his eyes <\s>
<s> his pulse is good <\s>
<s> it doesn't amount to melancholia <\s>
<s> shaking his head i can report on him if you like but if i do i ought to report on others <\s>
<s> looking towards falder's cell the poor devil must just stick it then <\s>
<s> as he says thin he looks absently at wooder <\s>
<s> for answer the governor stares at him turns on his heel and walks away <\s>
<s> there is a sound as of beating on metal <\s>
<s> banging on his door sir <\s>
<s> i thought we should have more of that <\s>
<s> he hurries forward passing the governor who follows closely <\s>
<s> scene iii falder's cell a whitewashed space thirteen feet broad by seven deep and nine feet high with a rounded ceiling <\s>
<s> the floor is of shiny blackened bricks <\s>
<s> the barred window of opaque glass with a ventilator is high up in the middle of the end wall <\s>
<s> in the middle of the opposite end wall is the narrow door <\s>
<s> in a corner are the mattress and bedding rolled up two blankets two sheets and a coverlet <\s>
<s> above them is a quarter circular wooden shelf on which is a bible and several little devotional books piled in a symmetrical pyramid there are also a black hair brush tooth brush and a bit of soap <\s>
<s> in another corner is the wooden frame of a bed standing on end <\s>
<s> there is a dark ventilator under the window and another over the door <\s>
<s> falder's work a shirt to which he is putting buttonholes is hung to a nail on the wall over a small wooden table on which the novel lorna doone lies open <\s>
<s> low down in the corner by the door is a thick glass screen about a foot square covering the gas jet let into the wall <\s>
<s> there is also a wooden stool and a pair of shoes beneath it <\s>
<s> three bright round tins are set under the window <\s>
<s> in fast failing daylight falder in his stockings is seen standing motionless with his head inclined towards the door listening <\s>
<s> he moves a little closer to the door his stockinged feet making no noise <\s>
<s> he stops at the door <\s>
<s> he is trying harder and harder to hear something any little thing that is going on outside <\s>
<s> he springs suddenly upright as if at a sound and remains perfectly motionless <\s>
<s> then with a heavy sigh he moves to his work and stands looking at it with his head doom he does a stitch or two having the air of a man so lost in sadness that each stitch is as it were a coming to life <\s>
<s> then turning abruptly he begins pacing the cell moving his head like an animal pacing its cage <\s>
<s> he stops again at the door listens and placing the palms of hip hands against it with his fingers spread out leans his forehead against the iron <\s>
<s> turning from it presently he moves slowly back towards the window tracing his way with his finger along the top line of the distemper that runs round the wall <\s>
<s> he stops under the window and picking up the lid of one of the tins peers into it <\s>
<s> it has grown very nearly dark <\s>
<s> suddenly the lid falls out of his hand with a clatter the only sound that has broken the silence and he stands staring intently at the wall where the stuff of the shirt is hanging rather white in the darkness he seems to be seeing somebody or something there <\s>
<s> there is a sharp tap and click the cell light behind the glass screen has been turned up <\s>
<s> the cell is brightly lighted <\s>
<s> falder is seen gasping for breath <\s>
<s> a sound from far away as of distant dull beating on thick metal is suddenly audible <\s>
<s> falder shrinks back not able to bear this sudden clamour <\s>
<s> but the sound grows as though some great tumbril were rolling towards the cell <\s>
<s> and gradually it seems to hypnotise him <\s>
<s> he begins creeping inch by inch nearer to the door <\s>
<s> the banging sound travelling from cell to cell draws closer and closer falder's hands are seen moving as if his spirit had already joined in this beating and the sound swells till it seems to have entered the very cell <\s>
<s> he suddenly raises his clenched fists <\s>
<s> panting violently he flings himself at his door and beats on it <\s>
<s> act iv the scene is again cokeson's room at a few minutes to ten of a march morning two years later <\s>
<s> the doors are all open <\s>
<s> sweedle now blessed with a sprouting moustache is getting the offices ready <\s>
<s> he arranges papers on cokeson's table then goes to a covered washstand raises the lid and looks at himself in the mirror <\s>
<s> while he is gazing his full ruth honeywill comes in through the outer office and stands in the doorway <\s>
<s> there seems a kind of exultation and excitement behind her habitual impassivity <\s>
<s> suddenly seeing her and dropping the lid of the washstand with a bang hello <\s>
<s> there's only me here <\s>
<s> they don't waste their time hurrying down in the morning <\s>
<s> why it must be two years since we had the pleasure of seeing you <\s>
<s> nervously what have you been doing with yourself <\s>
<s> impressed if you want to see him he points to cokeson's chair he'll be here directly never misses not much <\s>
<s> delicately i hope our friend's back from the country <\s>
<s> his time's been up these three months if i remember <\s>
<s> ruth nods i was awful sorry about that <\s>
<s> the governor made a mistake if you ask me <\s>
<s> he ought to have given him a chanst <\s>
<s> and i say the judge ought to ha let him go after that <\s>
<s> they've forgot what human nature's like <\s>
<s> ruth gives him a honeyed smile sweedle <\s>
<s> they come down on you like a cartload of bricks flatten you out and when you don't swell up again they complain of it <\s>
<s> i know em seen a lot of that sort of thing in my time <\s>
<s> he shakes his head in the plenitude of wisdom why only the other day the governor but cokeson has come in through the outer office brisk with east wind and decidedly greyer <\s>
<s> drawing off his coat and gloves why <\s>
<s> then motioning sweedle out and closing the door quite a stranger <\s>
<s> must be two years <\s>
<s> d'you want to see me <\s>
<s> i can give you a minute <\s>
<s> i'm not living where i was <\s>
<s> eyeing her askance i hope things are more comfortable at home <\s>
<s> i couldn't stay with honeywill after all <\s>
<s> you haven't done anything rash i hope <\s>
<s> i should be sorry if you'd done anything rash <\s>
<s> i've kept the children with me <\s>
<s> beginning to feel that things are not so jolly as ha had hoped well i'm glad to have seen you <\s>
<s> you've not heard from the young man i suppose since he came out <\s>
<s> yes i ran across him yesterday <\s>
<s> i hope he's well <\s>
<s> with sudden fierceness he can't get anything to do <\s>
<s> it's dreadful to see him <\s>
<s> he's just skin and bone <\s>
<s> with genuine concern dear me <\s>
<s> i'm sorry to hear that <\s>
<s> on his guard again didn't they find him a place when his time was up <\s>
<s> he was only there three weeks <\s>
<s> i'm sure i don't know what i can do for you <\s>
<s> i don't like to be snubby <\s>
<s> i can't bear his being like that <\s>
<s> scanning her not unprosperous figure i know his relations aren't very forthy about him <\s>
<s> perhaps you can do something for him till he finds his feet <\s>
<s> i could have but not now <\s>
<s> proudly i've seen him again that's all over <\s>
<s> staring at her disturbed i'm a family man i don't want to hear anything unpleasant <\s>
<s> excuse me i'm very busy <\s>
<s> i'd have gone home to my people in the country long ago but they've never got over me marrying honeywill <\s>
<s> i never was waywise mr <\s>
<s> cokeson but i'm proud <\s>
<s> i was only a girl you see when i married him <\s>
<s> i thought the world of him of course <\s>
<s> he used to come travelling to our farm <\s>
<s> regretfully i did hope you'd have got on better after you saw me <\s>
<s> he used me worse than ever <\s>
<s> he couldn't break my nerve but i lost my health and then he began knocking the children about <\s>
<s> i couldn't stand that <\s>
<s> i wouldn't go back now if he were dying <\s>
<s> who has risen and is shifting about as though dodging a stream of lava we mustn't be violent must we <\s>
<s> smouldering a man that can't behave better than that there is silence cokeson <\s>
<s> fascinated in spite of himself then there you were <\s>
<s> and what did you do then <\s>
<s> with a shrug tried the same as when i left him before ... making skirts ... <\s>
<s> it was the best i could get but i never made more than ten shillings a week buying my own cotton and working all day i hardly ever got to bed till past twelve <\s>
<s> i kept at it for nine months <\s>
<s> fiercely well i'm not fit for that i wasn't made for it <\s>
<s> we mustn't talk like that <\s>
<s> it was starvation for the children too after what they'd always had <\s>
<s> i soon got not to care <\s>
<s> i used to be too tired <\s>
<s> she is silent cokeson <\s>
<s> with fearful curiosity why what happened then <\s>
<s> with a laugh my employer happened then he's happened ever since <\s>
<s> i never came across a thing like this <\s>
<s> dully he's treated me all right <\s>
<s> but i've done with that <\s>
<s> suddenly her lips begin to quiver and she hides them with the back of her hand i never thought i'd see him again you see <\s>
<s> it was just a chance i met him by hyde park <\s>
<s> we went in there and sat down and he told me all about himself <\s>
<s> cokeson give him another chance <\s>
<s> greatly disturbed then you've both lost your livings <\s>
<s> what a horrible position <\s>
<s> if he could only get here where there's nothing to find out about him <\s>
<s> we can't have anything derogative to the firm <\s>
<s> i've no one else to go to <\s>
<s> i'll speak to the partners but i don't think they'll take him under the circumstances <\s>
<s> he came with me he's down there in the street <\s>
<s> she points to the window cokeson <\s>
<s> on his dignity he shouldn't have done that until he's sent for <\s>
<s> then softening at the look on her face we've got a vacancy as it happens but i can't promise anything <\s>
<s> it would be the saving of him <\s>
<s> well i'll do what i can but i'm not sanguine <\s>
<s> now tell him that i don't want him till i see how things are <\s>
<s> repeating her 83 mullingar street <\s>
<s> he notes it on blotting paper good morning <\s>
<s> she moves towards the door turns as if to speak but does not and goes away <\s>
<s> wiping his head and forehead with a large white cotton handkerchief what a business <\s>
<s> then looking amongst his papers he sounds his bell <\s>
<s> sweedle answers it cokeson <\s>
<s> was that young richards coming here to day after the clerk's place <\s>
<s> well keep him in the air i don't want to see him yet <\s>
<s> what shall i tell him sir <\s>
<s> with asperity invent something <\s>
<s> don't stump him off altogether <\s>
<s> shall i tell him that we've got illness sir <\s>
<s> say i'm not here to day <\s>
<s> i may be having him round to see me <\s>
<s> now treat him like you'd have him treat you in a similar position <\s>
<s> i naturally should do <\s>
<s> when a man's down never hit im <\s>
<s> give him a hand up <\s>
<s> that's a metaphor i recommend to you in life <\s>
<s> do you think the governors will take him on again sir <\s>
<s> can't say anything about that <\s>
<s> at the sound of some one having entered the outer office who's there <\s>
<s> going to the door and looking it's falder sir <\s>
<s> that's very naughty of her <\s>
<s> tell him to call again <\s>
<s> i don't want he breaks off as falder comes in <\s>
<s> falder is thin pale older his eyes have grown more restless <\s>
<s> his clothes are very worn and loose <\s>
<s> sweedle nodding cheerfully withdraws <\s>
<s> glad to see you <\s>
<s> trying to keep things pleasant shake hands <\s>
<s> she's striking while the iron's hot <\s>
<s> he wipes his forehead i don't blame her <\s>
<s> falder timidly takes cokeson's hand and glances towards the partners door <\s>
<s> falder sits in the chair at the aide of cokeson's table on which he places his cap now you are here i'd like you to give me a little account of yourself <\s>
<s> looking at him over his spectacles how's your health <\s>
<s> preoccupied i'm glad to hear that <\s>
<s> i don't like doing anything out of the ordinary it's not my habit <\s>
<s> i'm a plain man and i want everything smooth and straight <\s>
<s> but i promised your friend to speak to the partners and i always keep my word <\s>
<s> i just want a chance mr <\s>
<s> i've paid for that job a thousand times and more <\s>
<s> they say i weighed more when i came out than when i went in <\s>
<s> they couldn't weigh me here he touches his head or here he touches his heart and gives a sort of laugh <\s>
<s> till last night i'd have thought there was nothing in here at all <\s>
<s> concerned you've not got heart disease <\s>
<s> they passed me sound enough <\s>
<s> but they got you a place didn't they <\s>
<s> yes very good people knew all about it very kind to me <\s>
<s> i thought i was going to get on first rate <\s>
<s> but one day all of a sudden the other clerks got wind of it .... <\s>
<s> i couldn't stick it mr <\s>
<s> cokeson i couldn't sir <\s>
<s> easy my dear fellow easy <\s>
<s> i had one small job after that but it didn't last <\s>
<s> it's no good deceiving you mr <\s>
<s> the fact is i seem to be struggling against a thing that's all round me <\s>
<s> i can't explain it it's as if i was in a net as fast as i cut it here it grows up there <\s>
<s> i didn't act as i ought to have about references but what are you to do <\s>
<s> you must have them <\s>
<s> and that made me afraid and i left <\s>
<s> in fact i'm i'm afraid all the time now <\s>
<s> he bows his head and leans dejectedly silent over the table <\s>
<s> i feel for you i do really <\s>
<s> aren't your sisters going to do anything for you <\s>
<s> and the other cokeson <\s>
<s> she told me her husband wasn't quite pleased with you <\s>
<s> when i went there they were at supper my sister wanted to give me a kiss i know <\s>
<s> but he just looked at her and said what have you come for <\s>
<s> well i pocketed my pride and i said aren't you going to give me your hand jim <\s>
<s> cis is i know i said <\s>
<s> he said that's all very well but we'd better come to an understanding <\s>
<s> i've been expecting you and i've made up my mind <\s>
<s> i'll give you fifteen pounds to go to canada with <\s>
<s> i see i said good riddance <\s>
<s> no thanks keep your fifteen pounds <\s>
<s> friendship's a queer thing when you've been where i have <\s>
<s> will you take the fifteen pound from me <\s>
<s> flustered as falder regards him with a queer smile quite without prejudice i meant it kindly <\s>
<s> i'm not allowed to leave the country <\s>
<s> you aren't looking the thing <\s>
<s> i've slept in the park three nights this week <\s>
<s> the dawns aren't all poetry there <\s>
<s> but meeting her i feel a different man this morning <\s>
<s> i've often thought the being fond of hers the best thing about me it's sacred somehow and yet it did for me <\s>
<s> that's queer isn't it <\s>
<s> i'm sure we're all very sorry for you <\s>
<s> that's what i've found mr <\s>
<s> awfully sorry for me <\s>
<s> with quiet bitterness but it doesn't do to associate with criminals <\s>
<s> come come it's no use calling yourself names <\s>
<s> that never did a man any good <\s>
<s> put a face on it <\s>
<s> it's easy enough to put a face on it sir when you're independent <\s>
<s> try it when you're down like me <\s>
<s> they talk about giving you your deserts <\s>
<s> well i think i've had just a bit over <\s>
<s> eyeing him askance over his spectacles i hope they haven't made a socialist of you <\s>
<s> falder is suddenly still as if brooding over his past self he utters a peculiar laugh <\s>
<s> you must give them credit for the best intentions <\s>
<s> nobody wishes you harm i'm sure <\s>
<s> i believe that mr <\s>
<s> nobody wishes you harm but they down you all the same <\s>
<s> this feeling he stares round him as though at something closing in it's crushing me <\s>
<s> with sudden impersonality i know it is <\s>
<s> horribly disturbed there's nothing there <\s>
<s> we must try and take it quiet <\s>
<s> i'm sure i've often had you in my prayers <\s>
<s> now leave it to me <\s>
<s> i'll use my gumption and take em when they're jolly <\s>
<s> as he speaks the two partners come in cokeson rather disconcerted but trying to put them all at ease i didn't expect you quite so soon <\s>
<s> i've just been having a talk with this young man <\s>
<s> i think you'll remember him <\s>
<s> with a grave keen look quite well <\s>
<s> how are you falder <\s>
<s> holding out his hand almost timidly very glad to see you again falder <\s>
<s> who has recovered his self control takes the hand thank you sir <\s>
<s> just a word mr <\s>
<s> to falder pointing to the clerks office you might go in there a minute <\s>
<s> you know your way <\s>
<s> our junior won't be coming this morning <\s>
<s> his wife's just had a little family <\s>
<s> falder goes uncertainly out into the clerks office <\s>
<s> confidentially i'm bound to tell you all about it <\s>
<s> but there's a prejudice against him <\s>
<s> and you're not seeing him to advantage this morning he's under nourished <\s>
<s> it's very trying to go without your dinner <\s>
<s> is that so cokeson <\s>
<s> i wanted to ask you <\s>
<s> he's had his lesson <\s>
<s> now we know all about him and we want a clerk <\s>
<s> there is a young fellow applying but i'm keeping him in the air <\s>
<s> a gaol bird in the office cokeson <\s>
<s> i don't see it <\s>
<s> the rolling of the chariot wheels of justice <\s>
<s> i've never got that out of my head <\s>
<s> i've nothing to reproach myself with in this affair <\s>
<s> what's he been doing since he came out <\s>
<s> he's had one or two places but he hasn't kept them <\s>
<s> seems to fancy everybody's down on him <\s>
<s> don't like the fellow never did from the first <\s>
<s> weak character s written all over him <\s>
<s> i think we owe him a leg up <\s>
<s> he brought it all on himself <\s>
<s> the doctrine of full responsibility doesn't quite hold in these days <\s>
<s> rather grimly you'll find it safer to hold it for all that my boy <\s>
<s> for oneself yes not for other people thanks <\s>
<s> i don't want to be hard <\s>
<s> i'm glad to hear you say that <\s>
<s> he seems to see something spreading his arms round him <\s>
<s> what about that woman he was mixed up with <\s>
<s> i saw some one uncommonly like her outside as we came in <\s>
<s> well i can't keep anything from you <\s>
<s> he has met her <\s>
<s> is she with her husband <\s>
<s> falder living with her i suppose <\s>
<s> desperately trying to retain the new found jollity i don't know that of my own knowledge <\s>
<s> it's our business if we're going to engage him cokeson <\s>
<s> reluctantly i ought to tell you perhaps <\s>
<s> i've had the party here this morning <\s>
<s> to walter no my dear boy it won't do <\s>
<s> the two things together make it very awkward for you i see that <\s>
<s> tentatively i don't quite know what we have to do with his private life <\s>
<s> he must make a clean sheet of it or he can't come here <\s>
<s> will you have him in <\s>
<s> and as james nods i think i can get him to see reason <\s>
<s> grimly you can leave that to me cokeson <\s>
<s> to james in a low voice while cokeson is summoning falder his whole future may depend on what we do dad <\s>
<s> he has pulled himself together and presents a steady front <\s>
<s> now look here falder <\s>
<s> my son and i want to give you another chance but there are two things i must say to you <\s>
<s> in the first place it's no good coming here as a victim <\s>
<s> if you've any notion that you've been unjustly treated get rid of it <\s>
<s> you can't play fast and loose with morality and hope to go scot free <\s>
<s> if society didn't take care of itself nobody would the sooner you realise that the better <\s>
<s> yes sir but may i say something <\s>
<s> i had a lot of time to think it over in prison <\s>
<s> encouraging him i'm sure you did <\s>
<s> there were all sorts there <\s>
<s> and what i mean sir is that if we'd been treated differently the first time and put under somebody that could look after us a bit and not put in prison not a quarter of us would ever have got there <\s>
<s> shaking his head i'm afraid i've very grave doubts of that falder <\s>
<s> with a gleam of malice yes sir so i found <\s>
<s> my good fellow don't forget that you began it <\s>
<s> i never wanted to do wrong <\s>
<s> with all the bitterness of his past suffering it's knocked me out of time <\s>
<s> pulling himself up that is i mean i'm not what i was <\s>
<s> this isn't encouraging for us falder <\s>
<s> he's putting it awkwardly mr <\s>
<s> throwing over his caution from the intensity of his feeling i mean it mr <\s>
<s> now lay aside all those thoughts falder and look to the future <\s>
<s> almost eagerly yes sir but you don't understand what prison is <\s>
<s> it's here it gets you <\s>
<s> he grips his chest <\s>
<s> in a whisper to james i told you he wanted nourishment <\s>
<s> yes but my dear fellow that'll pass away <\s>
<s> with his face twitching i hope so sir <\s>
<s> much more gently now my boy what you've got to do is to put all the past behind you and build yourself up a steady reputation <\s>
<s> and that brings me to the second thing <\s>
<s> this woman you were mixed up with you must give us your word you know to have done with that <\s>
<s> there's no chance of your keeping straight if you're going to begin your future with such a relationship <\s>
<s> looking from one to the other with a hunted expression but sir <\s>
<s> it's the one thing i looked forward to all that time <\s>
<s> i couldn't find her before last night <\s>
<s> during this and what follows cokeson becomes more and more uneasy <\s>
<s> this is painful falder <\s>
<s> but you must see for yourself that it's impossible for a firm like this to close its eyes to everything <\s>
<s> give us this proof of your resolve to keep straight and you can come back not otherwise <\s>
<s> after staring at james suddenly stiffens himself i couldn't give her up <\s>
<s> i'm all she's got to look to <\s>
<s> and i'm sure she's all i've got <\s>
<s> i'm very sorry falder but i must be firm <\s>
<s> it's for the benefit of you both in the long run <\s>
<s> no good can come of this connection <\s>
<s> it was the cause of all your disaster <\s>
<s> but sir it means having gone through all that getting broken up my nerves are in an awful state for nothing <\s>
<s> i did it for her <\s>
<s> if she's anything of a woman she'll see it for herself <\s>
<s> she won't want to drag you down further <\s>
<s> if there were a prospect of your being able to marry her it might be another thing <\s>
<s> it's not my fault sir that she couldn't get rid of him she would have if she could <\s>
<s> that's been the whole trouble from the beginning <\s>
<s> looking suddenly at walter <\s>
<s> if anybody would help her <\s>
<s> it's only money wants now i'm sure <\s>
<s> breaking in as walter hesitates and is about to speak i don't think we need consider that it's rather far fetched <\s>
<s> to walter appealing he must have given her full cause since she could prove that he drove her to leave him <\s>
<s> i'm inclined to do what you say falder if it can be managed <\s>
<s> he goes to the window and looks down into the street <\s>
<s> hurriedly you don't take me mr <\s>
<s> i have my reasons <\s>
<s> from the window she's down there sir <\s>
<s> will you see her <\s>
<s> i can beckon to her from here <\s>
<s> walter hesitates and looks from cokeson to james <\s>
<s> with a sharp nod yes let her come <\s>
<s> falder beckons from the window <\s>
<s> in a low fluster to james and walter no mr <\s>
<s> she's not been quite what she ought to ha been while this young man's been away <\s>
<s> she's lost her chance <\s>
<s> we can't consult how to swindle the law <\s>
<s> falder has come from the window <\s>
<s> the three men look at him in a sort of awed silence <\s>
<s> with instinctive apprehension of some change looking from one to the other there's been nothing between us sir to prevent it <\s>
<s> what i said at the trial was true <\s>
<s> and last night we only just sat in the park <\s>
<s> sweedle comes in from the outer office <\s>
<s> there is silence james <\s>
<s> ruth comes slowly in and stands stoically with falder on one side and the three men on the other <\s>
<s> cokeson turns to his table bending over his papers as though the burden of the situation were forcing him back into his accustomed groove <\s>
<s> sharply shut the door there <\s>
<s> sweedle shuts the door we've asked you to come up because there are certain facts to be faced in this matter <\s>
<s> i understand you have only just met falder again <\s>
<s> he's told us about himself and we're very sorry for him <\s>
<s> i've promised to take him back here if he'll make a fresh start <\s>
<s> looking steadily at ruth this is a matter that requires courage ma'am <\s>
<s> ruth who is looking at falder begins to twist her hands in front of her as though prescient of disaster <\s>
<s> walter how is good enough to say that he'll help us to get you a divorce <\s>
<s> ruth flashes a startled glance at james and walter <\s>
<s> i don't think that's practicable falder <\s>
<s> you're fond of him <\s>
<s> yes sir i love him <\s>
<s> she looks miserably at falder <\s>
<s> then you don't want to stand in his way do you <\s>
<s> in a faint voice i could take care of him <\s>
<s> the best way you can take care of him will be to give him up <\s>
<s> nothing shall make me give you up <\s>
<s> you can get a divorce <\s>
<s> there's been nothing between us has there <\s>
<s> mournfully shaking her head without looking at him no <\s>
<s> we'll keep apart till it's over sir if you'll only help us we promise <\s>
<s> to ruth you see the thing plainly don't you <\s>
<s> you see what i mean <\s>
<s> just above a whisper yes <\s>
<s> to himself there's a dear woman <\s>
<s> the situation is impossible <\s>
<s> forcing himself to look at her i put it to you ma'am <\s>
<s> his future is in your hands <\s>
<s> miserably i want to do the best for him <\s>
<s> a little huskily that's right that's right <\s>
<s> you're not going to give me up after all this <\s>
<s> there's something starting forward to james sir i swear solemnly there's been nothing between us <\s>
<s> i believe you falder <\s>
<s> come my lad be as plucky as she is <\s>
<s> just now you were going to help us <\s>
<s> he starts at ruth who is standing absolutely still his face and hands twitch and quiver as the truth dawns on him what is it <\s>
<s> you've not been walter <\s>
<s> that'll do that'll do <\s>
<s> i'll give you your chance falder <\s>
<s> don't let me know what you do with yourselves that's all <\s>
<s> as if he has not heard ruth <\s>
<s> ruth looks at him and falder covers his face with his hands <\s>
<s> suddenly there's some one out there <\s>
<s> to ruth go in here <\s>
<s> you'll feel better by yourself for a minute <\s>
<s> he points to the clerks room and moves towards the outer office <\s>
<s> falder does not move <\s>
<s> ruth puts out her hand timidly <\s>
<s> he shrinks back from the touch <\s>
<s> she turns and goes miserably into the clerks room <\s>
<s> with a brusque movement he follows seizing her by the shoulder just inside the doorway <\s>
<s> cokeson shuts the door <\s>
<s> pointing to the outer office get rid of that whoever it is <\s>
<s> opening the office door in a scared voice detective sergeant blister <\s>
<s> the detective enters and closes the door behind him <\s>
<s> sorry to disturb you sir <\s>
<s> a clerk you had here two years and a half ago i arrested him in this room <\s>
<s> i thought perhaps i might get his whereabouts from you <\s>
<s> there is an awkward silence cokeson <\s>
<s> pleasantly coming to the rescue we're not responsible for his movements you know that <\s>
<s> what do you want with him <\s>
<s> he's failed to report himself this last four weeks <\s>
<s> ticket of leave won't be up for another six months sir <\s>
<s> has he to keep in touch with the police till then <\s>
<s> we're bound to know where he sleeps every night <\s>
<s> i dare say we shouldn't interfere sir even though he hasn't reported himself <\s>
<s> but we've just heard there's a serious matter of obtaining employment with a forged reference <\s>
<s> what with the two things together we must have him <\s>
<s> again there is silence <\s>
<s> walter and cokeson steal glances at james who stands staring steadily at the detective <\s>
<s> expansively we're very busy at the moment <\s>
<s> if you could make it convenient to call again we might be able to tell you then <\s>
<s> decisively i'm a servant of the law but i dislike peaching <\s>
<s> in fact i can't do such a thing <\s>
<s> if you want him you must find him without us <\s>
<s> as he speaks his eye falls on falder's cap still lying on the table and his face contracts <\s>
<s> noting the gesture quietly very good sir <\s>
<s> i ought to warn you that having broken the terms of his licence he's still a convict and sheltering a convict <\s>
<s> i shelter no one <\s>
<s> but you mustn't come here and ask questions which it's not my business to answer <\s>
<s> dryly i won't trouble you further then gentlemen <\s>
<s> i'm sorry we couldn't give you the information <\s>
<s> you quite understand don't you <\s>
<s> wister turns to go but instead of going to the door of the outer office he goes to the door of the clerks room <\s>
<s> the other door .... <\s>
<s> wister opens the clerks door <\s>
<s> ruths's voice is heard oh do <\s>
<s> and falder's i can't <\s>
<s> there is a little pause then with sharp fright ruth says who's that <\s>
<s> wister has gone in <\s>
<s> the three men look aghast at the door <\s>
<s> wister from within keep back please <\s>
<s> he comes swiftly out with his arm twisted in falder's <\s>
<s> the latter gives a white staring look at the three men <\s>
<s> let him go this time for god's sake <\s>
<s> i couldn't take the responsibility sir <\s>
<s> with a queer desperate laugh good <\s>
<s> flinging a look back at ruth he throws up his head and goes out through the outer office half dragging wister after him <\s>
<s> with despair that finishes him <\s>
<s> it'll go on for ever now <\s>
<s> sweedle can be seen staring through the outer door <\s>
<s> there are sounds of footsteps descending the stone stairs suddenly a dull thud a faint my god <\s>
<s> the door swings to behind him <\s>
<s> there is dead silence <\s>
<s> starting forward to the inner room the woman she's fainting <\s>
<s> he and cokeson support the fainting ruth from the doorway of the clerks room <\s>
<s> distracted here my dear <\s>
<s> have you any brandy <\s>
<s> he places ruth in a chair which james has dragged forward <\s>
<s> it's good strong sherry <\s>
<s> they try to force the sherry between her lips there is the sound of feet and they stop to listen <\s>
<s> the outer door is reopened wister and sweedle are seen carrying some burden <\s>
<s> hurrying forward what is it <\s>
<s> they lay the burden doom in the outer office out of sight and all but ruth cluster round it speaking in hushed voices <\s>
<s> he must have been mad to think he could give me the slip like that <\s>
<s> and what was it just a few months <\s>
<s> bitterly was that all <\s>
<s> what a desperate thing <\s>
<s> then in a voice unlike his own run for a doctor you <\s>
<s> sweedle rushes from the outer office an ambulance <\s>
<s> on ruth's face an expression of fear and horror has been seen growing as if she dared not turn towards the voices <\s>
<s> she now rises and steals towards them <\s>
<s> the three men shrink back out of her way one by one into cokeson's room <\s>
<s> ruth drops on her knees by the body <\s>
<s> in a whisper what is it <\s>
<s> she crouches over him my dear <\s>
<s> in the outer office doorway the figures of men am seen standing <\s>
<s> leaping to her feet no no <\s>

<s> in a hoarse voice there there poor dear woman <\s>
<s> at the sound behind her ruth faces round at him <\s>

<s> of course i'll back you all that's possible but i can't invent things <\s>
<s> you wouldn't let me come to you for a bit till i could find my feet <\s>
<s> fullarton taken aback cannot refrain from her glance at fullarton automatically gazing at clare while he talks with huntingdon <\s>
<s> of course the only thing is that clare <\s>
<s> with a faint smile it's all right dolly <\s>
<s> don't do anything desperate clare you are so desperate sometimes <\s>
<s> you ought to make terms not tracks <\s>
<s> she shakes her head what have i got to make terms with <\s>
<s> what he still wants is just what i hate giving <\s>
<s> no dolly even you don't understand <\s>
<s> all day and every day just as far apart as we can be and still jolly isn't it <\s>

<s> returning look here clare <\s>
<s> this is working up for a mess old girl <\s>

<s> get married and find out after a year that she's the wrong person so wrong that you can't exchange a single real thought that your blood runs cold when she kisses you then you'll know <\s>
<s> my dear old girl i don't want to be a brute but it's a bit difficult to believe in that except in novels <\s>
<s> yes incredible when you haven't tried <\s>
<s> i mean you you chose him yourself <\s>
<s> no one forced you to marry him <\s>
<s> it does seem monstrous doesn't it <\s>
<s> my dear child do give us a reason <\s>
<s> she points out at the night and the darkening towers if george saw that for the first time he'd just say ah westminster <\s>
<s> can you see the time by it <\s>
<s> as if one cared where or what it was beautiful like that <\s>
<s> apply that to every every everything <\s>
<s> staring george may be a bit prosaic <\s>
<s> but my dear old girl if that's all clare <\s>
<s> it's not all it's nothing <\s>
<s> i can't explain reggie it's not reason at all it's it's like being underground in a damp cell it's like knowing you'll never get out <\s>
<s> nothing coming never anything coming again never anything <\s>
<s> moved and puzzled my dear old thing you mustn't get into fantods like this <\s>
<s> if it's like that don't think about it <\s>
<s> when every day and every night oh <\s>
<s> i know it's my fault for having married him but that doesn't help <\s>
<s> it's not as if george wasn't quite a decent chap <\s>
<s> and it's no use blinking things you are absolutely dependent on him <\s>
<s> at home they've got every bit as much as they can do to keep going <\s>
<s> and you've got to think of the girls <\s>
<s> any trouble would be very beastly for them <\s>
<s> and the poor old governor would feel it awfully <\s>
<s> if i didn't know all that reggie i should have gone home long ago <\s>
<s> well what's to be done <\s>
<s> if my pay would run to it but it simply won't <\s>

<s> don't let's talk about it <\s>
<s> well my child there's just one thing you won't go sailing near the wind will you <\s>
<s> i mean there are fellows always on the lookout <\s>
<s> that chap malise you'd better avoid him <\s>
<s> i don't know him <\s>
<s> he may be all right but he's not our sort <\s>
<s> and you're too pretty to go on the tack of the new woman and that kind of thing haven't been brought up to it <\s>
<s> british home made summer goods light and attractive don't wear long <\s>
<s> at the sound of voices in the hall they seem to be going reggie <\s>
<s> huntingdon looks at her vexed unhappy huntingdon <\s>
<s> don't head for trouble old girl <\s>
<s> clare kisses him and when he has gone turns away from the door holding herself in refusing to give rein to some outburst of emotion <\s>
<s> suddenly she sits down at the untouched bridge table leaning her bare elbows on it and her chin on her hands quite calm <\s>
<s> george is coming in <\s>
<s> nothing more wanted thank you paynter <\s>
<s> you can go home and the maids can go to bed <\s>
<s> we are much obliged ma'am <\s>
<s> i ran over a dog and had to get it seen to <\s>
<s> i couldn't get you a little anything ma'am <\s>
<s> you needn't have gone out of your way to tell a lie that wouldn't deceive a guinea pig <\s>
<s> going up to her pleased with yourself to night <\s>
<s> clare shakes her head before that fellow malise as if our own people weren't enough <\s>
<s> is it worth while to rag me <\s>
<s> i know i've behaved badly but i couldn't help it really <\s>
<s> couldn't help behaving like a shop girl <\s>
<s> you were brought up as well as i was <\s>
<s> to let everybody see that we don't get on there's only one word for it disgusting <\s>
<s> then why do you do it <\s>
<s> i've always kept my end up <\s>
<s> why in heaven's name do you behave in this crazy way <\s>
<s> with intense feeling you like making a fool of me <\s>
<s> only i must break out sometimes <\s>
<s> there are things one does not do <\s>
<s> i came in because i was sorry <\s>
<s> and at once began to do it again <\s>
<s> it seems to me you delight in rows <\s>
<s> for god's sake clare drop cynicism <\s>
<s> you are my wife i suppose <\s>
<s> and they twain shall be one spirit <\s>
<s> don't talk wild nonsense <\s>
<s> there is silence clare <\s>
<s> softly i don't give satisfaction <\s>
<s> please give me notice <\s>
<s> five years and four of them like this <\s>
<s> i'm sure we've served our time <\s>
<s> don't you really think we might get on better together if i went away <\s>
<s> i've told you i won't stand a separation for no real reason and have your name bandied about all over london <\s>
<s> i have some primitive sense of honour <\s>
<s> you mean your name don't you <\s>
<s> did that fellow malise put all this into your head <\s>
<s> no my own evil nature <\s>
<s> i wish the deuce we'd never met him <\s>
<s> comes of picking up people you know nothing of <\s>
<s> i distrust him and his looks and his infernal satiric way <\s>
<s> he can't even dress decently <\s>
<s> with a touch of rapture ah h <\s>
<s> why do you let him come <\s>
<s> what d'you find interesting in him <\s>
<s> to have a mind as you call it it's not necessary to talk about art and literature <\s>
<s> then what do you talk about your minds <\s>
<s> clare looks at him will you answer a straight question <\s>
<s> is he falling in love with you <\s>
<s> you had better ask him <\s>
<s> i tell you plainly as a man of the world i don't believe in the guide philosopher and friend business <\s>
<s> clare suddenly clasps her hands behind her head <\s>
<s> you'd be much happier with any other woman <\s>
<s> i believe i'm sure i could earn my living <\s>
<s> it has been done <\s>
<s> it will never be done by you understand that <\s>
<s> it really is time we parted <\s>
<s> i'd go clean out of your life <\s>
<s> i don't want your support unless i'm giving you something for your money <\s>
<s> once for all i don't mean to allow you to make fools of us both <\s>
<s> but if we are already <\s>
<s> we go on and on <\s>
<s> that's not my opinion nor the opinion of anyone so long as you behave yourself <\s>
<s> that is behave as you think right <\s>
<s> clare you're pretty riling <\s>
<s> i don't want to be horrid <\s>
<s> but i am in earnest this time <\s>
<s> clare turns to the curtained door george <\s>
<s> god knows i don't want to be a brute <\s>
<s> i know you're not happy <\s>
<s> and you are you happy <\s>
<s> i don't say i am <\s>
<s> but why can't we be <\s>
<s> i see no reason except that you are you and i am i <\s>
<s> you know we did <\s>
<s> too long ago if ever <\s>
<s> george coming closer i still clare <\s>
<s> making a barrier of her hand you know that's only cupboard love <\s>
<s> we've got to face the facts <\s>
<s> i thought i was <\s>
<s> the facts are that we're married for better or worse and certain things are expected of us <\s>
<s> it's suicide for you and folly for me in my position to ignore that <\s>
<s> you have all you can reasonably want and i don't don't wish for any change <\s>
<s> if you could bring anything against me if i drank or knocked about town or expected too much of you <\s>
<s> i'm not unreasonable in any way that i can see <\s>
<s> well i think we've talked enough <\s>
<s> she again moves towards the curtained door george <\s>
<s> look here clare you don't mean you're expecting me to put up with the position of a man who's neither married nor unmarried <\s>
<s> you ought to know <\s>
<s> i haven't yet have i <\s>
<s> don't go like that <\s>
<s> do you suppose we're the only couple who've found things aren't what they thought and have to put up with each other and make the best of it <\s>
<s> well why do you imagine they do it <\s>
<s> from a common sense of decency <\s>
<s> you can be the most maddening thing in all the world <\s>
<s> taking up a pack of cards he lets them fall with a long slithering flutter after behaving as you have this evening you might try to make some amends i should think <\s>
<s> clare moves her head from side to side as if in sight of something she could not avoid <\s>
<s> he puts his hand on her arm <\s>
<s> dropping his hand can't you make it up <\s>
<s> i don't feel very christian <\s>
<s> she opens the door passes through and closes it behind her <\s>
<s> george steps quickly towards it stops and turns back into the room <\s>
<s> he goes to the window and stands looking out shuts it with a bang and again contemplates the door <\s>
<s> moving forward he rests his hand on the deserted card table clutching its edge and muttering <\s>
<s> then he crosses to the door into the hall and switches off the light <\s>
<s> he opens the door to go out then stands again irresolute in the darkness and heaves a heavy sigh <\s>
<s> suddenly he mutters no <\s>
<s> crosses resolutely back to the curtained door and opens it <\s>
<s> in the gleam of light clare is standing unhooking a necklet <\s>
<s> he goes in shutting the door behind him with a thud <\s>
<s> act ii the scene is a large whitewashed disordered room whose outer door opens on to a corridor and stairway <\s>
<s> doors on either side lead to other rooms <\s>
<s> on the walls are unframed reproductions of fine pictures secured with tintacks <\s>
<s> an old wine coloured armchair of low and comfortable appearance near the centre of the room is surrounded by a litter of manuscripts books ink pens and newspapers as though some one had already been up to his neck in labour though by a grandfather's clock it is only eleven <\s>
<s> on a smallish table close by are sheets of paper cigarette ends and two claret bottles <\s>
<s> there are many books on shelves and on the floor an overflowing pile whereon rests a soft hat and a black knobby stick <\s>
<s> malise sits in his armchair garbed in trousers dressing gown and slippers unshaved and uncollared writing <\s>
<s> he pauses smiles lights a cigarette and tries the rhythm of the last sentence holding up a sheet of quarto ms <\s>
<s> not a word not a whisper of liberty from all those excellent frock coated gentlemen not a sign not a grimace <\s>
<s> only the monumental silence of their profound deference before triumphant tyranny <\s>
<s> while he speaks a substantial woman a little over middle age in old dark clothes and a black straw hat enters from the corridor <\s>
<s> she goes to a cupboard brings out from it an apron and a bissell broom <\s>
<s> her movements are slow and imperturbable as if she had much time before her <\s>
<s> her face is broad and dark with chinese eyebrows <\s>
<s> i'm gettin be'ind'and sir <\s>
<s> she comes and stands before him <\s>
<s> there's a man angin about below <\s>
<s> malise looks up seeing that she has roused his attention she stops <\s>
<s> but as soon as he is about to write again goes on <\s>
<s> i see him first yesterday afternoon <\s>
<s> i'd just been out to get meself a pennyworth o soda an as i come in i passed im on the second floor lookin at me with an air of suspicion <\s>
<s> i thought to meself at the time i thought you're a'andy sort of ang dog man <\s>

<s> isn't he a dun <\s>

<s> if i took me time i could get im innercent like with a jug o water <\s>
<s> malise smiling shakes his head malise <\s>
<s> you can get on now i'm going to shave <\s>
<s> he looks at the clock and passes out into the inner room <\s>
<s> miler gazes round her pins up her skirt sits down in the armchair takes off her hat and puts it on the table and slowly rolls up her sleeves then with her hands on her knees she rests <\s>
<s> there is a soft knock on the door <\s>
<s> she gets up leisurely and moves flat footed towards it <\s>
<s> the door being opened clare is revealed <\s>
<s> won't take im long <\s>
<s> would you say a lady <\s>
<s> it's against the rules <\s>
<s> but if you'll sit down a moment i'll see what i can do <\s>
<s> she brings forward a chair and rubs it with her apron <\s>
<s> then goes to the door of the inner room and speaks through it a lady to see you <\s>
<s> returning she removes some cigarette ends this is my hour <\s>
<s> i shan't make much dust <\s>
<s> noting clare's eyebrows raised at the debris round the armchair i'm particular about not disturbin things <\s>
<s> i'm sure you are <\s>
<s> he likes is abits regular <\s>
<s> making a perfunctory pass with the bissell broom she runs it to the cupboard comes back to the table takes up a bottle and holds it to the light finding it empty she turns it upside down and drops it into the wastepaper basket then holding up the other bottle and finding it not empty she corks it and drops it into the fold of her skirt <\s>
<s> he takes his claret fresh opened not like these ere bawgwars <\s>
<s> rising i think i'll come back later <\s>
<s> malise is not in my confidence <\s>
<s> we keep each other to ourselves <\s>
<s> perhaps you'd like to read the paper he has it fresh every mornin' the westminister <\s>
<s> she plucks that journal from out of the armchair and hands it to clare who sits doom again unhappily to brood <\s>
<s> miler makes a pass or two with a very dirty duster then stands still <\s>
<s> no longer hearing sounds clare looks up <\s>
<s> i wouldn't interrupt yer with my workin but e likes things clean <\s>
<s> at a sound from the inner room that's im e's cut isself <\s>
<s> i'll just take im the tobaccer <\s>
<s> she lifts a green paper screw of tobacco from the debris round the armchair and taps on the door <\s>
<s> clare moves restlessly across the room <\s>
<s> speaking into the room the tobaccer <\s>
<s> clare has stopped before a reproduction of titian's picture sacred and profane love <\s>
<s> miler stands regarding her with a chinese smile <\s>
<s> malise enters a thread of tobacco still hanging to his cheek <\s>
<s> miler's hat off the table and handing it to her do the other room <\s>
<s> enigmatically she goes malise <\s>
<s> jolly of you to come <\s>
<s> can i do anything <\s>
<s> proud to have given you that advice <\s>
<s> the morning after you gave it me <\s>
<s> i went down to my people <\s>
<s> i knew it would hurt my dad frightfully but somehow i thought i could make him see <\s>
<s> he was awfully sweet only he couldn't <\s>
<s> softly we english love liberty in those who don't belong to us <\s>
<s> there were the children and my old nurse <\s>
<s> i could never live at home now <\s>
<s> they'd think i was <\s>
<s> i'd made up my mind to go back to my owner and then he came down himself <\s>
<s> i couldn't d it <\s>
<s> to be hauled back and begin all over again i simply couldn't <\s>
<s> i watched for a chance and ran to the station and came up to an hotel <\s>
<s> i don't know no pluck this morning <\s>
<s> you see i've got to earn my living no money only a few things i can sell <\s>
<s> all yesterday i was walking about looking at the women <\s>
<s> how does anyone ever get a chance <\s>
<s> sooner than you should hurt his dignity by working your husband would pension you off <\s>
<s> if i don't go back to him i couldn't take it <\s>
<s> i've thought of nursing but it's a long training and i do so hate watching pain <\s>
<s> the fact is i'm pretty hopeless can't even do art work <\s>
<s> i came to ask you about the stage <\s>
<s> have you ever acted <\s>
<s> clare shakes her head you mightn't think so but i've heard there's a prejudice in favour of training <\s>
<s> there's chorus i don't recommend it <\s>
<s> how about your brother <\s>
<s> my brother's got nothing to spare and he wants to get married and he's going back to india in september <\s>
<s> the only friend i should care to bother is mrs <\s>
<s> fullarton and she's got a husband <\s>
<s> i remember the gentleman <\s>
<s> besides i should be besieged day and night to go back <\s>
<s> i must lie doggo somehow <\s>
<s> it makes my blood boil to think of women like you <\s>
<s> god help all ladies without money <\s>
<s> i expect i shall have to go back <\s>
<s> we shall find something <\s>
<s> keep your soul alive at all costs <\s>
<s> let him hang on to you till you're nothing but emptiness and ache till you lose even the power to ache <\s>
<s> sit in his drawing room pay calls play bridge go out with him to dinners return to duty and feel less and less and be less and less and so grow old and die <\s>
<s> the bell rings malise <\s>
<s> looking at the door in doubt by the wayhe'd no means of tracing you <\s>
<s> she shakes her head the bell rings again malise <\s>
<s> was there a man on the stairs as you came up <\s>
<s> he's begun to haunt them i'm told <\s>
<s> but that would mean they thought i oh <\s>
<s> confidence in me is not excessive <\s>
<s> will you go in there for a minute <\s>
<s> or shall we let them ring or what <\s>
<s> it may not be anything of course <\s>
<s> i'm not going to hide <\s>
<s> the bell rings a third time malise <\s>
<s> opening the door of the inner room mrs <\s>
<s> miler just see who it is and then go for the present <\s>
<s> miler comes out with her hat on passes enigmatically to the door and opens it <\s>
<s> a man's voice says mr <\s>
<s> would you give him these cards <\s>
<s> sir charles and lady dedmond <\s>
<s> he looks at clare clare <\s>
<s> her face scornful and unmoved let them come <\s>
<s> miler show them in <\s>
<s> twisden enters a clean shaved shrewd looking man with a fighting underlip followed by sir charles and lady dedmond <\s>
<s> there are no greetings <\s>
<s> how do you do mrs <\s>
<s> had the pleasure of meeting you at your wedding <\s>
<s> clare inclines her head i am mr <\s>
<s> george dedmond's solicitor sir <\s>
<s> i wonder if you would be so very kind as to let us have a few words with mrs <\s>
<s> at a nod from clare malise passes into the inner room and shuts the door <\s>
<s> dedmond i must apologize but you you hardly gave us an alternative did you <\s>
<s> he pauses for an answer and not getting one goes on your disappearance has given your husband great anxiety <\s>
<s> really my dear madam you must forgive us for this attempt to get into communication <\s>
<s> why did you spy here <\s>
<s> nobody's spied on you <\s>
<s> i'm afraid the answer is that we appear to have been justified <\s>
<s> at the expression on clare's face he goes on hastily now mrs <\s>
<s> dedmond i'm a lawyer and i know that appearances are misleading <\s>
<s> don't think i'm unfriendly i wish you well <\s>
<s> clare raises her eyes <\s>
<s> moved by that look which is exactly as if she had said i have no friends he hurries on what we want to say to you is this don't let this split go on <\s>
<s> don't commit yourself to what you'll bitterly regret <\s>
<s> just tell us what's the matter <\s>
<s> i'm sure it can be put straight <\s>
<s> i have nothing against my husband it was quite unreasonable to leave him <\s>
<s> unfortunately there's something stronger than reason <\s>
<s> i don't know it mrs <\s>
<s> disconcerted are you you oughtn't to take a step without advice in your position <\s>
<s> approaching her come now isn't there anything you feel you'd like to say that might help to put matters straight <\s>
<s> i don't think so thank you <\s>
<s> you must see clare that twisden <\s>
<s> in your position mrs <\s>
<s> dedmond a beautiful young woman without money <\s>
<s> this is a hard world <\s>
<s> should be awfully sorry if anything goes wrong <\s>
<s> and if i go back <\s>
<s> of two evils if it be so choose the least <\s>
<s> i am twenty six he is thirty two <\s>
<s> we can't reasonably expect to die for fifty years <\s>
<s> what's open to you if you don't go back <\s>
<s> come what's your position <\s>
<s> neither fish flesh nor fowl fair game for everybody <\s>
<s> dedmond for a pretty woman to strike as it appears you're doing simply because the spirit of her marriage has taken flight is madness <\s>
<s> you must know that no one pays attention to anything but facts <\s>
<s> if now excuse me you you had a lover his eyes travel round the room and again rest on her you would at all events have some ground under your feet some sort of protection but he pauses as you have not you've none <\s>
<s> except what i make myself <\s>
<s> there's the bedrock difficulty <\s>
<s> as you haven't money you should never have been pretty <\s>
<s> you're up against the world and you'll get no mercy from it <\s>
<s> we lawyers see too much of that <\s>
<s> i'm putting it brutally as a man of the world <\s>
<s> do you think you quite grasp the alternative <\s>
<s> taken aback but my dear young lady there are two sides to every contract <\s>
<s> after all your husband's fulfilled his <\s>
<s> so have i up till now <\s>
<s> i shan't ask anything from him nothing do you understand <\s>
<s> but my dear you must live <\s>
<s> have you ever done any sort of work <\s>
<s> any conception of the competition nowadays <\s>
<s> twisden looking at her shrugs his shoulders clare <\s>
<s> her composure a little broken by that look it's real to me this you see <\s>
<s> but my dear girl what the devil's to become of george <\s>
<s> he can do what he likes it's nothing to me <\s>
<s> dedmond i say without hesitation you've no notion of what you're faced with brought up to a sheltered life as you've been <\s>
<s> do realize that you stand at the parting of the ways and one leads into the wilderness <\s>
<s> glancing at the door through which malise has gone of course if you want to play at wild asses there are plenty who will help you <\s>
<s> i only want to breathe <\s>
<s> it will be too late soon <\s>
<s> there are lots of wolves about <\s>
<s> again he looks at the door clare <\s>
<s> but not where you think <\s>
<s> you say i need advice <\s>
<s> i came here for it <\s>
<s> with a curiously expressive shrug in that case i don't know that i can usefully stay <\s>
<s> he goes to the outer door clare <\s>
<s> please don't have me followed when i leave here <\s>
<s> george is outside clare <\s>
<s> i don't wish to see him <\s>
<s> by what right have you come here <\s>
<s> she goes to the door through which malise has passed opens it and says please come in mr <\s>
<s> glancing at malise he inclines his head i am sorry <\s>
<s> he goes lady dedmond <\s>
<s> malise i'm sure will see clare <\s>
<s> malise will stay here please in his own room <\s>
<s> malise bows sir charles <\s>
<s> my dear girl pon my soul you know i can't grasp your line of thought at all <\s>
<s> george is most willing to take up things just as they were before you left <\s>
<s> quite frankly what is it you want <\s>
<s> to be left alone <\s>
<s> quite frankly he made a mistake to have me spied on <\s>
<s> but my good girl if you'd let us know where you were like a reasonable being <\s>
<s> you can't possibly be left to yourself without money or position of any kind <\s>
<s> heaven knows what you'd be driven to <\s>
<s> you will be good enough to repeat that out loud sir <\s>
<s> clare you must know this is all a fit of spleen your duty and your interest marriage is sacred clare <\s>
<s> my marriage has become the the reconciliation of two animals one of them unwilling <\s>
<s> that's all the sanctity there is about it <\s>
<s> she looks at malise lady dedmond <\s>
<s> you ought to be horribly ashamed <\s>
<s> of the fact i am <\s>
<s> darting a glance at malise if we are to talk this out it must be in private <\s>
<s> to clare do you wish me to go <\s>
<s> at malise i should have thought ordinary decent feeling good heavens girl <\s>

<s> if you insinuate anything against mr <\s>
<s> if you will do these things come to a man's rooms clare <\s>
<s> i came to mr <\s>
<s> malise because he's the only person i know with imagination enough to see what my position is i came to him a quarter of an hour ago for the first time for definite advice and you instantly suspect him <\s>
<s> frigidly is this the natural place for me to find my son's wife <\s>
<s> will you listen to reginald <\s>
<s> haven't you any religious sense at all clare <\s>
<s> none if it's religion to live as we do <\s>
<s> it's terrible this state of mind <\s>
<s> clare breaks into the soft laugh of the other evening <\s>
<s> as if galvanized by the sound sir charles comes to life out of the transfixed bewilderment with which he has been listening <\s>
<s> for god's sake don't laugh like that <\s>
<s> clare stops lady dedmond <\s>
<s> with real feeling for the sake of the simple right clare <\s>
<s> whatever else is right our life is not <\s>
<s> she puts her hand on her heart i swear before god that i've tried and tried <\s>
<s> i swear before god that if i believed we could ever again love each other only a little tiny bit i'd go back <\s>
<s> i swear before god that i don't want to hurt anybody <\s>
<s> but you are hurting everybody <\s>
<s> losing control can't you see that i'm fighting for all my life to come not to be buried alive not to be slowly smothered <\s>
<s> i'm not wax i'm flesh and blood <\s>
<s> and you want to prison me for ever body and soul <\s>
<s> they stare at her sir charles <\s>
<s> i don't know i don't know <\s>
<s> to malise if you have any decency left sir you will allow my son at all events to speak to his wife alone <\s>
<s> beckoning to her husband we'll wait below <\s>
<s> i i want to speak <\s>
<s> to clare my dear if you feel like this i can only say as a as a gentleman lady dedmond <\s>
<s> i can only say that damme i don't know that i can say anything <\s>
<s> he looks at her very grieved then turns and marches out followed by lady dedmond whose voice is heard without answered by his what <\s>
<s> in the doorway as they pass george is standing he comes in <\s>
<s> going up to clare who has recovered all her self control will you come outside and speak to me <\s>
<s> george glances at malise who is leaning against the wall with folded arms <\s>
<s> in a low voice clare <\s>
<s> you try me pretty high don't you forcing me to come here and speak before this fellow <\s>
<s> most men would think the worst finding you like this <\s>
<s> you need not have come or thought at all <\s>
<s> did you imagine i was going to let you vanish without an effort clare <\s>
<s> for god's sake be just <\s>
<s> i've come here to say certain things <\s>
<s> if you force me to say them before him on your head be it <\s>

<s> i know all those certain things <\s>
<s> you must come back <\s>
<s> it is your duty <\s>

<s> well it's true and you've no answer <\s>
<s> suddenly our life's a lie <\s>
<s> it's stupid it's disgusting <\s>
<s> i'm tired of it <\s>
<s> please leave me alone <\s>
<s> you rather miss the point i'm afraid <\s>
<s> i didn't come here to tell you what you know perfectly well when you're sane <\s>
<s> i came here to say this anyone in her senses could see the game your friend here is playing <\s>
<s> it wouldn't take a baby in <\s>
<s> if you think that a gentleman like that his stare travels round the dishevelled room till it rests on malise champions a pretty woman for nothing you make a fairly bad mistake <\s>
<s> but malise after one convulsive movement of his hands has again become rigid <\s>
<s> i don't pretend to be subtle or that kind of thing but i have ordinary common sense <\s>
<s> i don't attempt to be superior to plain facts clare <\s>
<s> under her breath facts <\s>
<s> for goodness sake drop that hifalutin tone <\s>
<s> it doesn't suit you <\s>
<s> if you like to go abroad with one of your young sisters until the autumn i'll let the flat and go to the club <\s>
<s> put the fire out with a penny hose <\s>
<s> slowly i am not coming back to you george <\s>
<s> the farce is over <\s>
<s> taken aback for a moment by the finality of her tone suddenly fronts malise then there is something between you and this fellow <\s>
<s> dangerously but without moving i beg your pardon <\s>
<s> looking from one to the other at all events i won't i won't see a woman who once clare makes a sudden effacing movement with her hands i won't see her go to certain ruin without lifting a finger <\s>
<s> with intensity i don't know that you deserve anything of me <\s>
<s> but on my honour as a gentleman i came here this morning for your sake to warn you of what you're doing <\s>
<s> he turns suddenly on malise and i tell this precious friend of yours plainly what i think of him and that i'm not going to play into his hands <\s>
<s> malise without stirring from the wall looks at clare and his lips move clare <\s>
<s> shakes her head at him then to george will you go please <\s>
<s> i will go when you do <\s>
<s> a man of the world should know better than that <\s>
<s> i'm not speaking to you sir <\s>

<s> clare shakes her head george <\s>
<s> with fury d'you mean to stay in this pigsty with that rhapsodical swine <\s>
<s> transformed by god if you don't go i'll kill you <\s>
<s> as suddenly calm that remains to be seen <\s>
<s> with most deadly quietness yes i will kill you <\s>
<s> he goes stealthily along the wall takes up from where it lies on the pile of books the great black knobby stick and stealthily approaches george his face quite fiendish <\s>
<s> with a swift movement grasping the stick please <\s>
<s> malise resigns the stick and the two men perfectly still glare at each other <\s>
<s> clare letting the stick fall puts her foot on it <\s>
<s> then slowly she takes off her hat and lays it on the table <\s>
<s> now will you go <\s>
<s> there is silence george <\s>

<s> turning he goes out and slams the door <\s>
<s> clare and malise remain face to face <\s>
<s> her lips have begun to quiver <\s>
<s> she turns away shuddering and sits down on the edge of the armchair covering her eyes with the backs of her hands <\s>
<s> malise picks up the stick and fingers it lovingly <\s>
<s> then putting it down he moves so that he can see her face <\s>
<s> she is sitting quite still staring straight before her <\s>
<s> nothing could be better <\s>
<s> i don't know what to do <\s>
<s> i don't know what to do <\s>

<s> he means to have revenge on you <\s>

<s> then swiftly turning to him <\s>
<s> if i must bring you harm let me pay you back <\s>
<s> i can't bear it otherwise <\s>
<s> make some use of me if you don't mind <\s>

<s> you poor he clasps and kisses her then drawing back looks in her face <\s>
<s> she has not moved her eyes are still closed but she is shivering her lips are tightly pressed together her hands twitching <\s>
<s> very quietly no no <\s>
<s> this is not the house of a gentleman <\s>
<s> letting her head fall and almost in a whisper i'm sorry <\s>
<s> and without i can't can't <\s>
<s> you've had enough of that <\s>
<s> there is a long silence <\s>
<s> without looking at him she takes up her hat and puts it on <\s>
<s> you don't trust me <\s>
<s> but i can't take when i'm not giving <\s>
<s> i beg i beg you <\s>
<s> what does it matter <\s>
<s> malise i know what i ought to be to you if i let you in for all this <\s>

<s> i give you my solemn word clare <\s>
<s> if i can't be that to you it's not real <\s>
<s> it isn't to be manufactured is it <\s>
<s> to make use of you in such a way <\s>
<s> she moves towards the door malise <\s>
<s> where are you going <\s>
<s> clare does not answer <\s>
<s> she is breathing rapidly <\s>
<s> there is a change in her a sort of excitement beneath her calmness <\s>
<s> not back to him <\s>
<s> clare shakes her head thank god <\s>
<s> to your people again <\s>
<s> but you poor dainty thing <\s>
<s> seizing her arm d'you imagine they'll let you off out there you with your face <\s>
<s> come trust me trust me <\s>
<s> holding out her hand good bye <\s>
<s> not taking that hand this great damned world and you <\s>
<s> the sound of the traffic far down below is audible in the stillness into that <\s>
<s> the men who work with you the men you make friends of d'you think they'll let you be <\s>
<s> the men in the streets staring at you stopping you pudgy bull necked brutes devils with hard eyes senile swine and the chivalrous men like me who don't mean you harm but can't help seeing you're made for love <\s>
<s> or suppose you don't take covert but struggle on in the open <\s>

<s> shaking her head and smiling i'm going to seek my fortune <\s>
<s> i can't let you go <\s>
<s> he looks into her face then realizing that she means it suddenly bends down to her fingers and puts his lips to them <\s>
<s> he releases her hand <\s>
<s> just touching his bent head with her other hand clare turns and goes <\s>
<s> malise remains with bowed head listening to the sound of her receding footsteps <\s>
<s> he raises himself and strikes out into the air with his clenched fist <\s>
<s> act iii malise's sitting room <\s>
<s> an afternoon three months later <\s>
<s> on the table are an open bottle of claret his hat and some tea things <\s>
<s> down in the hearth is a kettle on a lighted spirit stand <\s>
<s> near the door stands haywood a short round faced man with a tobacco coloured moustache malise by the table is contemplating a piece of blue paper <\s>
<s> sorry to press an old customer sir but a year and an alf without any return on your money malise <\s>
<s> your tobacco is too good mr <\s>
<s> i wish i could see my way to smoking another <\s>
<s> well sir that's a funny remedy <\s>
<s> with a knock on the half opened door a boy appears <\s>
<s> your copy for the watchfire please sir <\s>
<s> motioning him out yes <\s>
<s> malise goes up to the pile of books turns them over and takes up some volumes <\s>
<s> this is a very fine unexpurgated translation of boccaccio's decameron mr <\s>
<s> i should say you would get more than the amount of your bill for them <\s>
<s> shaking his head them books worth three pound seven <\s>
<s> it's scarce and highly improper <\s>
<s> will you take them in discharge <\s>
<s> torn between emotions well i ardly know what to say no sir i don't think i'd like to ave to do with that <\s>
<s> you could read them first you know <\s>
<s> dubiously i've got my wife at ome <\s>
<s> you could both read them <\s>
<s> brought to his bearings no sir i couldn't <\s>
<s> very well i'll sell them myself and you shall have the result <\s>
<s> well thank you sir <\s>
<s> i'm sure i didn't want to trouble you <\s>
<s> not at all mr <\s>
<s> it's for me to apologize <\s>
<s> so long as i give satisfaction <\s>
<s> holding the door for him certainly <\s>
<s> good evenin sir no offence i hope <\s>
<s> and malise stands scratching his head then slipping the bill into one of the volumes to remind him he replaces them at the top of the pile <\s>
<s> the boy again advances into the doorway <\s>
<s> yes now for you <\s>
<s> he goes to the table and takes some sheets of ms <\s>
<s> from an old portfolio <\s>
<s> but the door is again timidly pushed open and haywood reappears <\s>
<s> about that little matter sir <\s>
<s> if if it's any convenience to you i've thought of a place where i could malise <\s>
<s> you'll enjoy them thoroughly <\s>
<s> where i can dispose of them <\s>
<s> holding out the volumes it might be as well <\s>
<s> haywood takes the books gingerly i congratulate you mr <\s>
<s> haywood it's a classic <\s>
<s> in the event of there being any malise <\s>
<s> carry it to my credit <\s>
<s> your bill he hands over the blue paper send me the receipt <\s>
<s> haywood nonplussed and trying to hide the books in an evening paper fumbles out <\s>
<s> malise again takes up the sheets of ms <\s>
<s> and cons a sentence over to himself gazing blankly at the stolid boy <\s>
<s> man of the world good form your god <\s>
<s> poor buttoned up philosopher the boy shifts his feet inbred to the point of cretinism and founded to the bone on fear of ridicule the boy breathes heavily you are the slave of facts <\s>
<s> there is a knock on the door malise <\s>
<s> the door is pushed open and reginald huntingdon stands there <\s>
<s> i apologize sir can i come in a minute <\s>
<s> malise bows with ironical hostility huntingdon <\s>
<s> i don't know if you remember me clare dedmond's brother <\s>
<s> he motions to the stolid boy to go outside again huntingdon <\s>
<s> i've come to you sir as a gentleman malise <\s>
<s> there is one i believe on the first floor <\s>
<s> it's about my sister <\s>
<s> don't you know that i've been shadowed these last three months <\s>
<s> ask your detectives for any information you want <\s>
<s> we know that you haven't seen her or even known where she is <\s>
<s> you've found that out <\s>
<s> we know it from my sister <\s>
<s> so you've tracked her down <\s>
<s> fullarton came across her yesterday in one of those big shops selling gloves <\s>
<s> fullarton the lady with the husband <\s>
<s> clap her back into prison <\s>
<s> we have not got her <\s>
<s> she left at once and we don't know where she's gone <\s>
<s> taking hold of his bit look here mr <\s>
<s> malise in a way i share your feeling but i'm fond of my sister and it's damnable to have to go back to india knowing she must be all adrift without protection going through god knows what <\s>
<s> fullarton says she's looking awfully pale and down <\s>
<s> struggling between resentment and sympathy why do you come to me <\s>
<s> my my father and myself <\s>
<s> we thought there was just a chance that having lost that job she might come to you again for advice <\s>
<s> if she does it would be really generous of you if you'd put my father in touch with her <\s>
<s> he's getting old and he feels this very much <\s>
<s> he hands malise a card this is his address <\s>
<s> twisting the card let there be no mistake sir i do nothing that will help give her back to her husband <\s>
<s> she's out to save her soul alive and i don't join the hue and cry that's after her <\s>
<s> on the contrary if i had the power <\s>
<s> if your father wants to shelter her that's another matter <\s>
<s> but she'd her own ideas about that <\s>
<s> perhaps you don't realize how unfit my sister is for rough and tumble <\s>
<s> she's not one of this new sort of woman <\s>
<s> she's always been looked after and had things done for her <\s>
<s> pluck she's got but that's all and she's bound to come to grief <\s>
<s> very likely the first birds do <\s>
<s> but if she drops half way it's better than if she'd never flown <\s>
<s> your sister sir is trying the wings of her spirit out of the old slave market <\s>
<s> for women as for men there's more than one kind of dishonour captain huntingdon and worse things than being dead as you may know in your profession <\s>
<s> we each have our own views as to what they are <\s>
<s> but they all come to death of our spirits for the sake of our carcases <\s>
<s> if you do see my sister i trust you to give her my love and say i begged she would see my father <\s>
<s> if i have the chance yes <\s>
<s> he makes a gesture of salute to which huntingdon responds <\s>
<s> then the latter turns and goes out <\s>
<s> where are you running now <\s>
<s> he stands at the window through which the evening sunlight is powdering the room with smoky gold <\s>
<s> the stolid boy has again come in <\s>
<s> malise stares at him then goes back to the table takes up the ms and booms it at him he receives the charge breathing hard <\s>
<s> man of the world product of a material age incapable of perceiving reality in motions of the spirit having no use as you would say for sentimental nonsense accustomed to believe yourself the national spine your position is unassailable <\s>
<s> you will remain the idol of the country arbiter of law parson in mufti darling of the playwright and the novelist god bless you while waters lap these shores <\s>
<s> he places the sheets of ms <\s>
<s> in an envelope and hands them to the boy <\s>
<s> you're going straight back to the watchfire <\s>
<s> staring at him you're a masterpiece <\s>
<s> he lifts the portfolio from the table and takes it into the inner room <\s>
<s> the boy putting his thumb stolidly to his nose turns to go <\s>
<s> in the doorway he shies violently at the figure of clare standing there in a dark coloured dress skids past her and goes <\s>
<s> clare comes into the gleam of sunlight her white face alive with emotion or excitement <\s>
<s> she looks round her smiles sighs goes swiftly to the door closes it and comes back to the table <\s>
<s> there she stands fingering the papers on the table smoothing malise's hat wistfully eagerly waiting <\s>
<s> with a faint smile not very glorious is it <\s>
<s> he goes towards her and checks himself then slews the armchair round <\s>
<s> sit down sit down <\s>
<s> clare heaving a long sigh sinks down into the chair tea's nearly ready <\s>
<s> he places a cushion for her and prepares tea she looks up at him softly but as he finishes and turns to her she drops that glance <\s>
<s> do you think me an awful coward for coming <\s>
<s> she has taken a little plain cigarette case from her dress would you mind if i smoked <\s>
<s> malise shakes his head then draws back from her again as if afraid to be too close <\s>
<s> and again unseen she looks at him <\s>
<s> so you've lost your job <\s>
<s> you only just missed him <\s>
<s> clare starts up they had an idea you'd come <\s>
<s> he's sailing to morrow he wants you to see your father <\s>
<s> i've written to him every week <\s>
<s> excited they're still hunting me <\s>
<s> touching her shoulder gently it's all right all right <\s>
<s> she sinks again into the chair and again he withdraws <\s>
<s> and once more she gives him that soft eager look and once more averts it as he turns to her <\s>
<s> my nerves have gone funny lately <\s>
<s> it's being always on one's guard and stuffy air and feeling people look and talk about you and dislike your being there <\s>
<s> yes that wants pluck <\s>
<s> shaking her head i curl up all the time <\s>
<s> the only thing i know for certain is that i shall never go back to him <\s>
<s> the more i've hated what i've been doing the more sure i've been <\s>
<s> i might come to anything but not that <\s>
<s> had a very bad time <\s>
<s> it's a curse to be a lady when you have to earn your living <\s>
<s> it's not really been so hard i suppose i've been selling things and living about twice as well as most shop girls <\s>
<s> were they decent to you <\s>
<s> lots of the girls are really nice <\s>
<s> but somehow they don't want me can't help thinking i've got airs or something and in here she touches her breast i don't want them <\s>
<s> fullarton and i used to belong to a society for helping reduced gentlewomen to get work <\s>
<s> i know now what they want enough money not to work that's all <\s>
<s> suddenly looking up at him don't think me worse than i am please <\s>
<s> it's working under people it's having to do it being driven <\s>
<s> i have tried i've not been altogether a coward really <\s>
<s> but every morning getting there the same time every day the same stale dinner as they call it every evening the same good evening miss clare good evening miss simpson good evening miss hart good evening miss clare <\s>
<s> and the same walk home or the same bus and the same men that you mustn't look at for fear they'll follow you <\s>
<s> and the feeling always always that there's no sun or life or hope or anything <\s>
<s> it was just like being ill the way i've wanted to ride and dance and get out into the country <\s>
<s> her excitement dies away into the old clipped composure and she sits down again don't think too badly of me it really is pretty ghastly <\s>
<s> i didn't want to tell more lies than i could help a married woman on strike can't tell the truth you know <\s>
<s> and i can't typewrite or do shorthand yet <\s>
<s> and chorus i thought you wouldn't like <\s>
<s> he checks himself have men been brutes <\s>
<s> stealing a look at him one followed me a lot <\s>
<s> he caught hold of my arm one evening <\s>
<s> i just took this out she draws out her hatpin and holds it like a dagger her lip drawn back as the lips of a dog going to bite and said will you leave me alone please <\s>
<s> it was rather nice <\s>
<s> and there was one quite decent little man in the shop i was sorry for him such a humble little man <\s>
<s> poor devil it's hard not to wish for the moon <\s>
<s> at the tone of his voice clare looks up at him his face is turned away <\s>
<s> softly how have you been <\s>
<s> as hard as god will let me <\s>
<s> stealing another look have you any typewriting i could do <\s>
<s> i could learn and i've still got a brooch i could sell <\s>
<s> which is the best kind <\s>
<s> i had a catalogue of them somewhere <\s>
<s> he goes into the inner room <\s>
<s> the moment he is gone clare stands up her hands pressed to her cheeks as if she felt them flaming <\s>
<s> then with hands clasped she stands waiting <\s>
<s> he comes back with the old portfolio <\s>
<s> can you typewrite where you are <\s>
<s> i have to find a new room anyway <\s>
<s> i'm changing to be safe <\s>
<s> she takes a luggage ticket from her glove i took my things to charing cross only a bag and one trunk <\s>
<s> then with that queer expression on her face which prefaces her desperations you don't want me now i suppose <\s>
<s> hardly above a whisper because if you still wanted me i do now <\s>
<s> etext editors note in the 1924 revision 11 years after this 1913 edition i do now is changed to i could now a significant change in meaning <\s>
<s> staring hard into her face that is quivering and smiling you mean it <\s>
<s> i've thought of you so much <\s>
<s> but only if you're sure <\s>
<s> he clasps her and kisses her closed eyes and so they stand for a moment till the sound of a latchkey in the door sends them apart <\s>
<s> give me that ticket i'll send for your things <\s>
<s> obediently she gives him the ticket smiles and goes quietly into the inner room <\s>
<s> miler has entered her face more chinese than ever shows no sign of having seen <\s>
<s> that lady will stay here mrs <\s>
<s> kindly go with this ticket to the cloak room at charing cross station and bring back her luggage in a cab <\s>
<s> she takes the ticket then impassively in case you don't know there's two o them men about the stairs now <\s>
<s> the moment she is gone malise makes a gesture of maniacal fury <\s>
<s> he steals on tiptoe to the outer door and listens <\s>
<s> then placing his hand on the knob he turns it without noise and wrenches back the door <\s>
<s> transfigured in the last sunlight streaming down the corridor are two men close together listening and consulting secretly <\s>
<s> with strange almost noiseless ferocity you've run her to earth your job's done <\s>
<s> and in their faces he slams the door curtain <\s>
<s> scene ii scene ii the same early on a winter afternoon three months later <\s>
<s> the room has now a certain daintiness <\s>
<s> there are curtains over the doors a couch under the window all the books are arranged on shelves <\s>
<s> in small vases over the fireplace are a few violets and chrysanthemums <\s>
<s> malise sits huddled in his armchair drawn close to the fore paper on knee pen in hand <\s>
<s> he looks rather grey and drawn and round his chair is the usual litter <\s>
<s> at the table now nearer to the window clare sits working a typewriter <\s>
<s> she finishes a line puts sheets of paper together makes a note on a card adds some figures and marks the total <\s>

<s> you're not worrying for me <\s>
<s> except for my poor old dad i don't care a bit <\s>
<s> malise heaves himself out of the chair and begins pacing up and down <\s>
<s> kenneth do you understand why he doesn't claim damages after what he said that day here <\s>
<s> looking suddenly at him it is true that he doesn't <\s>
<s> but you told me yourself malise <\s>
<s> shrugging no use lying any longer you'd know it tomorrow <\s>

<s> clare stands looking at him in distress then goes quickly into the room behind her <\s>

<s> please tell me quickly what you've come for <\s>
<s> bowing slightly i am instructed by mr <\s>
<s> dedmond to say that if you will leave your present companion and undertake not to see him again he will withdraw the suit and settle three hundred a year on you <\s>
<s> at clare's movement of abhorrence don't misunderstand me please it is not it could hardly be a request that you should go back <\s>
<s> dedmond is not prepared to receive you again <\s>
<s> the proposal forgive my saying so remarkably quixotic is made to save the scandal to his family and your own <\s>
<s> it binds you to nothing but the abandonment of your present companion with certain conditions of the same nature as to the future <\s>
<s> in other words it assures you a position so long as you live quietly by yourself <\s>
<s> will you please thank mr <\s>

<s> to twisden she doesn't mean it please be patient <\s>
<s> i do mean it <\s>

<s> in a low voice to twisden please leave me alone with her don't say anything to mr <\s>
<s> dedmond i told you once that i wished you well <\s>

<s> for god's sake think before it's too late <\s>
<s> putting out her hand blindly i'm sorry i called you a coward <\s>
<s> it's the whole thing i meant <\s>
<s> with the curious little movement of one who sees something he does not like to see he goes <\s>
<s> clare is leaning her forehead against the mantel shelf seemingly unconscious that she is not alone <\s>
<s> fullarton approaches quietly till she can see clare's face <\s>
<s> my dear sweet thing don't be cross with met clare turns from her <\s>

<s> do you know clare i think it's awful about you <\s>
<s> you're too fine and not fine enough to put up with things you're too sensitive to take help and you're not strong enough to do without it <\s>
<s> at any rate you might go home to your people <\s>
<s> if i could be the falling bee and kiss thee all the day <\s>
<s> fullarton turns from her ashamed and baffled but her quick eyes take in the room trying to seize on some new point of attack <\s>
<s> you can't be you aren't happy here <\s>
<s> save yourself and all of us <\s>
<s> very still you see i love him <\s>
<s> you used to say you'd never love did not want it would never want it <\s>

<s> she turns at the door and says mournfully good bye my child <\s>
<s> if you can then goes <\s>
<s> clare almost in a whisper repeats the words love <\s>
<s> at the sound of a latchkey she runs as if to escape into the bedroom but changes her mind and stands blotted against the curtain of the door <\s>
<s> for a moment he does not see her standing there against the curtain that is much the same colour as her dress <\s>
<s> his face is that of a man in the grip of a rage that he feels to be impotent <\s>
<s> then seeing her he pulls himself together walks to his armchair and sits down there in his hat and coat <\s>
<s> you may as well tell me <\s>
<s> nothing to tell you child <\s>
<s> at that touch of tenderness she goes up to his chair and kneels down beside it <\s>

<s> malise stares at her i know about it never mind how <\s>
<s> very low there are other things to be got aren't there <\s>

<s> he goes into the bedroom <\s>
<s> clare gets up and stands by the fire looking round in a dazed way <\s>

<s> he stares at them shrugs his shoulders and passes on <\s>
<s> for just a moment clare sits motionless <\s>

<s> curtain act iv supper time in a small room at the gascony on derby day <\s>

<s> a doorway that has no door leads to another small room <\s>
<s> one little table behind a screen and one little table in the open are set for two persons each <\s>
<s> on a service table above which hangs a speaking tube are some dishes of hors d'ouvres a basket of peaches two bottles of champagne in ice pails and a small barrel of oysters in a gilded tub <\s>
<s> arnaud the waiter slim dark quick his face seamed with a quiet soft irony is opening oysters and listening to the robust joy of a distant supper party where a man is playing the last bars of do ye ken john peel on a horn <\s>

<s> and opens another oyster <\s>
<s> two ladies with bare shoulders and large hats pass down the corridor <\s>

<s> the manager a gentleman with neat moustaches and buttoned into a frock coat has appeared brisk noiseless his eyes everywhere he inspects the peaches <\s>
<s> four shillin apiece to night see <\s>
<s> from the inner room a young man and his partner have come in <\s>
<s> she is dark almost spanish looking he fair languid pale clean shaved slackly smiling with half closed eyes one of those who are bred and dissipated to the point of having lost all save the capacity for hiding their emotions <\s>
<s> he speaks in a languid voice <\s>
<s> awful row they're kickin up in there mr <\s>
<s> a fellow with a horn <\s>
<s> blandly gaddesdon hunt my lord always have their supper with us derby night <\s>

<s> seeing them safely landed the manager brisk and noiseless moves away <\s>
<s> in the corridor a lady in black with a cloak falling open seems uncertain whether to come in <\s>
<s> she advances into the doorway <\s>
<s> pointing to the other table as he flies with dishes nice table madame <\s>
<s> clare moves to the corner of it <\s>
<s> an artist in observation of his clients arnaud takes in her face very pale under her wavy simply dressed hair shadowy beneath the eyes not powdered her lips not reddened without a single ornament takes in her black dress finely cut her arms and neck beautifully white and at her breast three gardenias <\s>
<s> and as he nears her she lifts her eyes <\s>
<s> it is very much the look of something lost appealing for guidance <\s>
<s> madame is waiting for some one <\s>
<s> she shakes her head then madame will be veree well here veree well <\s>
<s> i take madame's cloak <\s>
<s> he takes the cloak gently and lays it on the back of the chair fronting the room that she may put it round her when she wishes <\s>
<s> from the corner waiter <\s>
<s> clare sits tracing a pattern with her finger on the cloth her eyes lowered <\s>
<s> once she raises them and follows arnaud's dark rapid figure <\s>

<s> again giving him that look must i order <\s>
<s> non madame it is not necessary <\s>
<s> a glass of water <\s>
<s> he pours it out i have not the pleasure of knowing madame's face <\s>

<s> he goes the bare necked ladies with large hats again pass down the corridor outside and again their voices are wafted in tottie <\s>
<s> my goodness she has got a pride on her <\s>
<s> bobbie'll never stick it <\s>
<s> look here dear galvanized by those sounds clare has caught her cloak and half risen they die away and she subsides <\s>
<s> back at her table with a quaint shrug towards the corridor it is not rowdy here madame as a rule not as in some places <\s>
<s> to night a little noise <\s>
<s> madame is fond of flowers <\s>
<s> he whisks out and returns almost at once with a bowl of carnations from some table in the next room these smell good <\s>
<s> you are very kind <\s>
<s> with courtesy not at all madame a pleasure <\s>
<s> he bows a young man tall thin hard straight with close cropped sandyish hair and moustache a face tanned very red and one of those small long lean heads that only grow in britain clad in a thin dark overcoat thrown open an opera hat pushed back a white waistcoat round his lean middle he comes in from the corridor <\s>
<s> he looks round glances at clare passes her table towards the further room stops in the doorway and looks back at her <\s>
<s> her eyes have just been lifted and are at once cast down again <\s>
<s> the young man wavers catches arnaud's eye jerks his head to summon him and passes into the further room <\s>
<s> arnaud takes up the vase that has been superseded and follows him out <\s>
<s> and clare sits alone in silence broken by the murmurs of the languid lord and his partner behind the screen <\s>
<s> she is breathing as if she had been running hard <\s>
<s> she lifts her eyes <\s>
<s> the tall young man divested of hat and coat is standing by her table holding out his hand with a sort of bashful hardiness <\s>
<s> didn't recognize you at first <\s>
<s> so sorry awfully rude of me <\s>
<s> clare's eyes seem to fly from him to appeal to him to resign herself all at once <\s>

<s> with a smile the derby <\s>

<s> again something moves in the young man and he stammers i mean not clare <\s>
<s> respectfully of course if i if you were waiting for anybody or anything i he half rises clare <\s>
<s> it's all right thank you <\s>
<s> the young man sits down again uncomfortable nonplussed <\s>
<s> there is silence broken by the inaudible words of the languid lord and the distant merriment of the supper party <\s>
<s> arnaud brings the plovers eggs <\s>
<s> abruptly don't you ever go racing then <\s>
<s> arnaud pours out champagne young man <\s>
<s> i remember awfully well my first day <\s>
<s> it was pretty thick lost every blessed bob and my watch and chain playin three cards on the way home <\s>

<s> the young man stares at her young man <\s>
<s> floundering in these waters deeper than he had bargained for i say about things having beginnings did you mean anything <\s>

<s> abruptly it's all right <\s>
<s> he drains his glass then sits bolt upright <\s>
<s> chivalry and the camaraderie of class have begun to stir in him <\s>
<s> of course i can see that you're not i mean that you're a a lady <\s>
<s> clare smiles and i say you know if you have to because you're in a hole i should feel a cad <\s>
<s> let me lend you <\s>
<s> holding up her glass le vin est tire il faut le boire <\s>
<s> the french words which he does not too well understand completing his conviction that she is a lady he remains quite silent frowning <\s>
<s> as clare held up her glass two gentlemen have entered <\s>
<s> the first is blond of good height and a comely insolence <\s>
<s> his crisp fair hair and fair brushed up moustache are just going grey an eyeglass is fixed in one of two eyes that lord it over every woman they see his face is broad and coloured with air and wine <\s>
<s> his companion is a tall thin dark bird of the night with sly roving eyes and hollow cheeks <\s>
<s> they stand looking round then pass into the further room but in passing they have stared unreservedly at clare <\s>
<s> seeing her wince look here <\s>
<s> i'm afraid you must feel me rather a brute you know <\s>
<s> no i don't really <\s>
<s> are you absolute stoney <\s>
<s> clare nods but looking at her frock and cloak you're so awfully well clare <\s>
<s> i had the sense to keep them <\s>
<s> more and more disturbed i say you know i wish you'd let me lend you something <\s>
<s> i had quite a good day down there <\s>
<s> again tracing her pattern on the cloth then looking up at him full i can't take for nothing <\s>
<s> i don't know really i don't this makes me feel pretty rotten <\s>
<s> i mean it's your being a lady <\s>
<s> smiling that's not your fault is it <\s>
<s> you see i've been beaten all along the line <\s>
<s> and i really don't care what happens to me <\s>
<s> she has that peculiar fey look on her face now i really don't except that i don't take charity <\s>
<s> it's lucky for me it's you and not some the supper party is getting still more boisterous and there comes a long view holloa and a blast of the horn <\s>
<s> but i say what about your people <\s>
<s> you must have people of some sort <\s>
<s> he is fast becoming fascinated for her cheeks have begun to flush and her eyes to shine <\s>
<s> oh yes i've had people and a husband and everything and here i am <\s>
<s> she touches her glass this is going to my head <\s>
<s> i sha'n't sing songs and get up and dance and i won't cry i promise you <\s>
<s> between fascination and chivalry by george <\s>
<s> one simply can't believe in this happening to a lady <\s>
<s> have you got sisters <\s>
<s> breaking into her soft laughter my brother's in india <\s>
<s> i sha'n't meet him anyway <\s>
<s> no but i say are you really quite cut off from everybody <\s>
<s> clare nods something rather awful must have happened <\s>
<s> the two gentlemen have returned <\s>
<s> the blond one is again staring fixedly at clare <\s>
<s> this time she looks back at him flaming and with a little laugh he passes with his friend into the corridor <\s>
<s> who are those two <\s>

<s> i'm just back from india myself <\s>
<s> you said your brother was there what's his regiment <\s>
<s> shaking her head you're not going to find out my name <\s>
<s> i haven't got one nothing <\s>
<s> she leans her bare elbows on the table and her face on her hands <\s>
<s> this day last year i broke covert i've been running ever since <\s>
<s> i don't understand a bit <\s>
<s> you must have had a a some one but there is such a change in her face such rigidity of her whole body that he stops and averts his eyes <\s>
<s> when he looks again she is drinking <\s>
<s> she puts the glass down and gives a little laugh <\s>
<s> with a sort of awe anyway it must have been like riding at a pretty stiff fence for you to come here to night <\s>
<s> what's the other side <\s>
<s> the young man puts out his hand and touches her arm <\s>
<s> it is meant for sympathy but she takes it for attraction <\s>
<s> shaking her head not yet please <\s>
<s> may i have a cigarette <\s>
<s> he takes out his case and gives her one clare <\s>
<s> letting the smoke slowly forth yes i'm enjoying it <\s>
<s> had a pretty poor time lately not enough to eat sometimes <\s>
<s> i say do have something more substantial <\s>
<s> clare gives a sudden gasp as if going off into hysterical laughter but she stifles it and shakes her head <\s>
<s> arnaud brings peaches to the table clare <\s>
<s> he fills their glasses and retreats clare <\s>
<s> raising her glass eat and drink for tomorrow we listen <\s>
<s> from the supper party comes the sound of an abortive chorus with a hey ho chivy hark forrard hark forrard tantivy <\s>
<s> jarring out into a discordant whoop it sinks <\s>
<s> this day a stag must die <\s>
<s> suddenly i say i admire your pluck <\s>
<s> shaking her head haven't kept my end up <\s>
<s> lots of women do <\s>
<s> you see i'm too fine and not fine enough <\s>
<s> my best friend said that <\s>
<s> too fine and not fine enough <\s>
<s> she laughs i couldn't be a saint and martyr and i wouldn't be a soulless doll <\s>
<s> neither one thing nor the other that's the tragedy <\s>
<s> you must have had awful luck <\s>
<s> fiercely but what's the good when there's nothing before you do i look ill <\s>
<s> no simply awfully pretty <\s>
<s> with a laugh a man once said to me as you haven't money you should never have been pretty <\s>
<s> but you see it is some good <\s>
<s> if i hadn't been i couldn't have risked coming here could i <\s>
<s> don't you think it was rather sporting of me to buy these she touches the gardenias with the last shilling over from my cab fare <\s>
<s> it's no use doing things by halves is it <\s>
<s> i'm in for it wish me luck <\s>
<s> she drinks and puts her glass down with a smile in for it deep <\s>

<s> at that regard so clear the blond one does not wince <\s>

<s> so good of you <\s>

<s> they turn to greet the two in their nook behind the screen <\s>
<s> clare has not moved nor changed the direction of her gaze <\s>
<s> suddenly she thrusts her hand into the pocket of the cloak that hangs behind her and brings out the little blue bottle which six months ago she took from malise <\s>

<s> that's all i know about her <\s>

<s> from the last note of all the sound flies up to an octave higher sweet and thin like a spirit passing till it is drowned once more in laughter <\s>

<s> on a model's platform stands an easel and canvas <\s>

<s> through a huge uncurtained window close to the street door the snowy lamplit street can be seen and beyond it the river and a night of stars <\s>

<s> her movements are quick and substantial <\s>
<s> her face full of no nonsense is decided and sincere with deep set eyes and a capable well shaped forehead <\s>
<s> shredding of her gloves she warms her hands <\s>
<s> in the doorway appear the figures of two men <\s>
<s> the first is rather short and slight with a soft short beard bright soft eyes and a crumply face <\s>
<s> under his squash hat his hair is rather plentiful and rather grey <\s>
<s> he wears an old brown ulster and woollen gloves and is puffing at a hand made cigarette <\s>
<s> he is ann's father wellwyn the artist <\s>
<s> his companion is a well wrapped clergyman of medium height and stoutish build with a pleasant rosy face rather shining eyes and rather chubby clean shaped lips in appearance indeed a grown up boy <\s>
<s> he is the vicar of the parish canon bertley <\s>
<s> my dear wellwyn the whole question of reform is full of difficulty <\s>
<s> when you have two men like professor calway and sir thomas hoxton taking diametrically opposite points of view as we've seen to night i confess i wellwyn <\s>
<s> come in vicar and have some grog <\s>
<s> great temptation though this room <\s>
<s> goodnight wellwyn good night ann <\s>
<s> coming from the fire towards the tea table good night canon bertley <\s>
<s> he goes out and wellwyn shutting the door after him approaches the fire ann <\s>
<s> sitting on the little stool with her back to the fire and making tea daddy <\s>
<s> you say you liked professor calway's lecture <\s>
<s> is it going to do you any good that's the question <\s>
<s> i i hope so ann <\s>
<s> i took you on purpose <\s>
<s> your charity's getting simply awful <\s>
<s> those two this morning cleared out all my housekeeping money <\s>
<s> i quite understand your feeling <\s>
<s> they both had your card so i couldn't refuse didn't know what you'd said to them <\s>
<s> why don't you make it a rule never to give your card to anyone except really decent people and picture dealers of course <\s>
<s> my dear i have often <\s>
<s> then why don't you keep it <\s>
<s> it's a frightful habit <\s>
<s> you are naughty daddy <\s>
<s> one of these days you'll get yourself into most fearful complications <\s>
<s> my dear when they when they look at you <\s>
<s> you know the house wants all sorts of things <\s>
<s> why do you speak to them at all <\s>
<s> i don't they speak to me <\s>
<s> he takes of his ulster and hangs it over the back of an arm chair ann <\s>
<s> they see you coming <\s>
<s> anybody can see you coming daddy <\s>
<s> that's why you ought to be so careful <\s>
<s> i shall make you wear a hard hat <\s>
<s> those squashy hats of yours are hopelessly inefficient <\s>
<s> gazing at his hat calway wears one <\s>
<s> as if anyone would beg of professor calway <\s>
<s> you know ann i admire that fellow <\s>
<s> how a man can be so absolutely tidy in his mind <\s>
<s> has any one begged of you to day <\s>
<s> after a long severe look will you have rum in your tea <\s>
<s> crestfallen yes my dear a good deal <\s>
<s> pouring out the rum and handing him the glass well who was it <\s>
<s> he didn't beg of me <\s>
<s> losing himself in recollection interesting old creature ann real type <\s>
<s> just on the embankment <\s>
<s> daddy you know the embankment ones are always rotters <\s>
<s> yes my dear but this wasn't <\s>
<s> did you give him your card <\s>
<s> i'm rather afraid i may have <\s>
<s> well the old fellow was so awfully human ann <\s>
<s> besides i didn't give him any money hadn't got any <\s>
<s> did you ever ask anybody for anything <\s>
<s> you know you never did you'd starve first <\s>
<s> so would anybody decent <\s>
<s> then why won't you see that people who beg are rotters <\s>
<s> but my dear we're not all the same <\s>
<s> they wouldn't do it if it wasn't natural to them <\s>
<s> one likes to be friendly <\s>
<s> what's the use of being alive if one isn't <\s>
<s> but look here ann the whole thing's so jolly complicated <\s>
<s> according to calway we're to give the state all we can spare to make the undeserving deserving <\s>
<s> he's a professor he ought to know <\s>
<s> but old hoxton's always dinning it into me that we ought to support private organisations for helping the deserving and damn the undeserving <\s>
<s> well that's just the opposite <\s>
<s> and he's a j p <\s>
<s> and the vicar seems to be for a little bit of both <\s>
<s> well what the devil <\s>
<s> my trouble is whichever i'm with he always converts me <\s>
<s> ruefully and there's no fun in any of them <\s>
<s> daddy you are so don't you know that you're the despair of all social reformers <\s>
<s> she envelops him there's a tear in the left knee of your trousers <\s>
<s> you're not to wear them again <\s>

<s> severely now look here daddy <\s>
<s> she takes him by his lapels don't imagine that it isn't the most disgusting luxury on your part to go on giving away things as you do <\s>
<s> you know what you really are i suppose a sickly sentimentalist <\s>
<s> breaking away from her disturbed it isn't sentiment <\s>
<s> it's simply that they seem to me so so jolly <\s>
<s> if i'm to give up feeling sort of nice in here he touches his chest about people it doesn't matter who they are then i don't know what i'm to do <\s>
<s> i shall have to sit with my head in a bag <\s>

<s> i suppose they see i like them then they tell me things <\s>
<s> after that of course you can't help doing what you can <\s>
<s> well if you will love them up <\s>
<s> my dear i don't want to <\s>
<s> it isn't them especially why i feel it even with old calway sometimes <\s>
<s> it's only providence that he doesn't want anything of me except to make me like himself confound him <\s>
<s> moving towards the door into the house impressively what you don't see is that other people aren't a bit like you <\s>

<s> slowly he begins to shake his head and mutter as he moves towards the fire wellwyn <\s>
<s> low type no backbone no stability <\s>
<s> there comes a fluttering knock on the outer door <\s>
<s> as the sound slowly enters his consciousness he begins to wince as though he knew but would not admit its significance <\s>

<s> the knocking does not cease <\s>
<s> wellwyn drops first one then both hands rises and begins to sidle towards the door <\s>
<s> the knocking becomes louder wellwyn <\s>
<s> after a look in the direction of ann's disappearance he opens the street door a very little way <\s>
<s> by the light of the lamp there can be seen a young girl in dark clothes huddled in a shawl to which the snow is clinging <\s>

<s> ferrand coming quietly up behind examines her from above drooping his long nose as if enquiring with it as to her condition in life then he steps back a yard or two ferrand <\s>
<s> springing to her feet oh <\s>

<s> gently we must be good comrades <\s>

<s> he pushes the stool over towards her and seats himself <\s>
<s> megan again sits down mrs <\s>
<s> unexpectedly in a drowsy tone purple foreigners <\s>
<s> pay no attention ma'moiselle <\s>
<s> he is a philosopher <\s>
<s> i thought e was boozed <\s>

<s> i don't like the way you speaks to me <\s>

<s> megan looks at him and slowly smiles mrs <\s>
<s> what do you do for a livin <\s>
<s> i am an interpreter <\s>

<s> you were born loving pleasure <\s>
<s> you see you cannot say no <\s>

<s> that is for you what the road is for me <\s>

<s> yes yes my dear <\s>
<s> with a sort of groan oh <\s>
<s> in the renewed silence the church clock ceases to chime ferrand <\s>
<s> softly in his ironic voice he is come monsieur <\s>
<s> there is a sudden chime of bells <\s>
<s> the stage is blotted dark curtain <\s>
<s> act ii it is four o'clock in the afternoon of new year's day <\s>
<s> on the raised dais mrs <\s>
<s> megan is standing in her rags with bare feet and ankles her dark hair as if blown about her lips parted holding out a dishevelled bunch of violets <\s>
<s> before his easel wellwyn is painting her <\s>
<s> behind him at a table between the cupboard and the door to the model's room timson is washing brushes with the movements of one employed upon relief works <\s>
<s> the samovar is hissing on the table by the stove the tea things are set out <\s>
<s> megan opens her mouth ann <\s>
<s> in hat and coat entering from the house daddy <\s>
<s> wellwyn goes to her and released from restraint mrs <\s>
<s> megan looks round at timson and grimaces wellwyn <\s>
<s> they speak in low voices ann <\s>
<s> holding out a note this note from canon bentley <\s>
<s> he's going to bring her husband here this afternoon <\s>
<s> she looks at mrs <\s>
<s> he also looks at mrs <\s>
<s> and i met sir thomas hoxton at church this morning and spoke to him about timson <\s>

<s> then ann goes back to the door and wellwyn follows her ann <\s>
<s> turning i'm going round now daddy to ask professor calway what we're to do with that ferrand <\s>
<s> i wonder if they'll like it <\s>
<s> they'll have to lump it <\s>
<s> she goes out into the house wellwyn <\s>
<s> back at his easel you can shut your mouth now <\s>
<s> megan shuts her mouth but opens it immediately to smile wellwyn <\s>
<s> now that's what i want <\s>
<s> he dabs furiously at the canvas <\s>
<s> then standing back runs his hands through his hair and turns a painter's glance towards the skylight dash <\s>
<s> off you get child don't tempt me <\s>
<s> passing towards the door of the model's room she stops and stealthily looks at the picture timson <\s>
<s> wheeling round want to have a look <\s>
<s> he takes her by the arm and they stand before the canvas <\s>
<s> after a stolid moment she giggles wellwyn <\s>
<s> who has lost her hoarseness it's not like my picture that i had on the pier <\s>
<s> timidly if i had an at on i'd look better <\s>
<s> i don't like hats and i don't like feathers <\s>
<s> megan timidly tugs his sleeve <\s>
<s> timson screened as he thinks by the picture has drawn from his bulky pocket a bottle and is taking a stealthy swig wellwyn <\s>
<s> megan affecting not to notice how much do i owe you <\s>
<s> a little surprised you paid me for to day all cept a penny <\s>
<s> he gives her a coin go and get your feet on <\s>
<s> you've give me arf a crown <\s>
<s> megan smiling at the coin goes towards the model's room <\s>
<s> she looks back at wellwyn as if to draw his eyes to her but he is gazing at the picture then catching old timson's sour glance she grimaces at him kicking up her feet with a little squeal <\s>
<s> but when wellwyn turns to the sound she is demurely passing through the doorway timson <\s>
<s> in his voice of dubious sobriety i've finished these yer brushes sir <\s>
<s> it's not a man's work <\s>
<s> i've been thinkin if you'd keep an orse i could give yer satisfaction <\s>
<s> would the horse timson <\s>
<s> looking him up and down i knows of one that would just suit yer <\s>
<s> reel orse you'd like im <\s>
<s> shaking his head afraid not timson <\s>
<s> awfully sorry though to have nothing better for you than this at present <\s>
<s> faintly waving the brushes of course if you can't afford it i don't press you it's only that i feel i'm not doing meself justice <\s>
<s> confidentially there's just one thing sir i can't bear to see a gen'leman imposed on <\s>
<s> that foreigner 'e's not the sort to ave about the place <\s>
<s> but e'll never do any good with imself <\s>
<s> terrible misfortune to a fellow timson <\s>
<s> don't you believe it sir it's his fault i says to the young lady yesterday miss ann your father's a gen'leman with a sudden accent of hoarse sincerity and so you are i don't mind sayin it but i said he's too easy goin <\s>
<s> well see that girl now <\s>
<s> he shakes his head i never did believe in goin behind a person's back i'm an englishman but lowering his voice she's a bad hat sir <\s>
<s> why look at the street she comes from <\s>
<s> lived there meself larst three years <\s>
<s> see the difference a few days corn's made in her <\s>
<s> she's that saucy you can't touch er head <\s>
<s> is there any necessity timson <\s>
<s> full o vice i call'er <\s>
<s> you wouldn't like her to timson <\s>
<s> with dignity so that the bottle in his pocket is plainly visible i'm a man as always beared inspection <\s>
<s> with a well directed smile so i see <\s>
<s> curving himself round the bottle it's not for me to say nothing but i can tell a gen'leman as quick as ever i can tell an orse <\s>
<s> painting i find it safest to assume that every man is a gentleman and every woman a lady <\s>
<s> saves no end of self contempt <\s>
<s> give me the little brush <\s>
<s> handing him the brush after a considerable introspective pause would yer like me to stay and wash it for yer again <\s>
<s> with great resolution i will i'll do it for you never grudged workin for a gen'leman <\s>
<s> with sincerity thank you timson very good of you i'm sure <\s>
<s> he hands him back the brush just lend us a hand with this <\s>
<s> assisted by timson he pushes back the dais let's see <\s>
<s> what do i owe you <\s>
<s> reluctantly it so appens you advanced me to day's yesterday <\s>
<s> then i suppose you want to morrow's <\s>
<s> well i ad to spend it lookin for a permanent job <\s>
<s> when you've got to do with orses you can't neglect the publics or you might as well be dead <\s>
<s> it mounts up in the course o the year <\s>
<s> passing him a coin this is for an exceptional purpose timson see <\s>
<s> touching his forehead certainly sir <\s>
<s> i'm not that sort as i think i've proved to yer comin here regular day after day all the week <\s>
<s> there's one thing i ought to warn you perhaps i might ave to give this job up any day <\s>
<s> he makes a faint demonstration with the little brush then puts it absent mindedly into his pocket wellwyn <\s>
<s> gravely i'd never stand in the way of your bettering yourself timson <\s>
<s> and by the way my daughter spoke to a friend about you to day <\s>
<s> i think something may come of it <\s>
<s> well it might do me a bit o good <\s>
<s> he makes for the outer door but stops that foreigner <\s>
<s> e sticks in my gizzard <\s>
<s> it's not as if there wasn't plenty o pigeons for im to pluck in is own gawd forsaken country <\s>
<s> reg lar jay that's what i calls im <\s>
<s> i could tell yer something he has opened the door and suddenly sees that ferrand himself is standing there <\s>
<s> sticking out his lower lip timson gives a roll of his jaw and lurches forth into the street <\s>
<s> owing to a slight miscalculation his face and raised arms are plainly visible through the window as he fortifies himself from his battle against the cold <\s>
<s> ferrand having closed the door stands with his thumb acting as pointer towards this spectacle <\s>
<s> he is now remarkably dressed in an artist's squashy green hat a frock coat too small for him a bright blue tie of knitted silk the grey trousers that were torn well worn brown boots and a tan waistcoat wellwyn <\s>
<s> with a shrug again i have beaten all london monsieur not one bite <\s>
<s> contemplating himself i think perhaps that for the bourgeoisie there is a little too much colour in my costume <\s>
<s> contemplating him let's see i believe i've an old top hat somewhere <\s>
<s> monsieur merci but that i could not <\s>
<s> it is scarcely in my character <\s>
<s> i have been to merchants of wine of tabac to hotels to leicester square <\s>
<s> i have been to a society for spreading christian knowledge i thought there i would have a chance perhaps as interpreter <\s>
<s> toujours meme chose we regret we have no situation for you same thing everywhere <\s>
<s> it seems there is nothing doing in this town <\s>
<s> i've noticed there never is <\s>
<s> i was thinking monsieur that in aviation there might be a career for me but it seems one must be trained <\s>
<s> approaching the picture ah <\s>
<s> you are always working at this <\s>
<s> you will have something of very good there monsieur <\s>
<s> you wish to fix the type of wild savage existing ever amongst our high civilisation <\s>
<s> c'est tres chic ca <\s>
<s> wellwyn manifests the quiet delight of an english artist actually understood in the figures of these good citizens to whom she offers her flower you would give the idea of all the cage doors open to catch and make tame the wild bird that will surely die within <\s>
<s> believe me monsieur you have there the greatest comedy of life <\s>
<s> how anxious are the tame birds to do the wild birds good <\s>
<s> his voice changes for the wild birds it is not funny <\s>
<s> there is in some human souls monsieur what cannot be made tame <\s>
<s> i believe you ferrand <\s>
<s> the face of a young man appears at the window unseen <\s>
<s> suddenly ann opens the door leading to the house ann <\s>
<s> to ferrand excuse me a minute <\s>
<s> he goes to his daughter and they pass out <\s>
<s> ferrand remains at the picture <\s>
<s> megan dressed in some of ann's discarded garments has come out of the model's room <\s>
<s> she steals up behind ferrand like a cat reaches an arm up and curls it round his mouth <\s>
<s> he turns and tries to seize her she disingenuously slips away <\s>
<s> the chase circles the tea table <\s>
<s> he catches her lifts her up swings round with her so that her feet fly out kisses her bent back face and sets her down <\s>
<s> she stands there smiling <\s>
<s> the face at the window darkens ferrand <\s>
<s> he takes her with both hands by the waist she puts her hands against his shoulders to push him of and suddenly they are whirling <\s>
<s> as they whirl they bob together once or twice and kiss <\s>
<s> then with a warning motion towards the door she wrenches herself free and stops beside the picture trying desperately to appear demure <\s>
<s> wellwyn and ann have entered <\s>
<s> the face has vanished ferrand <\s>
<s> pointing to the picture one does not comprehend all this monsieur without well studying <\s>
<s> i was in train to interpret for ma'moiselle the chiaroscuro <\s>
<s> with a queer look don't take it too seriously ferrand <\s>
<s> it is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> my daughter's just spoken to a friend professor calway <\s>
<s> he'd like to meet you <\s>
<s> could you come back a little later <\s>
<s> that will be an opening for me i trust <\s>
<s> he goes to the street door ann <\s>
<s> paying no attention to him mrs <\s>
<s> megan will you too come back in half an hour <\s>
<s> i will see that she does <\s>
<s> we will take a little promenade together <\s>
<s> that will do us good <\s>
<s> he motions towards the door mrs <\s>
<s> megan all eyes follows him out ann <\s>
<s> daddy they are rotters <\s>
<s> couldn't you see they were having the most high jinks <\s>
<s> at his picture i seemed to have noticed something <\s>
<s> preparing for tea they were kissing <\s>
<s> they're hopeless all three especially her <\s>
<s> wish i hadn't given her my clothes now <\s>
<s> absorbed something of wild savage <\s>
<s> thank goodness it's the vicar's business to see that married people live together in his parish <\s>
<s> dubiously the megans are roman catholic atheists ann <\s>
<s> with heat then they're all the more bound <\s>
<s> wellwyn gives a sudden and alarmed whistle ann <\s>
<s> didn't you say you spoke to sir thomas too <\s>
<s> suppose he comes in while the professor's here <\s>
<s> they're cat and dog <\s>
<s> as wellwyn strikes a match the samovar is lighted <\s>
<s> taking up the nearly empty decanter of rum and going to the cupboard it's all right <\s>
<s> he turns back to his picture ann <\s>
<s> at the cupboard daddy <\s>
<s> there were three bottles <\s>
<s> now there aren't any <\s>
<s> abstracted that'll be timson <\s>
<s> with real horror but it's awful <\s>
<s> it is my dear <\s>
<s> to say nothing of the stealing <\s>
<s> vexed i blame myself very much <\s>
<s> ought to have kept it locked up <\s>
<s> you ought to keep him locked up <\s>
<s> there is heard a mild but authoritative knock wellwyn <\s>
<s> what are you going to do about the rum <\s>
<s> opening the door to canon bertley come in vicar <\s>
<s> i've got into touch with her young husband he's coming round <\s>
<s> still a little out of her plate thank go  moses <\s>
<s> faintly surprised from what i hear he's not really a bad youth <\s>
<s> afraid he bets on horses <\s>
<s> the great thing wellwyn with those poor fellows is to put your finger on the weak spot <\s>
<s> to herself gloomily that's not difficult <\s>
<s> what would you do canon bertley with a man who's been drinking father's rum <\s>
<s> remove the temptation of course <\s>
<s> then wellwyn and ann hang on his words then i should er ann <\s>
<s> before i say that ann i must certainly see the individual <\s>
<s> pointing to the window there he is <\s>
<s> in the failing light timson's face is indeed to be seen pressed against the window pane ann <\s>
<s> daddy i do wish you'd have thick glass put in <\s>
<s> it's so disgusting to be spied at <\s>
<s> wellwyn going quickly to the door has opened it what do you want <\s>
<s> timson enters with dignity <\s>
<s> he is fuddled timson <\s>
<s> slowly arskin yer pardon thought it me duty to come back found thish yer little brishel on me <\s>
<s> he produces the little paint brush ann <\s>
<s> in a deadly voice nothing else <\s>
<s> timson accords her a glassy stare wellwyn <\s>
<s> taking the brush hastily that'll do timson thanks <\s>
<s> as i am ere can i do anything for yer <\s>
<s> yes you can sweep out that little room <\s>
<s> she points to the model's room there's a broom in there <\s>
<s> disagreeably surprised certainly never make bones about a little extra never ave in all me life <\s>
<s> do it at onsh i will <\s>
<s> he moves across to the model's room at that peculiar broad gait so perfectly adjusted to his habits you quite understand me couldn't bear to ave anything on me that wasn't mine <\s>
<s> he passes out ann <\s>
<s> mark my words he'll restore the bottles <\s>
<s> but my dear wellwyn that is stealing <\s>
<s> we all have our discrepancies vicar <\s>
<s> well ann my theory is that as regards solids timson's an individualist but as regards liquids he's a socialist <\s>
<s> or vice versa according to taste <\s>
<s> no no we mustn't joke about it <\s>
<s> gravely i do think he should be spoken to <\s>
<s> yes but not by me <\s>
<s> surely you're the proper person <\s>
<s> shaking his head it was my rum vicar <\s>
<s> there sound a number of little tat tat knocks wellwyn <\s>
<s> isn't that the professor's knock <\s>
<s> while ann sits down to make tea he goes to the door and opens it <\s>
<s> there dressed in an ulster stands a thin clean shaved man with a little hollow sucked into either cheek who taking off a grey squash hat discloses a majestically bald forehead which completely dominates all that comes below it wellwyn <\s>
<s> so awfully good of you <\s>
<s> you know canon bentley i think <\s>
<s> your opinion will be invaluable professor <\s>
<s> they have assembled round the tea table calway <\s>
<s> thank you no tea milk <\s>
<s> he pours rum into calway's milk calway <\s>
<s> turning to ann you were going to show me some one you're trying to rescue or something i think <\s>
<s> he'll be here directly simply perfect rotter <\s>
<s> i think you said he was a congenital <\s>
<s> with great interest what <\s>
<s> to calway yes i i think that's what you call him <\s>
<s> no and quite healthy a vagabond <\s>
<s> is it do you think chronic unemployment with a vagrant tendency <\s>
<s> or would it be nearer the mark to say vagrancy wellwyn <\s>
<s> with a smile of knowledge quite <\s>
<s> breaking in before he comes there's another bertley <\s>
<s> blandly yes when you came in we were discussing what should be done with a man who drinks rum calway pauses in the act of drinking that doesn't belong to him <\s>
<s> well perhaps you could tell us drink certainly changing thine to mine <\s>
<s> the professor could see him wellwyn <\s>
<s> rising yes do come and look at him professor calway <\s>
<s> she points towards the model's room <\s>
<s> calway smiles deprecatingly ann <\s>
<s> no really we needn't open the door <\s>
<s> you can see him through the glass <\s>
<s> he's more than half calway <\s>
<s> well i hardly ann <\s>
<s> come on professor calway <\s>
<s> we must know what to do with him <\s>
<s> calway rises you can stand on a chair <\s>
<s> she draws calway to the model's room which is lighted by a glass panel in the top of the high door <\s>
<s> canon bertley also rises and stands watching <\s>
<s> wellwyn hovers torn between respect for science and dislike of espionage ann <\s>
<s> drawing up a chair come on <\s>
<s> do you seriously wish me to <\s>
<s> it's quite safe he can't see you <\s>
<s> but he might come out <\s>
<s> ann puts her back against the door <\s>
<s> calway mounts the chair dubiously and raises his head cautiously bending it more and more downwards ann <\s>
<s> he appears to be  sitting on the floor <\s>
<s> yes that's all right <\s>
<s> bertley covers his lips calway <\s>
<s> to ann descending by the look of his face as far as one can see it i should say there was a leaning towards mania <\s>
<s> i know the treatment <\s>
<s> there come three loud knocks on the door <\s>
<s> wellwyn and ann exchange a glance of consternation ann <\s>
<s> it sounds like sir thomas <\s>
<s> nodding awfully sorry professor <\s>
<s> you see we calway <\s>
<s> only i must decline to be involved in argument with him please <\s>
<s> we might get his opinion don't you think <\s>
<s> on a point of reform <\s>
<s> deprecating my dear sir we needn't take it <\s>
<s> the three knocks resound with extraordinary fury ann <\s>
<s> you'd better open the door daddy <\s>
<s> wellwyn opens the door <\s>
<s> sir thomas hoxton is disclosed in a fur overcoat and top hat <\s>
<s> his square well coloured face is remarkable for a massive jaw dominating all that comes above it <\s>
<s> his voice is resolute hoxton <\s>
<s> afraid i didn't make myself heard <\s>
<s> so good of you to come sir thomas <\s>
<s> they greet professor calway you know i think <\s>
<s> an awkward pause ann <\s>
<s> blurting it out that old cabman i told you of's been drinking father's rum <\s>
<s> we were just discussing what's to be done with him sir thomas <\s>
<s> one wants to do the very best of course <\s>
<s> the question of reform is always delicate <\s>
<s> i beg your pardon <\s>
<s> there is no question here <\s>
<s> is he in the house <\s>
<s> works for you eh <\s>
<s> let's have a look at him <\s>
<s> an embarrassed pause bertley <\s>
<s> well the fact is sir thomas calway <\s>
<s> when last under observation ann <\s>
<s> he was sitting on the floor <\s>
<s> i don't want the old fellow to feel he's being made a show of <\s>
<s> disgusting to be spied at ann <\s>
<s> never mind miss wellwyn <\s>
<s> hundreds of these fellows before me in my time <\s>
<s> at calway the only thing is a sharp lesson <\s>
<s> i've seen the man what he requires is steady control and the bobbins treatment <\s>
<s> wellwyn approaches them with fearful interest hoxton <\s>
<s> not a bit of it <\s>
<s> he wants one for his knob <\s>
<s> it's the only thing <\s>
<s> personally i think that if he were spoken to seriously calway <\s>
<s> i cannot walk arm in arm with a crab <\s>
<s> approaching calway i beg your pardon <\s>
<s> moving back a little you're moving backwards sir thomas <\s>
<s> i've told you before convinced reactionaryism in these days there comes a single knock on the street door bertley <\s>
<s> looking at his watch d'you know i'm rather afraid this may be our young husband wellwyn <\s>
<s> i told him half past four <\s>
<s> going towards the two reformers shall we go into the house professor and settle the question quietly while the vicar sees a young man <\s>
<s> pale with uncompleted statement and gravitating insensibly in the direction indicated the merest sense of continuity a simple instinct for order hoxton <\s>
<s> following the only way to get order sir is to bring the disorderly up with a round turn <\s>
<s> calway turns to him in the doorway you people without practical experience calway <\s>
<s> if you'll listen to me a minute <\s>
<s> i can show you in a mo they vanish through the door wellwyn <\s>
<s> i was afraid of it <\s>
<s> the two points of view <\s>
<s> pleasant to see such keenness <\s>
<s> i may want you wellwyn <\s>
<s> and ann perhaps had better not be present <\s>
<s> wellwyn opens the street door <\s>
<s> the lamp outside has just been lighted and by its gleam is seen the figure of rory megan thin pale youthful <\s>
<s> ann turning at the door into the house gives him a long inquisitive look then goes wellwyn <\s>
<s> there follows an awkward silence during which wellwyn turns up the light then goes to the tea table and pours out a glass of tea and rum bertley <\s>
<s> kindly now my boy how is it that you and your wife are living apart like this <\s>
<s> well if you don't none of us are very likely to are we <\s>
<s> that's what i thought as i was comin along <\s>
<s> twinkling have some tea megan <\s>
<s> handing him the glass what d'you think of her picture <\s>
<s> after scrutiny i seen her look like it once <\s>
<s> stoically when she ad the measles <\s>
<s> i quite see feverish <\s>
<s> my dear wellwyn let me to megan now i hope you're willing to come together again and to maintain her <\s>
<s> if she'll maintain me <\s>
<s> but i see you mean you're in the same line of business <\s>
<s> and lean on each other <\s>
<s> i leans on er mostly with er looks <\s>
<s> sometimes she'll take arf a crown off of a toff <\s>
<s> he looks at wellwyn wellwyn <\s>
<s> twinkling i apologise to you megan <\s>
<s> with a faint smile i could do with a bit more of it <\s>
<s> now my boy i've heard you bet on horses <\s>
<s> don't be afraid to acknowledge it <\s>
<s> when i'm ard up yus <\s>
<s> but don't you know that's ruination <\s>
<s> sometimes i wins a lot <\s>
<s> you know that's not at all what i mean <\s>
<s> come promise me to give it up <\s>
<s> i dunno abaht that <\s>
<s> now there's a good fellow <\s>
<s> make a big effort and throw the habit off <\s>
<s> comes over me same as it might over you <\s>
<s> how do you mean my boy <\s>
<s> with a look up to tork <\s>
<s> wellwyn turning to the picture makes a funny little noise bertley <\s>
<s> maintaining his good humour a hit <\s>
<s> but you forget you know to talk's my business <\s>
<s> it's not yours to gamble <\s>
<s> you try sellin flowers <\s>
<s> if that ain't a gamble bertley <\s>
<s> i'm afraid we're wandering a little from the point <\s>

<s> i thought i saw her last night <\s>
<s> you can't tell me her address i suppose <\s>
<s> shaking his head the husband too has quite passed out of my ken <\s>
<s> he betted on horses you remember <\s>
<s> i'm sometimes tempted to believe there's nothing for some of these poor folk but to pray for death <\s>
<s> ann has entered from the house <\s>
<s> her hair hangs from under a knitted cap <\s>
<s> she wears a white wool jersey and a loose silk scarf bertley <\s>
<s> i was telling your father of that poor little mrs <\s>

<s> we haven't seen him since <\s>
<s> she looks searchingly at wellwyn at least have you daddy <\s>
<s> rather hurt no my dear i have not <\s>

<s> said he was tired of life but they didn't believe him <\s>
<s> rather a score for sir thomas <\s>
<s> i suppose he'd told the professor <\s>

<s> well the professor said with a quick glance at bertley he felt there was nothing for some of these poor devils but a lethal chamber <\s>
<s> shocked did he really <\s>
<s> he has not yet caught wellwyn s glance wellwyn <\s>

<s> preparing to go you'll let us know then when you're settled <\s>

<s> uneasily good sorts they look those fellows <\s>
<s> scrutinising him what have you done <\s>
<s> nothing my dear really <\s>
<s> i i rather think i may have tipped them twice <\s>
<s> if it is the first of april it's not necessary to make a fool of oneself <\s>
<s> that's the last time you ever do these ridiculous things <\s>
<s> wellwyn eyes her askance i'm going to see that you spend your money on yourself <\s>
<s> you needn't look at me like that <\s>
<s> as soon as i've got you away from here and all these wellwyn <\s>
<s> don't rub it in ann <\s>
<s> giving him a sudden hug then going to the door with a sort of triumph deeds not words daddy <\s>
<s> she goes out and the wind catching her scarf blows it out beneath her firm young chin <\s>
<s> wellwyn returning to the fire stands brooding and gazing at his extinct cigarette wellwyn <\s>
<s> to himself bad lot low type <\s>
<s> in the open doorway appear ferrand and mrs <\s>
<s> they stand unseen looking at him <\s>
<s> ferrand is more ragged if possible than on christmas eve <\s>
<s> his chin and cheeks are clothed in a reddish golden beard <\s>
<s> megan's dress is not so woe begone but her face is white her eyes dark circled <\s>
<s> she slips back into the shadow of the doorway <\s>
<s> wellwyn turns at the sound and stares at ferrand in amazement ferrand <\s>
<s> advancing enchanted to see you monsieur <\s>
<s> he looks round the empty room you are leaving <\s>
<s> nodding then taking the young man's hand how goes it <\s>
<s> displaying himself simply as you see monsieur <\s>
<s> i have done of my best <\s>
<s> it still flies from me <\s>
<s> sadly as if against his will ferrand it will always fly <\s>
<s> the young foreigner shivers suddenly from head to foot then controls himself with a great effort ferrand <\s>
<s> don't say that monsieur <\s>
<s> it is too much the echo of my heart <\s>
<s> i didn't mean to pain you <\s>
<s> drawing nearer the fire that old cabby monsieur you remember they tell me he nearly succeeded to gain happiness the other day <\s>
<s> and those sirs so interested in him with their theories <\s>
<s> he has worn them out <\s>
<s> wellwyn nods that goes without saying <\s>
<s> and now they wish for him the lethal chamber <\s>
<s> startled how did you know that <\s>
<s> there is silence ferrand <\s>
<s> staring into the fire monsieur while i was on the road this time i fell ill of a fever <\s>
<s> it seemed to me in my illness that i saw the truth how i was wasting in this world i would never be good for any one nor any one for me all would go by and i never of it fame and fortune and peace even the necessities of life ever mocking me <\s>
<s> he draws closer to the fire spreading his fingers to the flame <\s>
<s> and while he is speaking through the doorway mrs <\s>
<s> megan creeps in to listen ferrand <\s>
<s> speaking on into the fire and i saw monsieur so plain that i should be vagabond all my days and my days short i dying in the end the death of a dog <\s>
<s> i saw it all in my fever clear as that flame there was nothing for us others but the herb of death <\s>
<s> wellwyn takes his arm and presses it and so monsieur i wished to die <\s>
<s> i told no one of my fever <\s>
<s> i lay out on the ground it was verree cold <\s>
<s> but they would not let me die on the roads of their parishes they took me to an institution monsieur i looked in their eyes while i lay there and i saw more clear than the blue heaven that they thought it best that i should die although they would not let me <\s>
<s> then monsieur naturally my spirit rose and i said so much the worse for you <\s>
<s> i will live a little more <\s>
<s> one is made like that <\s>
<s> life is sweet monsieur <\s>
<s> yes ferrand life is sweet <\s>
<s> that little girl you had here monsieur wellwyn nods in her too there is something of wild savage <\s>
<s> she must have joy of life <\s>
<s> i have seen her since i came back <\s>
<s> she has embraced the life of joy <\s>
<s> it is not quite the same thing <\s>
<s> he lowers his voice she is lost monsieur as a stone that sinks in water <\s>
<s> i can see if she cannot <\s>
<s> as wellwyn makes a movement of distress oh <\s>
<s> i am not to blame for that monsieur <\s>
<s> it had well begun before i knew her <\s>
<s> yes yes i was afraid of it at the time <\s>
<s> megan turns silently and slips away feerrand <\s>
<s> i do my best for her monsieur but look at me <\s>
<s> besides i am not good for her it is not good for simple souls to be with those who see things clear <\s>
<s> for the great part of mankind to see anything is fatal <\s>
<s> even for you it seems <\s>
<s> to be so near to death has done me good i shall not lack courage any more till the wind blows on my grave <\s>
<s> since i saw you monsieur i have been in three institutions <\s>
<s> one may eat upon the floor though it is true for kings they eat too much of skilly there <\s>
<s> one little thing they lack those palaces <\s>
<s> it is understanding of the uman heart <\s>
<s> in them tame birds pluck wild birds naked <\s>
<s> monsieur i am loafer waster what you like for all that bitterly poverty is my only crime <\s>
<s> if i were rich should i not be simply veree original ighly respected with soul above commerce travelling to see the world <\s>
<s> and that young girl would she not be that charming ladee veree chic you know <\s>
<s> and the old tims good old fashioned gentleman drinking his liquor well <\s>
<s> bien what are we now <\s>
<s> dark beasts despised by all <\s>
<s> that is life monsieur <\s>
<s> he stares into the fire wellwyn <\s>
<s> we're our own enemies ferrand <\s>
<s> i can afford it you can't <\s>
<s> earnestly monsieur do you know this <\s>
<s> you are the sole being that can do us good we hopeless ones <\s>
<s> shaking his head not a bit of it i'm hopeless too <\s>
<s> eagerly monsieur it is just that <\s>
<s> when we are with you we feel something here he touches his heart if i had one prayer to make it would be good god give me to understand <\s>
<s> those sirs with their theories they can clean our skins and chain our abits that soothes for them the aesthetic sense it gives them too their good little importance <\s>
<s> but our spirits they cannot touch for they nevare understand <\s>
<s> without that monsieur all is dry as a parched skin of orange <\s>
<s> don't be so bitter <\s>
<s> think of all the work they do <\s>
<s> monsieur of their industry i say nothing <\s>
<s> they do a good work while they attend with their theories to the sick and the tame old and the good unfortunate deserving <\s>
<s> above all to the little children <\s>
<s> but monsieur when all is done there are always us hopeless ones <\s>
<s> what can they do with me monsieur with that girl or with that old man <\s>
<s> monsieur we too ave our qualities we others it wants you courage to undertake a career like mine or like that young girl's <\s>
<s> we wild ones we know a thousand times more of life than ever will those sirs <\s>
<s> they waste their time trying to make rooks white <\s>
<s> be kind to us if you will or let us alone like mees ann but do not try to change our skins <\s>
<s> leave us to live or leave us to die when we like in the free air <\s>
<s> if you do not wish of us you have but to shut your pockets and your doors we shall die the faster <\s>
<s> with agitation but that you know we can't do now can we <\s>
<s> if you cannot how is it our fault <\s>
<s> the harm we do to others is it so much <\s>
<s> if i am criminal dangerous shut me up <\s>
<s> i would not pity myself nevare <\s>
<s> but we in whom something moves like that flame monsieur that cannot keep still we others we are not many that must have motion in our lives do not let them make us prisoners with their theories because we are not like them it is life itself they would enclose <\s>
<s> he draws up his tattered figure then bending over the fire again i ask your pardon i am talking <\s>
<s> if i could smoke monsieur <\s>
<s> wellwyn hands him a tobacco pouch and he rolls a cigarette with his yellow stained fingers ferrand <\s>
<s> the good god made me so that i would rather walk a whole month of nights hungry with the stars than sit one single day making round business on an office stool <\s>
<s> it is not to my advantage <\s>
<s> i cannot help it that i am a vagabond <\s>
<s> what would you have <\s>
<s> it is stronger than me <\s>
<s> he looks suddenly at wellwyn monsieur i say to you things i have never said <\s>

<s> in a voice sharpened by emotion let me try monsieur <\s>
<s> touching his arm you keep off my lad <\s>

<s> from the street comes the noise of distant shouting <\s>

<s> and then sherratt i think it was began it and you saw the anger rising in them but he kept them down his quietness <\s>
<s> i've never seen anything like it there <\s>
<s> then there was a whisper all over the house that fighting had begun <\s>
<s> and the whole thing broke out regular riot as if they could have killed him <\s>
<s> some one tried to drag him down by the coat tails but he shook him off and went on <\s>
<s> then he stopped dead and walked out and the noise dropped like a stone <\s>
<s> the whole thing didn't last five minutes <\s>
<s> it was fine mrs <\s>

<s> they do not dare to kiss and hubert goes out very stiff and straight in the doorway passing steel of whom he takes no notice <\s>
<s> steel hesitates and would go away <\s>
<s> the deputation from toulmin ought to be here mrs <\s>

<s> you can go out on the terrace a little and then you must go up <\s>
<s> olive goes reluctantly out on to the terrace steel <\s>
<s> awful news this morning of that pass <\s>
<s> and have you seen these <\s>
<s> reading from the newspaper we will have no truck with the jargon of the degenerate who vilifies his country at such a moment <\s>
<s> the member for toulmin has earned for himself the contempt of all virile patriots <\s>
<s> he takes up a second journal there is a certain type of public man who even at his own expense cannot resist the itch to advertise himself <\s>
<s> we would at moments of national crisis muzzle such persons as we muzzle dogs that we suspect of incipient rabies <\s>
<s> they're in full cry after him <\s>
<s> i mind much more all the creatures who are always flinging mud at the country making him their hero suddenly <\s>
<s> you know what's in his mind <\s>
<s> we must get him to give up that idea of lecturing everywhere against the war mrs <\s>
<s> more we simply must <\s>
<s> listening the deputation's come <\s>
<s> go and fetch him mr <\s>
<s> he'll be in his room at the house <\s>
<s> steel goes out and katherine stands at bay <\s>
<s> in a moment he opens the door again to usher in the deputation then retires <\s>
<s> the four gentlemen have entered as if conscious of grave issues <\s>
<s> the first and most picturesque is james home a thin tall grey bearded man with plentiful hair contradictious eyebrows and the half shy half bold manners alternately rude and over polite of one not accustomed to society yet secretly much taken with himself <\s>
<s> he is dressed in rough tweeds with a red silk tie slung through a ring and is closely followed by mark wace a waxy round faced man of middle age with sleek dark hair traces of whisker and a smooth way of continually rubbing his hands together as if selling something to an esteemed customer <\s>
<s> he is rather stout wears dark clothes with a large gold chain <\s>
<s> following him comes charles shelder a lawyer of fifty with a bald egg shaped head and gold pince nez <\s>
<s> he has little side whiskers a leathery yellowish skin a rather kind but watchful and dubious face and when he speaks seems to have a plum in his mouth which arises from the preponderance of his shaven upper lip <\s>
<s> last of the deputation comes william banning an energetic looking square shouldered self made country man between fifty and sixty with grey moustaches ruddy face and lively brown eyes katherine <\s>
<s> how do you do mr <\s>
<s> bowing rather extravagantly over her hand as if to show his independence of women's influence mrs <\s>
<s> we hardly expected this is an honour <\s>
<s> how do you do ma'am <\s>
<s> thank you ma'am well indeed <\s>
<s> how d'you do mrs <\s>
<s> very well thank you mr <\s>
<s> speaking with a rather broad country accent this is but a poor occasion ma'am <\s>
<s> do sit down gentlemen <\s>
<s> seeing that they will not settle down while she is standing she sits at the table <\s>
<s> they gradually take their seats <\s>
<s> each member of the deputation in his own way is severely hanging back from any mention of the subject in hand and katherine as intent on drawing them to it <\s>
<s> my husband will be here in two minutes <\s>
<s> he's only over at the house <\s>
<s> who is of higher standing and education than the others charming position this mrs <\s>
<s> so near the er centre of gravity um <\s>
<s> i read the account of your second meeting at toulmin <\s>
<s> there's no disguising it <\s>
<s> that speech was moon summer madness ah <\s>
<s> take a lot of explaining away <\s>
<s> why did you let him now <\s>
<s> not your views i'm sure <\s>
<s> he looks at her but for answer she only compresses her lips banning <\s>
<s> i tell you what hit me what's hit the whole constituency and that's his knowing we were over the frontier fighting already when he made it <\s>
<s> what difference does it make if he did know <\s>
<s> hitting below the belt i should have thought you'll pardon me <\s>
<s> till war's begun mrs <\s>
<s> more you're entitled to say what you like no doubt but after <\s>
<s> that's going against your country <\s>
<s> his speech was strong you know his speech was strong <\s>
<s> he had made up his mind to speak <\s>
<s> it was just an accident the news coming then <\s>
<s> well that's true i suppose <\s>
<s> what we really want is to make sure he won't break out again <\s>
<s> very high minded his views of course but some consideration for the common herd <\s>
<s> we've come with the friendliest feelings mrs <\s>
<s> more but you know it won't do this sort of thing <\s>
<s> we shall be able to smooth him down <\s>
<s> we'd be best perhaps not to mention about his knowing that fighting had begun <\s>
<s> as he speaks more enters through the french windows <\s>
<s> they all rise more <\s>
<s> he comes down to the table but does not offer to shake hands banning <\s>
<s> you've made a woeful mistake sir i tell you to your face <\s>
<s> as everybody else does banning <\s>
<s> sit down again please <\s>
<s> they gradually resume their seats and more sits in katherine's chair <\s>
<s> she alone remains standing leaning against the corner of the bay window watching their faces banning <\s>
<s> you've seen the morning's telegrams <\s>
<s> i tell you mr <\s>
<s> more another reverse like that and the flood will sweep you clean away <\s>
<s> and i'll not blame it <\s>
<s> it's only flesh and blood <\s>
<s> more allow for the flesh and blood in me too please <\s>
<s> when i spoke the other night it was not without a certain feeling here <\s>
<s> he touches his heart banning <\s>
<s> but your attitude's so sudden you'd not been going that length when you were down with us in may <\s>
<s> do me the justice to remember that even then i was against our policy <\s>
<s> it cost me three weeks hard struggle to make up my mind to that speech <\s>
<s> one comes slowly to these things banning <\s>
<s> such things have happened shelder even in politics <\s>
<s> you see our ideals are naturally low how different from yours <\s>
<s> more smiles katherine who has drawn near her husband moves back again as if relieved at this gleam of geniality <\s>
<s> wace rubs his hands <\s>
<s> there's one thing you forget sir <\s>
<s> we send you to parliament representing us but you couldn't find six men in the whole constituency that would have bidden you to make that speech <\s>
<s> i'm sorry but i can't help my convictions banning <\s>
<s> what was it the prophet was without in his own country <\s>
<s> but we're not funning mr <\s>
<s> i've never known feeling run so high <\s>
<s> the sentiment of both meetings was dead against you <\s>
<s> we've had showers of letters to headquarters <\s>
<s> some from very good men very warm friends of yours <\s>
<s> it's not too late <\s>
<s> let's go back and tell them you won't do it again <\s>
<s> bluntly that's about it <\s>
<s> give up my principles to save my parliamentary skin <\s>
<s> then indeed they might call me a degenerate <\s>
<s> he touches the newspapers on the table katherine makes an abrupt and painful movement then remains as still as before leaning against the corner of the window seat <\s>
<s> but we don't ask you to take your words back we only want discretion in the future <\s>
<s> and have it said that a mob of newspapers have hounded me to it <\s>
<s> they won't say that of you <\s>
<s> my dear more aren't you rather dropping to our level <\s>
<s> with your principles you ought not to care two straws what people say <\s>
<s> i can't betray the dignity and courage of public men <\s>
<s> if popular opinion is to control the utterances of her politicians then good bye indeed to this country <\s>
<s> i won't say that your views weren't sound enough before the fighting began <\s>
<s> i've never liked our policy out there <\s>
<s> but our blood's being spilled and that makes all the difference <\s>
<s> i don't suppose they'd want me exactly but i'd be ready to go myself <\s>
<s> we'd all of us be ready <\s>
<s> and we can't have the man that represents us talking wild until we've licked these fellows <\s>
<s> that's it in a nutshell <\s>
<s> i understand your feeling banning <\s>
<s> i tender you my resignation <\s>
<s> i can't and won't hold on where i'm not wanted <\s>
<s> his accent broader and broader you've ad your say and there it is <\s>
<s> you've been our member nine years in rain and shine <\s>
<s> we want to keep you more <\s>
<s> give us your promise that's a good man <\s>
<s> i don't make cheap promises <\s>
<s> you ask too much <\s>
<s> there is silence and they all look at more shelder <\s>
<s> there are very excellent reasons for the government's policy <\s>
<s> there are always excellent reasons for having your way with the weak <\s>
<s> my dear more how can you get up any enthusiasm for those cattle lifting ruffians <\s>
<s> better lift cattle than lift freedom <\s>
<s> well all we'll ask is that you shouldn't go about the country saying so <\s>
<s> but that is just what i must do <\s>
<s> again they all look at more in consternation home <\s>
<s> not down our way you'll pardon me <\s>
<s> the time of crusades is past more <\s>
<s> no but we don't want to part with you mr <\s>
<s> it's a bitter thing this after three elections <\s>
<s> look at the uman side of it <\s>
<s> to speak ill of your country when there's been a disaster like this terrible business in the pass <\s>
<s> there's your own wife <\s>
<s> i see her brother's regiment's to start this very afternoon <\s>
<s> come now how must she feel <\s>
<s> more breaks away to the bay window <\s>
<s> the deputation exchange glances <\s>
<s> turning to try to muzzle me like this is going too far <\s>
<s> we just want to put you out of temptation <\s>
<s> i've held my seat with you in all weathers for nine years <\s>
<s> you've all been bricks to me <\s>
<s> my heart's in my work banning i'm not eager to undergo political eclipse at forty <\s>
<s> just so we don't want to see you in that quandary <\s>
<s> it'd be no friendliness to give you a wrong impression of the state of feeling <\s>
<s> silence till the bitterness is overpast there's naught else for it mr <\s>
<s> more while you feel as you do <\s>
<s> that tongue of yours <\s>
<s> you owe us something <\s>
<s> you're a big man it's the big view you ought to take <\s>
<s> i am trying to <\s>
<s> and what precisely is your view you'll pardon my asking <\s>
<s> turning on him mr <\s>
<s> home a great country such as ours is trustee for the highest sentiments of mankind <\s>
<s> do these few outrages justify us in stealing the freedom of this little people <\s>
<s> that's rather running before the hounds <\s>
<s> now we come to it <\s>
<s> in your hearts you're none of you for that neither by force nor fraud <\s>
<s> and yet you all know that we've gone in there to stay as we've gone into other lands as all we big powers go into other lands when they're little and weak <\s>
<s> the prime minister's words the other night were these if we are forced to spend this blood and money now we must never again be forced <\s>
<s> what does that mean but swallowing this country <\s>
<s> well and quite frankly it'd be no bad thing <\s>
<s> we don't want their wretched country we're forced <\s>
<s> we are not forced <\s>
<s> my dear more what is civilization but the logical inevitable swallowing up of the lower by the higher types of man <\s>
<s> and what else will it be here <\s>
<s> we shall not agree there shelder and we might argue it all day <\s>
<s> but the point is not whether you or i are right the point is what is a man who holds a faith with all his heart to do <\s>
<s> there is a silence banning <\s>
<s> simply i was just thinkin of those poor fellows in the pass <\s>
<s> i can see them as well as you banning <\s>
<s> up in our own country the black valley twelve hundred foreign devils dead and dying the crows busy over them in our own country our own valley ours ours violated <\s>
<s> would you care about the poor fellows in that pass invading stealing dogs <\s>
<s> you would and i would too <\s>
<s> the passion of those words touches and grips as no arguments could and they are silent <\s>
<s> what's the difference out there <\s>
<s> i'm not so inhuman as not to want to see this disaster in the pass wiped out <\s>
<s> but once that's done in spite of my affection for you my ambitions and they're not few very low in spite of my own wife's feeling i must be free to raise my voice against this war <\s>
<s> speaking slowly consulting the others as it were with his eyes mr <\s>
<s> more there's no man i respect more than yourself <\s>
<s> i can't tell what they'll say down there when we go back but i for one don't feel it in me to take a hand in pressing you farther against your faith <\s>
<s> we don't deny that that you have a case of sorts <\s>
<s> a man should be free i suppose to hold his own opinions <\s>
<s> we must take you as you are but it's a rare pity there'll be a lot of trouble his eyes light on honk who is leaning forward with hand raised to his ear listening <\s>
<s> very faint from far in the distance there is heard a skirling sound <\s>
<s> all become conscious of it all listen <\s>
<s> the figure of olive flies past the window out on the terrace <\s>
<s> katherine turns as if to follow her <\s>
<s> katherine goes quickly out on to the terrace <\s>

<s> he paces the room taking in some sort the rhythm of the march slowly the music dies away in the distance to a drum tap and the tramp of a company <\s>
<s> more stops at the table covering his eyes with his hands the deputation troop back across the terrace and come in at the french windows <\s>
<s> their faces and manners have quite changed <\s>
<s> katherine follows them as far as the window home <\s>
<s> in a strange almost threatening voice it won't do mr <\s>
<s> give us your word to hold your peace <\s>
<s> we must have it <\s>
<s> without lifting his head i i the drum tap of a regiment marching is heard <\s>
<s> can you hear that go by man when your country's just been struck <\s>
<s> now comes the scale and mutter of a following crowd <\s>
<s> i give you then sharp and clear above all other sounds the words give the beggars hell boys <\s>

<s> don't leave em a gory acre <\s>
<s> and a burst of hoarse cheering <\s>

<s> venomously his eyes darting between more and katherine go and stump the country <\s>

<s> there is an ugly rush checked by the fall of the foremost figures thrown too suddenly against the bottom step <\s>
<s> there is a momentary lull and more stares steadily down at them <\s>
<s> don't e speak well <\s>
<s> two or three nutshells and a piece of orange peel strike more across the face <\s>

<s> give im some encouragement <\s>
<s> the jeering laughter is changed to anger by the contemptuous smile on more's face <\s>
<s> don't stand there like a stuck pig <\s>

<s> under cover of the applause that greets this he strikes more across the legs with a belt <\s>

<s> still looking up at more the whole crowd falls into an uneasy silence broken only by the shuffling of feet <\s>
<s> then the big navvy in the front rank turns and elbows his way out to the edge of the crowd <\s>
<s> with half sullen and half shamefaced acquiescence the crowd breaks up and drifts back whence it came till the alley is nearly empty <\s>
<s> as if coming to out of a trance wiping his hand and dusting his coat well steel <\s>

<s> two policemen pass glancing up at the broken glass <\s>

<s> scene ii the window end of katherine's bedroom panelled in cream coloured wood <\s>
<s> the light from four candles is falling on katherine who is sitting before the silver mirror of an old oak dressing table brushing her hair <\s>
<s> a door on the left stands ajar <\s>
<s> an oak chair against the wall close to a recessed window is all the other furniture <\s>
<s> through this window the blue night is seen where a mist is rolled out flat amongst trees so that only dark clumps of boughs show here and there beneath a moonlit sky <\s>
<s> as the curtain rises katherine with brush arrested is listening <\s>
<s> she begins again brushing her hair then stops and taking a packet of letters from a drawer of her dressing table reads <\s>
<s> through the just open door behind her comes the voice of olive <\s>
<s> but katherine goes on reading and olive steals into the room in her nightgown <\s>
<s> at katherine's elbow examining her watch on its stand it's fourteen minutes to eleven <\s>
<s> i just wanted to see the time <\s>
<s> i never can go to sleep if i try it's quite helpless you know <\s>

<s> the night that man was here whose head's too bald for anything oh <\s>
<s> mummy you know the one who cleans his teeth so termendously i heard daddy making a speech to the wind <\s>
<s> it broke a wine glass <\s>

<s> it felt funny you couldn't see any wind you know <\s>
<s> talking to the wind is an expression olive <\s>
<s> what does it mean <\s>
<s> speaking to people who won't listen <\s>
<s> what do they do then <\s>
<s> just a few people go to hear him and then a great crowd comes and breaks in or they wait for him outside and throw things and hoot <\s>
<s> is it people on our side who throw things <\s>
<s> yes but only rough people <\s>
<s> why does he go on doing it <\s>
<s> he thinks it is his duty <\s>

<s> as they pass through the door you're tickling under my knee <\s>

<s> then a drowsy voice i must keep awake for daddy <\s>
<s> she is about to leave the door a little open when she hears a knock on the other door <\s>
<s> it is opened a few inches and nurse's voice says can i come in ma'am <\s>
<s> the nurse comes in <\s>
<s> shutting olive's door and going up to her what is it nurse <\s>
<s> speaking in a low voice i've been meaning to i'll never do it in the daytime <\s>

<s> in my paper they say he's encouraging these heathens and makin the foreigners talk about us and every day longer the war lasts there's our blood on this house <\s>

<s> katherine turns back to her glass puts back her hair and smooths her lips and eyes <\s>
<s> the door from the corridor is opened and helen's voice says kit <\s>
<s> you're not in bed <\s>
<s> helen too is in a wrapper with a piece of lace thrown over her head <\s>
<s> her face is scared and miserable and she runs into katherine's arms <\s>
<s> my dear what is it <\s>
<s> staring before her i'd just fallen asleep and i saw a plain that seemed to run into the sky like that fog <\s>
<s> and on it there were dark things <\s>
<s> one grew into a body without a head and a gun by its side <\s>
<s> and one was a man sitting huddled up nursing a wounded leg <\s>
<s> he had the face of hubert's servant wreford <\s>
<s> and then i saw hubert <\s>
<s> his face was all dark and thin and he had a wound an awful wound here she touches her breast <\s>
<s> the blood was running from it and he kept trying to stop it oh <\s>
<s> kit by kissing it she pauses stifled by emotion <\s>
<s> then i heard wreford laugh and say vultures didn't touch live bodies <\s>
<s> and there came a voice from somewhere calling out oh <\s>
<s> and wreford began to swear at it and i heard hubert say don't wreford let the poor fellow be <\s>
<s> but the voice went on and on moaning and crying out i'll lie here all night dying and then i'll die <\s>
<s> and wreford dragged himself along the ground his face all devilish like a man who's going to kill <\s>
<s> still that voice went on and i saw wreford take up the dead man's gun <\s>
<s> then hubert got upon his feet and went tottering along so feebly so dreadfully but before he could reach and stop him wreford fired at the man who was crying <\s>
<s> and hubert called out you brute <\s>
<s> and fell right down <\s>
<s> and when wreford saw him lying there he began to moan and sob but hubert never stirred <\s>
<s> then it all got black again and i could see a dark woman thing creeping first to the man without a head then to wreford then to hubert and it touched him and sprang away <\s>
<s> and it cried out a ai ah <\s>
<s> pointing out at the mist look <\s>
<s> putting her arms round her yes dear yes <\s>
<s> you must have been looking at the mist <\s>
<s> strangely calm he's dead <\s>
<s> it was only a dream <\s>
<s> you didn't hear that cry <\s>
<s> she listens that's stephen <\s>
<s> forgive me kit i oughtn't to have upset you but i couldn't help coming <\s>
<s> she goes out katherine into whom her emotion seems to have passed turns feverishly to the window throws it open and leans out <\s>
<s> catching sight of her figure in the window he goes quickly to her <\s>
<s> she has mastered her emotion more <\s>
<s> let me look at you <\s>
<s> he draws her from the window to the candle light and looks long at her <\s>
<s> what have you done to your hair <\s>
<s> he takes it greedily and buries his face in it katherine <\s>
<s> drawing her hair away well <\s>
<s> pointing to olive's room hssh <\s>
<s> katherine shrugs her shoulders more <\s>
<s> why have you come <\s>
<s> you begin again the day after tomorrow <\s>
<s> was it worth while <\s>
<s> it makes it harder for me that's all <\s>
<s> staring at her what's come to you <\s>
<s> six weeks is a long time to sit and read about your meetings <\s>
<s> put that away to night <\s>
<s> he touches her this is what travellers feel when they come out of the desert to water <\s>
<s> suddenly noticing the cut on his forehead your forehead <\s>
<s> let me bathe it <\s>
<s> turning away helen has just been telling me a dream she's had of hubert's death <\s>
<s> dream bad dreams and wait and hide oneself there's been nothing else to do <\s>
<s> with a movement of distress i see <\s>
<s> i thought from your letters you were coming to feel <\s>
<s> you look so lovely <\s>
<s> suddenly he sees that she is crying and goes quickly to her more <\s>
<s> my dear don't cry <\s>
<s> god knows i don't want to make things worse for you <\s>
<s> she draws away from him a little and after looking long at her he sits down at the dressing table and begins turning over the brushes and articles of toilet trying to find words <\s>
<s> after the time i've had i thought tonight it would be summer i thought it would be you and everything <\s>
<s> while he is speaking katherine has stolen closer <\s>
<s> she suddenly drops on her knees by his side and wraps his hand in her hair <\s>
<s> he turns and clasps her <\s>
<s> but to morrow it begins again <\s>
<s> how long how long am i to be torn in two <\s>
<s> drawing back in his arms i can't can't bear it <\s>
<s> pressing closer to him it shall be me and everything more <\s>
<s> it shall be if if more <\s>
<s> aghast you're not making terms <\s>
<s> for god's sake kit <\s>
<s> for god's sake stephen <\s>
<s> you of all people you <\s>
<s> for a moment more yields utterly then shrinks back more <\s>
<s> it's selling my soul <\s>
<s> he struggles out of her arms gets up and stands without speaking staring at her and wiping the sweat from his forehead <\s>
<s> katherine remains some seconds on her knees gazing up at him not realizing <\s>
<s> then her head droops she too gets up and stands apart with her wrapper drawn close round her <\s>
<s> it is as if a cold and deadly shame had come to them both <\s>
<s> quite suddenly more turns and without looking back feebly makes his way out of the room <\s>
<s> when he is gone katherine drops on her knees and remains there motionless huddled in her hair <\s>
<s> the curtain falls act iv it is between lights the following day in the dining room of more's house <\s>
<s> the windows are closed but curtains are not drawn <\s>
<s> steel is seated at the bureau writing a letter from more's dictation <\s>
<s> reading over the letter no doubt we shall have trouble <\s>
<s> but if the town authorities at the last minute forbid the use of the hall we'll hold the meeting in the open <\s>
<s> let bills be got out and an audience will collect in any case <\s>
<s> yours truly i've signed for you <\s>
<s> blotting and enveloping the letter you know the servants have all given notice except henry <\s>
<s> it's partly nerves of course the windows have been broken twice but it's partly more <\s>
<s> they'll do the next smashing themselves <\s>
<s> that reminds me to morrow you begin holiday steel <\s>
<s> last night ended your sulphur cure <\s>
<s> truly sorry ever to have let you in for it <\s>
<s> some one must do the work <\s>
<s> you're half dead as it is <\s>
<s> there's lots of kick in me <\s>
<s> give it up sir <\s>
<s> the odds are too great <\s>
<s> it isn't worth it <\s>
<s> to fight to a finish knowing you must be beaten is anything better worth it <\s>
<s> well then i'm not going <\s>
<s> this is my private hell steel you don't roast in it any longer <\s>
<s> believe me it's a great comfort to hurt no one but yourself <\s>
<s> i can't leave you sir <\s>
<s> my dear boy you're a brick but we've got off by a miracle so far and i can't have the responsibility of you any longer <\s>
<s> hand me over that correspondence about to morrow's meeting <\s>
<s> steel takes some papers from his pocket but does not hand them <\s>
<s> he stretches out his hand for the papers <\s>
<s> as steel still draws back he says more sharply give them to me steel <\s>
<s> steel hands them over now that ends it d'you see <\s>
<s> they stand looking at each other then steel very much upset turns and goes out of the room <\s>
<s> more who has watched him with a sorry smile puts the papers into a dispatch case <\s>
<s> as he is closing the bureau the footman henry enters announcing mr <\s>
<s> mendip comes in and the footman withdraws <\s>
<s> more turns to his visitor but does not hold out his hand <\s>
<s> taking more's hand give me credit for a little philosophy my friend <\s>
<s> more told me you'd be back to day <\s>
<s> there's been a victory <\s>
<s> so you actually are flesh and blood <\s>
<s> take off the martyr's shirt stephen <\s>
<s> you're only flouting human nature <\s>
<s> so even you defend the mob <\s>
<s> my dear fellow you're up against the strongest common instinct in the world <\s>
<s> what do you expect <\s>
<s> that the man in the street should be a quixote <\s>
<s> that his love of country should express itself in philosophic altruism <\s>
<s> what on earth do you expect <\s>
<s> men are very simple creatures and mob is just conglomerate essence of simple men <\s>
<s> mud of street and market place gathered in a torrent this blind howling patriotism what each man feels in here <\s>
<s> he touches his breast no <\s>
<s> you think men go beyond instinct they don't <\s>
<s> all they know is that something's hurting that image of themselves that they call country <\s>
<s> they just feel something big and religious and go it blind <\s>
<s> this used to be the country of free speech <\s>
<s> it used to be the country where a man was expected to hold to his faith <\s>
<s> there are limits to human nature stephen <\s>
<s> let no man stand to his guns in face of popular attack <\s>
<s> still your advice is it <\s>
<s> my advice is get out of town at once <\s>
<s> the torrent you speak of will be let loose the moment this news is out <\s>
<s> come my dear fellow don't stay here <\s>
<s> i'll see that katherine and olive go <\s>
<s> if your cause is lost that's no reason why you should be <\s>
<s> there's the comfort of not running away <\s>
<s> this is bad stephen bad foolish foolish <\s>
<s> i'm going to the house <\s>
<s> down the steps and through the gate <\s>
<s> katherine has come in followed by nurse hatted and cloaked with a small bag in her hand <\s>
<s> katherine takes from the bureau a cheque which she hands to the nurse <\s>
<s> more comes in from the terrace <\s>
<s> you're wise to go nurse <\s>
<s> you've treated my poor dear badly sir <\s>
<s> don't your own hearth and home come first <\s>
<s> your wife that was born in time of war with her own father fighting and her grandfather killed for his country <\s>
<s> a bitter thing to have the windows of her house broken and be pointed at by the boys in the street <\s>
<s> more stands silent under this attack looking at his wife katherine <\s>
<s> it's unnatural sir what you're doing <\s>
<s> to think more of those savages than of your own wife <\s>
<s> did you ever see her look like that <\s>
<s> take care sir before it's too late <\s>
<s> nurse stands for a moment doubtful looks long at katherine then goes <\s>
<s> quietly there has been a victory <\s>
<s> katherine is breathing fast listening to the distant hum and stir rising in the street <\s>
<s> she runs to the window as the footman henry entering says sir john julian ma'am <\s>
<s> sir john comes in a newspaper in his hand katherine <\s>
<s> he hands her the paper katherine <\s>
<s> she tears the paper open and feverishly reads katherine <\s>
<s> the distant hum in the street is rising steadily <\s>
<s> but sir john after the one exultant moment when he handed her the paper stares dumbly at the floor <\s>
<s> suddenly conscious of his gravity father <\s>
<s> there is other news <\s>
<s> one of the boys <\s>
<s> sir john bows his head katherine <\s>
<s> sir john again bows his head katherine <\s>
<s> she covers her face poor helen <\s>
<s> they stand for a few seconds silent then sir john raises his head and putting up a hand touches her wet cheek <\s>
<s> huskily whom the gods love katherine <\s>
<s> and hulks like me go on living <\s>
<s> but we shall drive the ruffians now <\s>
<s> we shall break them <\s>
<s> has he finished his blasphemous speech making at last <\s>
<s> katherine shakes her head not <\s>
<s> then seeing that katherine is quivering with emotion he strokes her hand sir john <\s>
<s> death is in many houses <\s>
<s> i must go to helen <\s>
<s> if you wish child <\s>
<s> she goes out leaving sir john to his grave puzzled grief and in a few seconds more comes in more <\s>
<s> by these whom you uphold <\s>
<s> katherine asked me to let you know <\s>
<s> she's gone to helen <\s>
<s> i understand you only came back last night from your  no word i can use would give what i feel about that <\s>
<s> i don't know how things stand now between you and katherine but i tell you this stephen you've tried her these last two months beyond what any woman ought to bear <\s>
<s> more makes a gesture of pain sir john <\s>
<s> when you chose your course more <\s>
<s> you placed yourself in opposition to every feeling in her <\s>
<s> you knew this might come <\s>
<s> it may come again with another of my sons <\s>
<s> i would willingly change places with any one of them <\s>
<s> yes i can believe in your unhappiness <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive of greater misery than to be arrayed against your country <\s>
<s> if i could have hubert back i would not have him at such a price no nor all my sons <\s>
<s> pro patri mori' my boy at all events is happy <\s>
<s> yet you can go on doing what you are <\s>
<s> what devil of pride has got into you stephen <\s>
<s> do you imagine i think myself better than the humblest private fighting out there <\s>
<s> not for a minute <\s>
<s> i don't understand you <\s>
<s> i always thought you devoted to katherine <\s>
<s> sir john you believe that country comes before wife and child <\s>
<s> bewildered whatever my country does or leaves undone i no more presume to judge her than i presume to judge my god <\s>
<s> with all the exaltation of the suffering he has undergone for her my country <\s>
<s> i would give all i have for that creed <\s>
<s> puzzled stephen i've never looked on you as a crank i always believed you sane and honest <\s>
<s> but this is visionary mania <\s>
<s> vision of what might be <\s>
<s> why can't you be content with what the grandest nation the grandest men on earth have found good enough for them <\s>
<s> i've known them i've seen what they could suffer for our country <\s>
<s> sir john imagine what the last two months have been to me <\s>
<s> to see people turn away in the street old friends pass me as if i were a wall <\s>
<s> to dread the post <\s>
<s> to go to bed every night with the sound of hooting in my ears <\s>
<s> to know that my name is never referred to without contempt sir john <\s>
<s> you have your new friends <\s>
<s> plenty of them i understand <\s>
<s> does that make up for being spat at as i was last night <\s>
<s> your battles are fool's play to it <\s>
<s> the stir and rustle of the crowd in the street grows louder <\s>
<s> sir john turns his head towards it <\s>
<s> you've heard there's been a victory <\s>
<s> do you carry your unnatural feeling so far as to be sorry for that <\s>
<s> more shakes his head that's something <\s>
<s> for god's sake stephen stop before it's gone past mending <\s>
<s> don't ruin your life with katherine <\s>
<s> hubert was her favourite brother you are backing those who killed him <\s>
<s> think what that means to her <\s>
<s> drop this mad quixotism idealism whatever you call it <\s>
<s> leave the country till the thing's over this country of yours that you're opposing and and traducing <\s>
<s> what good are you doing <\s>
<s> before you're utterly undone <\s>
<s> our men are dying out there for the faith that's in them <\s>
<s> i believe my faith the higher the better for mankind am i to slink away <\s>
<s> since i began this campaign i've found hundreds who've thanked me for taking this stand <\s>
<s> they look on me now as their leader <\s>
<s> am i to desert them <\s>
<s> when you led your forlorn hope did you ask yourself what good you were doing or whether you'd come through alive <\s>
<s> it's my forlorn hope not to betray those who are following me and not to help let die a fire a fire that's sacred not only now in this country but in all countries for all time <\s>
<s> after a long stare i give you credit for believing what you say <\s>
<s> but let me tell you whatever that fire you talk of i'm too old fashioned to grasp one fire you are letting die your wife's love <\s>
<s> this crew of your new friends this crew of cranks and jays if they can make up to you for the loss of her love of your career of all those who used to like and respect you so much the better for you <\s>
<s> but if you find yourself bankrupt of affection alone as the last man on earth if this business ends in your utter ruin and destruction as it must i shall not pity i cannot pity you <\s>
<s> he marches to the door opens it and goes out <\s>
<s> more is left standing perfectly still <\s>
<s> the stir and murmur of the street is growing all the time and slowly forces itself on his consciousness <\s>
<s> he goes to the bay window and looks out then rings the bell <\s>
<s> it is not answered and after turning up the lights he rings again <\s>
<s> she is wearing a black hat and black outdoor coat <\s>

<s> clearing his throat while we're waitin for lord william if you're interested in wine philosophically you can read the history of the times in this cellar <\s>
<s> take ock he points to a bin not a bottle gone <\s>

<s> i've regretted sometimes that i didn't have a shot at it myself influencin other people without disclosin your identity something very attractive about that <\s>
<s> lowering his voice between man and man now what do you think of the situation of the country these processions of the unemployed the red flag an the marsillaisy in the streets all this talk about an upheaval <\s>

<s> he will go far to meet you any day <\s>
<s> he is in full evening dress lord w <\s>
<s> cheerfully i say poulder what have you and james been doing to the press <\s>
<s> liberty of the press it isn't what it was but there is a limit <\s>

<s> dusting himself thanks it's only behind <\s>
<s> he opens his note book now lord william if you'd kindly outline your views on the national situation after such a narrow escape from death i feel they might have a moral effect <\s>
<s> my paper as you know is concerned with the deeper aspect of things <\s>
<s> by the way what do you value your house and collection at <\s>
<s> twisting his little mustache really i can't <\s>
<s> might i say a quarter of a million lifted in two seconds and a half hundred thousand to the second <\s>
<s> it brings it home you know <\s>
<s> no no dash it <\s>
<s> disappointed i see not draw attention to your property in the present excited state of public feeling <\s>
<s> well suppose we approach it from the viewpoint of the anti sweating dinner <\s>
<s> i have the list of guests very weighty <\s>
<s> taken some lifting wouldn't they <\s>
<s> seriously may i say that you designed the dinner to soften the tension at this crisis <\s>
<s> you saw that case i suppose this morning of the woman dying of starvation in bethnal green <\s>
<s> i've been horribly affected <\s>
<s> i always knew this slump would come after the war sooner or later <\s>
<s> you see i've been an anti sweating man for years and i thought if only we could come together now <\s>
<s> nodding i see i see <\s>
<s> get society interested in the sweated through the dinner <\s>
<s> i have the menu here <\s>
<s> he produces it lord w <\s>
<s> good god man more than that <\s>
<s> i want to show the people that we stand side by side with them as we did in the trenches <\s>
<s> the whole thing's too jolly awful <\s>
<s> i lie awake over it <\s>
<s> he walks up and down press <\s>
<s> scribbling one moment please <\s>
<s> i'll just get that down too jolly awful lies awake over it <\s>
<s> was wearing a white waistcoat with pearl buttons <\s>
<s> at a sign of resentment from his victim i want the human touch lord william it's everything in my paper <\s>
<s> what do you say about this attempt to bomb you <\s>
<s> well in a way i think it's d  d natural press <\s>
<s> scribbling lord william thought it d  d natural <\s>
<s> overhearing no no don't put that down <\s>
<s> what i mean is i should like to get hold of those fellows that are singing the marseillaise about the streets fellows that have been in the war real sports they are you know thorough good chaps at bottom and say to them have a feeling heart boys put yourself in my position <\s>
<s> i don't believe a bit they'd want to bomb me then <\s>
<s> he walks up and down press <\s>
<s> scribbling and muttering the idea of brotherhood d'you mind my saying that <\s>
<s> word brotherhood always effective always he writes lord e <\s>
<s> well it's pure accident that i'm here and they're there <\s>
<s> all the same i can't pretend to be starving <\s>
<s> can't go out into hyde park and stand on a tub can i <\s>
<s> but if i could only show them what i feel they're such good chaps poor devils <\s>
<s> he writes camel and needle's eye <\s>
<s> you were at eton and oxford <\s>
<s> your constituency i know <\s>
<s> but i can get all that <\s>
<s> is it your view that christianity is on the up grade lord william <\s>
<s> dubious what d'you mean by christianity loving kindness and that <\s>
<s> of course i think that dogma's got the knock <\s>
<s> writing lord william thought dogma had got the knock <\s>
<s> i should like you just to develop your definition of christianity <\s>
<s> loving kindness strikes rather a new note <\s>
<s> what about the sermon on the mount <\s>
<s> writing refers to sermon on mount <\s>
<s> i take it you don't belong to any church lord william <\s>
<s> exasperated well really i've been baptised and that sort of thing <\s>
<s> but look here press <\s>
<s> you can trust me i shan't say anything that you'll regret <\s>
<s> now do you consider that a religious revival would help to quiet the country <\s>
<s> well i think it would be a deuced good thing if everybody were a bit more kind <\s>
<s> musing i feel that your views are strikingly original lord william <\s>
<s> if you could just open out on them a little more <\s>
<s> how far would you apply kindness in practice <\s>
<s> can you apply it in theory <\s>
<s> i believe it is done <\s>
<s> but would you allow yourself to be blown up with impunity <\s>
<s> well that's a bit extreme <\s>
<s> but i quite sympathise with this chap <\s>
<s> imagine yourself in his shoes <\s>
<s> he sees a huge house all these bottles us swilling them down perhaps he's got a starving wife or consumptive kids <\s>
<s> writing and murmuring um m <\s>
<s> he thinks but for the grace of god there swill i <\s>
<s> why should that blighter have everything and i nothing <\s>
<s> writing and all that <\s>
<s> and gradually you see this contrast becomes an obsession with him <\s>
<s> there's got to be an example made he thinks and er he makes it don't you know <\s>
<s> and when you're the example <\s>
<s> well you feel a bit blue of course <\s>
<s> but my point is that you quite see it <\s>
<s> from the other world <\s>
<s> do you believe in a future life lord william <\s>
<s> the public took a lot of interest in the question if you remember at the time of the war <\s>
<s> it might revive at any moment if there's to be a revolution <\s>
<s> the wish is always father to the thought isn't it <\s>
<s> but er doesn't the question of a future life rather bear on your point about kindness <\s>
<s> if there isn't one why be kind <\s>
<s> well i should say one oughtn't to be kind for any motive that's self interest but just because one feels it don't you know <\s>
<s> writing vigorously that's very new very new <\s>
<s> simply you chaps are wonderful <\s>
<s> doubtfully you mean we're we're lord w <\s>
<s> you have such a d  d hard time <\s>
<s> it must be perfectly beastly to interview fellows like me <\s>
<s> not at all lord william <\s>
<s> i assure you compared with a literary man it's it's almost heavenly <\s>
<s> you must have a wonderful knowledge of things <\s>
<s> bridling a little well i shouldn't say that <\s>
<s> i don't see how you can avoid it <\s>
<s> you turn your hands to everything <\s>
<s> i say is there really going to be a revolution or are you making it up you press <\s>
<s> we never know whether we come before the event or it comes before us <\s>
<s> d'you mind lending me your note book a moment <\s>
<s> i'd like to stick that down <\s>
<s> all right i'll use the other end <\s>
<s> the press hands it hypnotically lord w <\s>
<s> now what's your real opinion of the situation <\s>
<s> as a man or a press man <\s>
<s> is there any difference <\s>
<s> is there any connection <\s>
<s> well as a man <\s>
<s> as a man i think it's rotten <\s>
<s> and as a pressman <\s>
<s> like a stilton cheese <\s>
<s> he is about to write press <\s>
<s> my stunt lord william <\s>
<s> he jots it on his cuff lord w <\s>
<s> would you say that a strong press movement would help to quiet the country <\s>
<s> well as you ask me lord william i'll tell you <\s>
<s> no newspapers for a month would do the trick <\s>
<s> yes but i should starve <\s>
<s> he suddenly looks up and his eyes like gimlets bore their way into lord william's pleasant troubled face lord william you could do me a real kindness <\s>
<s> authorise me to go and interview the fellow who left the bomb here i've got his address <\s>
<s> i promise you to do it most discreetly <\s>
<s> fact is well i'm in low water <\s>
<s> since the war we simply can't get sensation enough for the new taste <\s>
<s> now if i could have an article headed bombed and bomber sort of double interview you know it'd very likely set me on my legs again <\s>
<s> he holds out his frayed wristbands lord w <\s>
<s> grasping his hand my dear chap certainly <\s>
<s> go and interview this blighter and then bring him round here <\s>
<s> you can do that for one <\s>
<s> i'd very much like to see him as a matter of fact <\s>
<s> thanks awfully i shall never forget it <\s>
<s> might i have my note book <\s>
<s> lord william hands it back lord w <\s>
<s> and look here if there's anything when a fellow's fortunate and another's not he puts his hand into his breast pocket press <\s>
<s> but you see i shall have to write you up a bit lord william <\s>
<s> the old aristocracy you know what the public still expects if you were to lend me money you might feel lord w <\s>
<s> never should have dreamt press <\s>
<s> but it wouldn't do <\s>
<s> have you a photograph of yourself <\s>
<s> by the way has it occurred to you that there may be another bomb on the premises <\s>
<s> i'll have a look <\s>
<s> he looks at his watch and begins hurriedly searching the bins bending down and going on his knees <\s>
<s> the press reverses the notebook again and sketches him press <\s>
<s> lord william examines the foundations of his house <\s>
<s> a voice calls bill <\s>
<s> the press snaps the note book to and looks up <\s>
<s> there where the communication trench runs in stands a tall and elegant woman in the extreme of evening dress with presence of mind lady william <\s>
<s> you'll find lord william oh <\s>

<s> that i'd been baptised but he promised not to put it down <\s>
<s> bill you are absurd <\s>

<s> i don't remember anything else except that it was quite natural we should be bombed don't you know <\s>
<s> why what harm have we done <\s>

<s> why do you want to <\s>
<s> out there one used to know what one's men felt <\s>

<s> with a sharp look oh <\s>
<s> he's a nice boy <\s>
<s> you know what a nice boy is don't you <\s>
<s> not in these days <\s>
<s> well i'll tell you <\s>
<s> in the first place he's not amorous <\s>
<s> well that's some comfort <\s>
<s> just a jolly good companion <\s>
<s> you don't suppose i confine myself to the home paddocks do you <\s>
<s> i'm naturally rangey father <\s>
<s> ironically you don't say so <\s>
<s> in the second place he doesn't like discipline <\s>
<s> he does seem attractive <\s>
<s> in the third place he bars his father <\s>
<s> is that essential to nice girls too <\s>
<s> with a twirl of his hair fish not <\s>
<s> fourthly he's got ideas <\s>
<s> for instance he thinks as i do hillcrist <\s>
<s> he thinks old people run the show too much <\s>
<s> he says they oughtn't to because they're so damtouchy <\s>
<s> are you damtouchy darling <\s>
<s> i don't know about touchy <\s>
<s> he says there'll be no world fit to live in till we get rid of the old <\s>
<s> we must make them climb a tall tree and shake them off it <\s>
<s> otherwise with the way they stand on each other's rights they'll spoil the garden for the young <\s>
<s> does his father agree <\s>
<s> rolf doesn't talk to him his mouth's too large <\s>
<s> have you ever seen it dodo <\s>
<s> it's considerable isn't it <\s>
<s> now yours is reticent darling <\s>
<s> rumpling his hair hillcrist <\s>
<s> it won't be in a minute <\s>
<s> do you realise that i've got gout <\s>
<s> how long have we been here dodo <\s>
<s> looking at his foot it has its drawbacks <\s>
<s> d'you think hornblower had a father <\s>
<s> i believe he was spontaneous <\s>
<s> but dodo why all this this attitude to the hornblowers <\s>
<s> she purses her lips and makes a gesture as of pushing persons away hillcrist <\s>
<s> that's only because we are as mother would say and they're not yet <\s>
<s> but why not let them be <\s>
<s> it takes generations to learn to live and let live jill <\s>
<s> people like that take an ell when you give them an inch <\s>
<s> but if you gave them the ell they wouldn't want the inch <\s>
<s> why should it all be such a skin game <\s>
<s> where do you get your lingo <\s>
<s> keep to the point dodo <\s>
<s> well jill all life's a struggle between people at different stages of development in different positions with different amounts of social influence and property <\s>
<s> and the only thing is to have rules of the game and keep them <\s>
<s> new people like the hornblowers haven't learnt those rules their only rule is to get all they can <\s>
<s> they're not half as bad as you think <\s>
<s> well when i sold hornblower longmeadow and the cottages i certainly found him all right <\s>
<s> all the same he's got the cloven hoof <\s>
<s> warming up his influence in deepwater is thoroughly bad those potteries of his are demoralising the whole atmosphere of the place is changing <\s>
<s> it was a thousand pities he ever came here and discovered that clay <\s>
<s> he's brought in the modern cutthroat spirit <\s>
<s> cut our throat spirit you mean <\s>
<s> what's your definition of a gentleman dodo <\s>
<s> uneasily can't describe only feel it <\s>
<s> well er i suppose you might say a man who keeps his form and doesn't let life scupper him out of his standards <\s>
<s> but suppose his standards are low <\s>
<s> with some earnestness i assume of course that he's honest and tolerant gentle to the weak and not self seeking <\s>
<s> but aren't we all dodo <\s>
<s> with a smile you <\s>
<s> yes too young to know <\s>
<s> nobody knows till they're under pretty heavy fire jill <\s>
<s> except of course mother <\s>
<s> how do you mean mother <\s>
<s> mother reminds me of england according to herself always right whatever she does <\s>
<s> your mother it perhaps the perfect woman <\s>
<s> that's what i was saying <\s>
<s> now no one could call you perfect dodo <\s>
<s> besides you've got gout <\s>
<s> yes and i want fellows <\s>
<s> crossing to the bell shall i tell you my definition of a gentleman <\s>
<s> a man who gives the hornblower his due <\s>
<s> she rings the bell and i think mother ought to call on them <\s>
<s> rolf says old hornblower resents it fearfully that she's never made a sign to chloe the three years she's been here <\s>
<s> i don't interfere with your mother in such matters <\s>
<s> she may go and call on the devil himself if she likes <\s>
<s> i know you're ever so much better than she is <\s>
<s> you do keep your prejudices out of your phiz <\s>
<s> but mother literally looks down her nose <\s>
<s> and she never forgives an h <\s>
<s> they'd get the hell from her if they took the hinch <\s>
<s> don't slime out of it dodo <\s>
<s> i say mother ought to call on the hornblowers <\s>
<s> my dear i always let people have the last word <\s>
<s> it makes them feel funny <\s>
<s> my foot enter fellows left fellows send into the village and get another bottle of this stuff <\s>
<s> she blow him a kiss and goes out at the window hillcrist <\s>

<s> i fancy i have had a twinge sir <\s>
<s> in my cork wrist sir <\s>

<s> haven't seen you for a long time <\s>
<s> what can i do <\s>
<s> he draws in foot and breath with a sharp hiss hillcrist <\s>
<s> in a down hearted voice we've had notice to quit sir <\s>
<s> got to be out this week <\s>
<s> well but when i sold longmeadow and the cottages it was on the express understanding that there was to be no disturbance of tenancies mrs <\s>
<s> yes sir but we've all got to go <\s>

<s> i know i want one for my cowman <\s>

<s> we been there thirty years and now we don't know what to do <\s>
<s> so i hope you'll excuse us coming round sir <\s>
<s> i should think so indeed <\s>
<s> he rises and limps across to the fireplace on his stick <\s>
<s> to himself the cloven hoof <\s>
<s> this is a breach of faith <\s>
<s> i'll write to him jackman <\s>
<s> i'd certainly never have sold if i'd known he was going to do this <\s>
<s> no sir i'm sure sir <\s>
<s> they do say it's to do with the potteries <\s>
<s> he wants the cottages for his workmen <\s>
<s> sharply that's all very well but he shouldn't have led me to suppose that he would make no change <\s>
<s> heavily they talk about his havin bought the centry to gut up more chimneys there and that's why he wants the cottages <\s>
<s> yes air it's such a pretty spot looks beautiful from here <\s>
<s> she looks out through the window loveliest spot in all deepwater i always say <\s>
<s> and your father owned it and his father before im <\s>
<s> it's a pity they ever sold it sir beggin your pardon hillcrist <\s>

<s> with a sort of indulgent contempt but he's from the north they say <\s>
<s> fellows has entered left hillcrist <\s>
<s> hillcrist if she'll come <\s>

<s> hornblower said he was comin on to see you sir <\s>
<s> so we thought we'd step along first <\s>
<s> i said to jackman mr <\s>
<s> hillcrist'll stand up for us i know <\s>
<s> he's a gentleman i said <\s>
<s> this man i said don't care for the neighbourhood or the people he don't care for anything so long as he makes his money and has his importance <\s>
<s> you can't expect it i suppose i said bitterly havin got rich so sudden <\s>
<s> the gentry don't do things like that <\s>
<s> to himself the centry <\s>
<s> a well dressed woman with a firm clear cut face oh <\s>
<s> jackman turned out of their cottage and mrs <\s>
<s> harvey and the drews <\s>
<s> when i sold to hornblower i stipulated that they shouldn't be <\s>
<s> our week's up on saturday ma'am and i'm sure i don't know where we shall turn because of course jackman must be near his work and i shall lose me washin if we have to go far <\s>
<s> with decision you leave it to me mrs <\s>
<s> sorry i can't move with this gout <\s>
<s> for them both i'm sure we're very sorry sir <\s>
<s> good morning ma'am and thank you kindly <\s>
<s> they go out hillcrist <\s>
<s> turning people out that have been there thirty years <\s>
<s> i won't have it <\s>
<s> it's a breach of faith <\s>
<s> do you suppose this hornblower will care two straws about that jack <\s>
<s> he must when it's put to him if he's got any decent feeling <\s>
<s> suddenly the jackmans talk of his having bought the centry to put up more chimneys <\s>
<s> at the window looking out impossible <\s>
<s> it would ruin the place utterly besides cutting us off from the duke's <\s>
<s> miss mullins would never sell behind our backs <\s>
<s> anyway i must stop his turning these people out <\s>
<s> with a little smile almost contemptuous you might have known he'd do something of the sort <\s>
<s> you will imagine people are like yourself jack <\s>
<s> you always ought to make dawker have things in black and white <\s>
<s> i said quite distinctly of course you won't want to disturb the tenancies there's a great shortage of cottages <\s>
<s> hornblower told me as distinctly that he wouldn't <\s>
<s> what more do you want <\s>
<s> a man like that thinks of nothing but the short cut to his own way <\s>
<s> looking out of the window towards the rise if he buys the centry and puts up chimneys we simply couldn't stop here <\s>
<s> my father would turn in his grave <\s>
<s> it would have been more useful if he'd not dipped the estate and sold the centry <\s>

<s> miss mullins would never sell would she <\s>

<s> he won't stick at the price either <\s>
<s> what's it worth dawker <\s>
<s> depends on what you want it for <\s>
<s> he wants it for spite we want it for sentiment <\s>
<s> grinning worth what you like to give then but he's a rich man <\s>
<s> to hillcrist give me your figure sir <\s>

<s> how are ye dawker <\s>

<s> she is rather a handsome young woman with dark eyes full red lips and a suspicion of powder a little under dressed for the country <\s>
<s> rolf mho brings up the rear is about twenty with an open face and stiffish butter coloured hair <\s>
<s> jill runs over to her father at the window <\s>
<s> she has a bottle jill <\s>
<s> sotto voce look dodo i've brought the lot <\s>
<s> isn't it a treat dear papa <\s>
<s> and here's the stuff <\s>
<s> the exclamation is induced by the apprehension that there has been a row <\s>
<s> hillcrist gives a stiff little bow remaining where he is in the window <\s>
<s> jill stays close to him staring from one to the other then blocks him off and engages him in conversation <\s>
<s> charles has gone up to his father who has remained maliciously still where he delivered his last speech <\s>
<s> chloe and rolf stand awkwardly waiting between the fireplace and the door hornblower <\s>
<s> i'd practically got her to say she'd sell at three thousand five hundred when that fellow dawker turned up <\s>

<s> well if it's not gone we'll get it yet <\s>

<s> dawker if you don't mind dawker with a nod passes away out of the french window jill be respectful and don't talk like a bargee <\s>
<s> it's no good dodo <\s>

<s> it's just as as caddish to insult people who haven't said a word in your own house as it is to be old hornblower <\s>
<s> you don't know what you're talking about <\s>
<s> what's the matter with young mrs <\s>
<s> excuse me i shall keep my thoughts to myself at present <\s>
<s> she looks coldly at jill and goes out through the french window hillcrist <\s>
<s> you've thoroughly upset your mother jill <\s>
<s> it's something dawker's told her i saw them <\s>
<s> i don't like dawker father he's so common <\s>

<s> shaking her clubbed hair they'll make you do things you don't approve of dodo if you don't look out <\s>
<s> mother's fearfully bitter when she gets her knife in <\s>
<s> if old hornblower's disgusting it's no reason we should be <\s>
<s> so you think i'm capable that's nice jill <\s>
<s> i only want to warn you solemnly that mother'll tell you you're fighting fair no matter what she and dawker do <\s>
<s> smiling jill i don't think i ever saw you so serious <\s>
<s> because she swallows a lump in her throat well i was just beginning to enjoy myself and now everything's going to be bitter and beastly with mother in that mood <\s>
<s> that horrible old man <\s>
<s> don't let them make you horrid <\s>
<s> you're such a darling <\s>
<s> how's your gout ducky <\s>
<s> it's going to be half interesting for you but not for us <\s>
<s> look here jill is there anything between you and young what's his name rolf <\s>
<s> biting her lip no <\s>
<s> but now it's all spoiled <\s>
<s> you can't expect me to regret that <\s>
<s> i don't mean any tosh about love's young dream but i do like being friends <\s>
<s> i want to enjoy things dodo and you can't do that when everybody's on the hate <\s>
<s> you're going to wallow in it and so shall i oh <\s>
<s> i know i shall we shall all wallow and think of nothing but one for his nob <\s>
<s> aren't you fond of your home <\s>
<s> well you won't be able to live in it unless we stop that ruffian <\s>
<s> chimneys and smoke the trees cut down piles of pots <\s>
<s> every kind of abomination <\s>
<s> he points through the french window as if he could see those chimneys rising and marring the beauty of the fields i was born here and my father and his and his and his <\s>
<s> they loved those fields and those old trees <\s>
<s> and this barbarian with his improvement schemes forsooth <\s>
<s> i learned to ride in the centry meadows prettiest spring meadows in the world i've climbed every tree there <\s>
<s> why my father ever sold <\s>

<s> i'm not going to have it spoiled without a fight <\s>
<s> conscious of batting betrayed sentiment he walks out at the french window passing away to the right <\s>
<s> jill following to the window looks <\s>
<s> then throwing back her head she clasps her hands behind it jill <\s>
<s> a voice behind her says jill <\s>
<s> she turns and starts back leaning against the right lintel of the window <\s>
<s> rolf appears outside the window from left who goes there <\s>
<s> buttressed against the left lintel enemy after chloe's bag <\s>
<s> rolf passes through the window and retrieves the vanity bag from the floor where chloe dropped it then again takes his stand against the left lintel of the french window rolf <\s>
<s> it's not going to make any difference is it <\s>
<s> you know it is <\s>
<s> sins of the fathers <\s>

<s> none in a way only i've often told you i don't see why you should treat us as outsiders <\s>
<s> we don't like it <\s>
<s> well you shouldn't be then i mean he shouldn't be <\s>
<s> father's just as human as your father he's wrapped up in us and all his getting on is for us <\s>
<s> would you like to be treated as your mother treated chloe <\s>
<s> your mother's set the stroke for the other big wigs about here nobody calls on chloe <\s>
<s> i think it's contemptible to bar people just because they're new as you call it and have to make their position instead of having it left them <\s>
<s> it's not because they're new it's because if your father behaved like a gentleman he'd be treated like one <\s>
<s> i don't believe it <\s>
<s> my father's a very able man he thinks he's entitled to have influence here <\s>
<s> well everybody tries to keep him down <\s>
<s> that makes him mad and more determined than ever to get his way <\s>
<s> you ought to be just jill <\s>
<s> besides what's it got to do with charlie and chloe <\s>
<s> it's pretty sickening for her <\s>
<s> father didn't expect people to call until charlie married but since jill <\s>
<s> i think it's all very petty <\s>

<s> before the battle let's shake hands <\s>
<s> they move from the lintels and grasp each other's hands in the centre of the french window curtain act ii scene i a billiard room in a provincial hotel where things are bought and sold <\s>

<s> his lids come down over his quick eyes till he can see you very sharply and you can hardly see that he can see you <\s>
<s> he can break into a smile at any moment which has no connection with him as it were <\s>
<s> by a certain hurt look however when bidding is slow he discloses that he is not merely an auctioneer but has in him elements of the human being <\s>
<s> he can wink with anyone and is dressed in a snug brown suit with a perfectly unbuttoned waistcoat a low turned down collar and small black and white sailor knot tie <\s>
<s> while he is settling his papers the hillcrists settle themselves tensely <\s>
<s> chloe has drunk her water and leaned back again with the smelling salts to her nose <\s>

<s> at least you'd like to be in a position to help him if you thought it necessary <\s>

<s> women like that are pretty tough jill don't judge her too much by your own feelings <\s>

<s> we shan't tell him <\s>
<s> can't you tell him something to put him back to thinking it's all right <\s>
<s> i've done him such a wrong <\s>
<s> i didn't realise till after i thought meeting him was just a piece of wonderful good luck after what i'd been through <\s>
<s> i'm not such a bad lot not really <\s>

<s> jill standing beside the chair strokes her shoulder <\s>
<s> hillcrist stands very still painfully biting at a finger you see my father went bankrupt and i was in a shop hillcrist <\s>
<s> soothingly and to prevent disclosures yes yes yes yes <\s>
<s> i never gave a man away or did anything i was ashamed of at least i mean i had to make my living in all sorts of ways and then i met charlie <\s>
<s> again she stopped from the quivering of her lips jill <\s>
<s> he thought i was respectable and that was such a relief you can't think so so i let him <\s>
<s> and after i married him you see i fell in love <\s>
<s> if i had before perhaps i wouldn't have dared only i don't know you never know do you <\s>

<s> dully i've been on hot bricks all this month ever since that day here <\s>
<s> i knew it was in the wind <\s>
<s> what gets in the wind never gets out <\s>

<s> her voice changes to resentment but i've paid for being a fool tisn't fun that sort of life i can tell you <\s>
<s> i'm not ashamed and repentant and all that <\s>
<s> if it wasn't for him <\s>
<s> i'm afraid he'll never forgive me it's such a disgrace for him and then to have his child <\s>
<s> being fond of him i feel it much worse than anything i ever felt and that's saying a good bit <\s>
<s> he simply mustn't find out <\s>
<s> that's it but it's started and he's bound to keep on because he knows there's something <\s>
<s> a man isn't going to be satisfied when there's something he suspects about his wife charlie wouldn't never <\s>

<s> dodo what can we say to put him clean off the scent <\s>
<s> catching at this straw you will <\s>
<s> you see i don't know what i'll do <\s>
<s> i've got soft being looked after he does love me <\s>
<s> and if he throws me off i'll go under that's all <\s>
<s> have you any suggestion <\s>
<s> eagerly the only thing is to tell him something positive something he'll believe that's not too bad like my having been a lady clerk with those people who came here and having been dismissed on suspicion of taking money <\s>
<s> i could get him to believe that wasn't true <\s>
<s> yes and it isn't that's splendid <\s>
<s> you'd be able to put such conviction into it <\s>
<s> don't you think so dodo <\s>
<s> and don't say i've been here will you <\s>
<s> you see he knows that his father has re sold that land to you that's what he can't make out that and my coming here this morning he knows something's being kept from him and he noticed that man with dawker yesterday <\s>
<s> and my maid's been spying on me <\s>

<s> he puts two and two together <\s>
<s> but i've told him there's nothing he need worry about nothing that's true <\s>
<s> i'm very honest and careful about money <\s>
<s> so he won't believe that about me and the old man wants to keep it from charlie i know <\s>
<s> that does seem the best way out <\s>
<s> with a touch of defiance i'm a true wife to him <\s>
<s> of course we know that <\s>
<s> it's all unspeakably sad <\s>
<s> deception's horribly against the grain but chloe <\s>
<s> eagerly when i deceived him i'd have deceived god himself i was so desperate <\s>

<s> to the fire courage <\s>

<s> curtain scene ii at out eleven o'clock the following night an wanda's room on the ground floor in soho <\s>
<s> in the light from one close shaded electric bulb the room is but dimly visible <\s>
<s> a dying fire burns on the left <\s>
<s> a curtained window in the centre of the back wall <\s>
<s> a door on the right <\s>
<s> the furniture is plush covered and commonplace with a kind of shabby smartness <\s>
<s> a couch without back or arms stands aslant between window and fire <\s>
<s> on this wanda is sitting her knees drawn up under her staring at the embers <\s>
<s> she has on only her nightgown and a wrapper over it her bare feet are thrust into slippers <\s>
<s> her hands are crossed and pressed over her breast <\s>
<s> she starts and looks up listening <\s>
<s> her eyes are candid and startled her face alabaster pale and its pale brown hair short and square cut curls towards her bare neck <\s>
<s> the startled dark eyes and the faint rose of her lips are like colour staining on a white mask footsteps as of a policeman very measured pass on the pavement outside and die away <\s>
<s> she gets up and steals to the window draws one curtain aside so that a chink of the night is seen <\s>
<s> she opens the curtain wider till the shape of a bare witch like tree becomes visible in the open space of the little square on the far side of the road <\s>
<s> the footsteps are heard once more coming nearer <\s>
<s> wanda closes the curtains and cranes back <\s>
<s> they pass and die again <\s>
<s> she moves away and looking down at the floor between door and couch as though seeing something there shudders covers her eyes goes back to the couch and down again just as before to stare at the embers <\s>
<s> again she is startled by noise of the outer door being opened <\s>
<s> she springs up runs and turns the light by a switch close to the door <\s>
<s> by the glimmer of the fire she can just be seen standing by the dark window curtains listening <\s>
<s> there comes the sound of subdued knocking on her door <\s>
<s> she stands in breathless terror <\s>
<s> the knocking is repeated <\s>
<s> the sound of a latchkey in the door is heard <\s>
<s> her terror leaves her <\s>
<s> the door opens a man enters in a dark fur overcoat wanda <\s>
<s> in a voice of breathless relief with a rather foreign accent oh <\s>
<s> why did you knock <\s>
<s> i was so frightened <\s>
<s> she crosses quickly and flings her arms round his neck recoiling in a terror stricken whisper oh <\s>
<s> in a smothered voice a friend of larry's <\s>
<s> she has recoiled again to the window and when he finds the switch and turns the light up she is seen standing there holding her dark wrapper up to her throat so that her face has an uncanny look of being detached from the body <\s>
<s> gently you needn't be afraid <\s>
<s> i haven't come to do you harm quite the contrary <\s>
<s> holding up the keys larry wouldn't have given me these would he if he hadn't trusted me <\s>
<s> wanda does not move staring like a spirit startled out of the flesh <\s>
<s> after looking round him i'm sorry to have startled you <\s>
<s> in a whisper who are you please <\s>
<s> wanda with a sigh of utter relief steals forward to the couch and sinks down <\s>
<s> keith goes up to her <\s>
<s> clasping her hands round her knees yes <\s>
<s> staring round him again in this room <\s>
<s> just where you are standing <\s>
<s> i see him now always falling <\s>

<s> i don't know if i was really <\s>
<s> we went to an office and signed our names but he was a wicked man <\s>
<s> he treated many i think like me <\s>

<s> and that man first went for him <\s>
<s> i saw the mark <\s>

<s> i am so afraid for him <\s>
<s> checking her emotion look at me <\s>
<s> she looks at him if the worst comes and this man is traced to you can you trust yourself not to give larry away <\s>

<s> looking up into his face but you will be kind <\s>
<s> suddenly she bends and kisses his hand <\s>
<s> keith draws his hand away and she recoils a little humbly looking up at him again <\s>
<s> suddenly she stands rigid listening <\s>
<s> in a whisper listen <\s>
<s> she darts past him and turns out the light <\s>
<s> there is a knock on the door <\s>
<s> they are now close together between door and window <\s>
<s> under his breath you said no one comes but larry <\s>

<s> better for him to get away and make a clean cut of it <\s>
<s> uttering a little moaning sound oh sir <\s>

<s> pausing in the deglutition of his eggs affably pardon me sir i'd like to have you tell me why you called that little bit of a feller herr ober <\s>

<s> i guess by your labels you'll be dutch <\s>
<s> do they read tolstoi in your country <\s>
<s> the dutch youth laughs american <\s>
<s> that is a very luminous answer <\s>
<s> man should himself express <\s>
<s> he must push he must be strong <\s>
<s> in america we believe in virility we like a man to expand <\s>
<s> but we believe in brotherhood too <\s>
<s> we draw the line at niggers but we aspire <\s>
<s> social barriers and distinctions we've not much use for <\s>
<s> do you feel a draught <\s>

<s> for example is it your opinion that we should kill off the weak and diseased and all that can't jump around <\s>
<s> looking from face to face they might be me <\s>
<s> the dutch youth laughs american <\s>
<s> reproving him with a look that's true humility <\s>
<s> now here's a proposition that brings it nearer the bone would you step out of your way to help them when it was liable to bring you trouble <\s>
<s> eager but wistful i'm afraid not <\s>

<s> in human nature i believe so far as i can see him no more <\s>
<s> now that pears to me kind o blasphemy <\s>
<s> i believe in heroism <\s>
<s> i opine there's not one of us settin around here that's not a hero give him the occasion <\s>
<s> do you believe that <\s>
<s> i judge a hero is just a person that'll help another at the expense of himself <\s>
<s> take that poor woman there <\s>
<s> well now she's a heroine i guess <\s>
<s> she would die for her baby any old time <\s>

<s> to the german i guess you don't know how good you are <\s>
<s> as the german is twisting up the ends of his moustache to the englishwoman i should like to have you express an opinion ma'am <\s>
<s> i beg your pardon <\s>
<s> the english are very humanitarian they have a very high sense of duty <\s>

<s> to the dutch youth i judge even in your little country they have that <\s>
<s> this is an epoch of equality and high toned ideals <\s>
<s> to the little man what is your nationality sir <\s>
<s> i'm afraid i'm nothing particular <\s>

<s> in it are seated the englishman and his wife opposite each other at the corridor end she with her face to the engine he with his back <\s>
<s> both are somewhat protected from the rest of the travellers by newspapers <\s>
<s> next to her sits the german and opposite him sits the american next the american in one window corner is seated the dutch youth the other window corner is taken by the german's bag <\s>
<s> the silence is only broken by the slight rushing noise of the train's progression and the crackling of the english newspapers <\s>
<s> turning to the dutch youth guess i'd like that window raised it's kind of chilly after that old run they gave us <\s>
<s> the dutch youth laughs and goes through the motions of raising the window <\s>
<s> the english regard the operation with uneasy irritation <\s>
<s> the german opens his bag which reposes on the corner seat next him and takes out a book american <\s>
<s> the germans are great readers <\s>
<s> i read most anything myself <\s>
<s> the german holds up the book so that the title may be read don quixote fine book <\s>
<s> we americans take considerable stock in old man quixote <\s>
<s> bit of a wild cat but we don't laugh at him <\s>
<s> dead as a sheep <\s>
<s> a good thing too <\s>
<s> in america we have still quite an amount of chivalry <\s>
<s> chivalry is nothing sentimentalisch <\s>
<s> in modern days no good <\s>
<s> a man must push he must pull <\s>
<s> but i judge your form of chivalry is sacrifice to the state <\s>
<s> we allow more freedom to the individual soul <\s>
<s> where there's something little and weak we feel it kind of noble to give up to it <\s>
<s> that way we feel elevated <\s>
<s> as he speaks there is seen in the corridor doorway the little man with the woman's baby still on his arm and the bundle held in the other hand <\s>

<s> and you haf got her bundle and her baby <\s>
<s> he cackles drily american <\s>
<s> i guess providence has played it pretty low down on you <\s>
<s> it's sure acted real mean <\s>
<s> the baby wails and the little man jigs it with a sort of gentle desperation looking apologetically from face to face <\s>

<s> maybe you'd better get off right smart and restore that baby <\s>

<s> gravely it's highly entertaining not for the baby <\s>
<s> what kind of an old baby is it anyway <\s>

<s> which end up is it <\s>
<s> i think the right end <\s>
<s> yes yes it is <\s>
<s> maybe you should hold it out of window a bit <\s>
<s> very excitable things babies <\s>
<s> touching her knee my dear <\s>

<s> it looks kind of over wrapped up <\s>
<s> maybe it had better be unbound <\s>
<s> i think you are very likely right colonel <\s>
<s> it might be a pity to unbind that baby <\s>
<s> i guess the lady should be consulted in this matter <\s>
<s> yes yes of course <\s>
<s> touching her let it be <\s>
<s> little beggar seems all right <\s>

<s> guess i'll go and smoke in the corridor <\s>
<s> as he goes out the little man looks very wistfully after him <\s>
<s> screwing up his mouth and nose he holds the baby away from him and wavers then rising he puts it on the seat opposite and goes through the motions of letting down the window <\s>
<s> having done so he looks at the baby who has begun to wail <\s>
<s> suddenly he raises his hands and clasps them like a child praying <\s>
<s> since however the baby does not stop wailing he hovers over it in indecision then picking it up sits down again to dandle it with his face turned toward the open window <\s>

<s> the cries come nearer hoarser more shrill and clamorous the empty moonlight outside seems suddenly crowded with figures footsteps voices and a fierce distant cheering <\s>

<s> stands in the centre of a pattern made by the fragments of the torn up notes staring out unto the moonlight seeing not this hated room and the hated square outside but a german orchard and herself a little girl plucking apples a big dog beside her and a hundred other pictures such as the drowning see <\s>
<s> then she sinks down on the floor lays her forehead on the dusty carpet and presses her body to it <\s>
<s> mechanically she sweeps together the scattered fragments of notes assembling them with the dust into a little pile as of fallen leaves and dabbling in it with her fingers while the tears run down her cheeks <\s>

<s> appearing through curtain right sir <\s>
<s> take your curtain down <\s>
<s> he descends the steps and seats himself next to frust <\s>
<s> the curtain goes down a woman's voice is heard singing very beautifully sullivan's song orpheus with his lute with his lute made trees and the mountain tops that freeze <\s>
<s> in the armchair the professor is yawning tall thin abstracted and slightly grizzled in the hair <\s>
<s> he has a pad of paper over his knee ink on the stool to his right and the encyclopedia volume on the stand to his left barricaded in fact by the article he is writing <\s>
<s> he is reading a page over to himself but the words are drowned in the sound of the song his wife is singing in the next room partly screened off by the curtain <\s>
<s> she finishes and stops <\s>
<s> his voice can then be heard conning the words of his article <\s>
<s> orpheus symbolized the voice of beauty the call of life luring us mortals with his song back from the graves we dig for ourselves <\s>
<s> probably the ancients realized this neither more nor less than we moderns <\s>
<s> mankind has not changed <\s>
<s> the civilized being still hides the faun and the dryad within its broadcloth and its silk <\s>
<s> and yet he stops with a dried up air rather impatiently go on my dear <\s>

<s> the voice of his wife begins again gets as far as made them sing and stops dead just as the professor's pen is beginning to scratch <\s>
<s> and suddenly drawing the curtain further aside she appears <\s>
<s> much younger than the professor pale very pretty of a botticellian type in face figure and in her clinging cream coloured frock <\s>
<s> she gazes at her abstracted husband then swiftly moves to the lintel of the open window and stands looking out the wife <\s>
<s> looking at him do you know that i have to repeat everything to you nowadays <\s>
<s> that i have to repeat prof <\s>

<s> startled my dear your song was helping me like anything to get the mood <\s>
<s> this paper is the very deuce to balance between the historical and the natural <\s>
<s> who wants the natural <\s>

<s> history may go hang they're all for tuppence coloured sentiment nowadays <\s>
<s> as if to herself is the spring sentiment <\s>
<s> i beg your pardon my dear i didn't catch <\s>
<s> as if against her will urged by some pent up force beauty beauty <\s>
<s> that's what i'm trying to say here <\s>
<s> the orpheus legend symbolizes to this day the call of beauty <\s>
<s> he takes up his pen while she continues to stare out at the moonlight <\s>
<s> i get so sleepy i wish you'd tell them to make the after dinner coffee twice as strong <\s>
<s> how does this strike you <\s>
<s> conning many renaissance pictures especially those of botticelli francesca and piero di cosimo were inspired by such legends as that of orpheus and we owe a tiny gem like raphael apollo and marsyas to the same pagan inspiration <\s>
<s> we owe it more than that rebellion against the dry as dust <\s>
<s> i might develop that we owe it our revolt against the academic or our disgust at big business and all the grossness of commercial success <\s>
<s> his voice peters out wife <\s>
<s> i said we owe it love <\s>
<s> but er with a dry smile i mustn't say that here hardly <\s>
<s> to herself and the moonlight orpheus with his lute <\s>
<s> most people think a lute is a sort of flute <\s>
<s> yawning heavily my dear if you're not going to sing again d'you mind sitting down <\s>
<s> i want to concentrate <\s>
<s> the christian virtues and the dew <\s>
<s> with a little dry laugh not bad <\s>
<s> the christian virtues and the dew <\s>

<s> that's why there's a message <\s>
<s> i must hop it <\s>
<s> from miss maud builder <\s>
<s> he nods turns and goes pulling the door to behind him <\s>
<s> annie stands baff for a moment <\s>
<s> she goes across to the bedroom on the right and soon returns with a suit of pyjamas a toothbrush a pair of slippers and a case of razors which she puts on the table and disappears into the kitchen <\s>
<s> she reappears with a bread pan which she deposits in the centre of the room then crosses again to the bedroom and once more reappears with a clothes brush two hair brushes and a norfolk jacket <\s>
<s> as she stuffs all these into the bread pan and bears it back into the kitchen there is the sound of a car driving up and stopping <\s>
<s> annie reappears at the kitchen door just as the knocker sounds <\s>
<s> she opens the door oh <\s>
<s> mr and mrs builder enter <\s>
<s> mr and mrs builder <\s>
<s> my good girl not oh <\s>

<s> he looks at her blushing face and panting figure pats her on the shoulder and says never mind don't be nervous <\s>
<s> is that all please sir <\s>
<s> with a side look at her husband and a faint smile yes you can go <\s>
<s> she turns and hurries out into the kitchen left <\s>
<s> builder gazes after her and mrs builder gazes at builder with her faint smile <\s>
<s> after the girl is gone quaint and dutch pretty little figure <\s>
<s> fancy athene preferring this to home <\s>
<s> i didn't say anything <\s>
<s> placing a chair for his wife and sitting down himself well we must wait i suppose <\s>
<s> confound that nixon legacy <\s>
<s> if athene hadn't had that potty little legacy left her she couldn't have done this <\s>
<s> well i daresay it's all spent by now <\s>
<s> i made a mistake to lose my temper with her <\s>
<s> isn't it always a mistake to lose one's temper <\s>
<s> that's very nice and placid sort of thing you women who live sheltered lives can say <\s>
<s> i often wonder if you women realise the strain on a business man <\s>
<s> in her softly ironical voice it seems a shame to add the strain of family life <\s>
<s> you've always been so passive <\s>
<s> when i want a thing i've got to have it <\s>
<s> with a short laugh odd if you hadn't in twenty three years <\s>
<s> touching a canvas standing against the chair with his toe art <\s>
<s> we shall be having maud wanting to cut loose next <\s>
<s> still i oughtn't to have had that scene with athene <\s>
<s> i ought to have put quiet pressure <\s>
<s> what are you smiling at <\s>
<s> mrs builder shrugs her shoulders <\s>
<s> he examines the brand on the box strong very and not good <\s>
<s> he opens the door kitchen <\s>
<s> he shuts it crosses and opens the door right bedroom <\s>
<s> to his disappearing form do you think you ought john <\s>
<s> he has disappeared and she ends with an expressive movement of her hands a long sigh and a closing of her eyes <\s>
<s> builder's peremptory voice is heard julia <\s>
<s> she follows into the bedroom <\s>
<s> the maid annie puts her head out of the kitchen door she comes out a step as if to fly then at builder's voice shrinks back into the kitchen <\s>
<s> builder reappearing with a razor strop in one hand and a shaving brush in the other is followed by mrs builder <\s>
<s> getting between him and the kitchen door it's not dignified <\s>
<s> i don't care a damn <\s>
<s> athene has the tiny beginning of a moustache you know <\s>
<s> i shall stay and clear this up if i have to wait a week <\s>
<s> men who let their daughters <\s>
<s> this age is the limit <\s>
<s> he makes a vicious movement with the strop as though laying it across someone's back mrs builder <\s>
<s> she would never stand that <\s>
<s> even wives object nowadays <\s>
<s> grimly the war's upset everything <\s>
<s> women are utterly out of hand <\s>
<s> why the deuce doesn't she come <\s>
<s> suppose you leave me here to see her <\s>
<s> ominously this is my job <\s>
<s> i think it's more mine <\s>
<s> don't stand there opposing everything i say <\s>
<s> i'll go and have another look he is going towards the bedroom when the sound of a latchkey in the outer door arrests him <\s>
<s> he puts the strop and brush behind his back and adds in a low voice here she is <\s>
<s> mrs builder has approached him and they have both turned towards the opening door <\s>
<s> guy herringhame comes in <\s>
<s> they are a little out of his line of sight and he has shut the door before he sees them <\s>
<s> when he does his mouth falls open and his hand on to the knob of the door <\s>
<s> he is a comely young man in harris tweeds <\s>
<s> moreover he is smoking <\s>
<s> he would speak if he could but his surprise is too excessive <\s>
<s> recovering a little i was about to say the same to you sir <\s>
<s> very red from repression these rooms are not yours are they <\s>
<s> may i ask if you know whose they are <\s>
<s> will you kindly tell me why your sister signs her drawings by the name of my daughter athene builder and has a photograph of my wife hanging there <\s>
<s> the young man looks at mrs builder and winces but recovers himself <\s>
<s> boldly as a matter of fact this is my sister's studio she's in france and has a friend staying here <\s>
<s> and you have a key <\s>
<s> does your sister shave <\s>
<s> i i don't think so <\s>
<s> then perhaps you'll tell me what these mean <\s>
<s> he takes out the strop and shaving stick <\s>
<s> addressing mrs builder need we go into this in your presence ma'am <\s>
<s> it seems rather delicate <\s>
<s> what explanation have you got <\s>
<s> well you see builder <\s>
<s> no lies out with it <\s>
<s> with decision i prefer to say nothing <\s>
<s> do you live here <\s>
<s> guy makes no sign <\s>
<s> to guy i think you had better go <\s>
<s> julia will you leave me to manage this <\s>
<s> to guy when do you expect my daughter in <\s>
<s> quietly are you married to her <\s>
<s> that is no o not altogether i mean <\s>
<s> folding his arms i'm not going to say another word <\s>
<s> don't put your oar in <\s>
<s> i've had wonderful patience so far <\s>
<s> he puts his boot through a drawing art <\s>
<s> this is what comes of it <\s>
<s> are you an artist <\s>
<s> no a flying man <\s>
<s> the truth is builder <\s>
<s> i don't want to hear you speak the truth <\s>
<s> i'll wait for my daughter <\s>
<s> if you do i hope you'll be so very good as to be gentle <\s>
<s> if you get angry i might too and that would be awfully ugly <\s>
<s> i quite understand that sir <\s>
<s> but as a man of the world i hope you'll take a pull before she comes if you mean to stay <\s>
<s> if we mean to stay <\s>
<s> will you have a cigarette <\s>
<s> i i can't express guy <\s>
<s> soothingly don't try sir <\s>
<s> he jerks up his chin listening i think that's her <\s>
<s> goes to the door yes <\s>
<s> he opens the door your father and mother athene <\s>
<s> she is flushed and graceful <\s>
<s> twenty two with a short upper lip a straight nose dark hair and glowing eyes <\s>
<s> she wears bright colours and has a slow musical voice with a slight lisp <\s>
<s> how are you mother dear <\s>
<s> this is rather a surprise <\s>
<s> father always keeps his word so i certainly didn't expect him <\s>
<s> she looks steadfastly at builder but does not approach <\s>
<s> controlling himself with an effort now athene what's this <\s>
<s> the strop held out are you married to this this <\s>
<s> quietly to all intents and purposes <\s>
<s> father don't call names please <\s>
<s> why aren't you married to him <\s>
<s> do you want a lot of reasons or the real one <\s>
<s> mother dear will you go into the other room with guy <\s>
<s> she points to the door right <\s>
<s> because i would rather she didn't hear the reason <\s>
<s> to athene sotto voce he's not safe <\s>
<s> guy follows mrs builder and after hesitation at the door they go out into the bedroom <\s>
<s> well father if you want to know the real reason it's you <\s>
<s> what on earth do you mean <\s>
<s> guy wants to marry me <\s>
<s> in fact we but i had such a stunner of marriage from watching you at home that i builder <\s>
<s> my patience is at breaking point i warn you <\s>
<s> i'm perfectly serious father <\s>
<s> i tell you we meant to marry but so far i haven't been able to bring myself to it <\s>
<s> you never noticed how we children have watched you <\s>
<s> you and mother and other things all sorts of things builder <\s>
<s> taking out a handkerchief and wiping his brow i really think you're mad <\s>
<s> i'm sure you must dear <\s>
<s> what have you noticed <\s>
<s> d'you mean i'm not a good husband and father <\s>
<s> i suppose you can't now you're too used to her <\s>
<s> of course i'm used to her <\s>
<s> what else is marrying for <\s>
<s> that and the production of such as me <\s>
<s> and it isn't good enough father <\s>
<s> you shouldn't have set us such a perfect example <\s>
<s> you're talking the most arrant nonsense i ever heard <\s>
<s> he lifts his hands i've a good mind to shake it out of you <\s>
<s> shall i call guy <\s>
<s> he drops his hands <\s>
<s> confess that being a good husband and father has tried you terribly <\s>
<s> it has us you know <\s>
<s> taking refuge in sarcasm when you've quite done being funny perhaps you'll tell me why you've behaved like a common street flapper <\s>
<s> simply i couldn't bear to think of guy as a family man <\s>
<s> it's not his fault he's been awfully anxious to be one <\s>
<s> you've disgraced us then that's what it comes to <\s>
<s> i don't want to be unkind but you've brought it on yourself <\s>
<s> genuinely distracted i can't even get a glimmer of what you mean <\s>
<s> i've never been anything but firm <\s>
<s> i'm not an angel no ordinary healthy man is <\s>
<s> i've never grudged you girls any comfort or pleasure <\s>
<s> except wills of our own <\s>
<s> what do you want with wills of your own till you're married <\s>
<s> has she a will of her own <\s>
<s> sullenly she's learnt to know when i'm in the right <\s>
<s> i don't ever mean to learn to know when guy's in the right <\s>
<s> mother's forty one and twenty three years of that she's been your wife <\s>
<s> it's a long time father <\s>
<s> don't you ever look at her face <\s>
<s> troubled in a remote way rubbish <\s>
<s> i didn't want my face to get like that <\s>
<s> with such views about marriage what business had you to go near a man <\s>
<s> because i fell in love <\s>
<s> love leads to marriage and to nothing else but the streets <\s>
<s> what an example to your sister <\s>
<s> you don't know maud any more than you knew me <\s>
<s> she's got a will of her own too i can tell you <\s>
<s> now look here athene <\s>
<s> it's always been my way to face accomplished facts <\s>
<s> what's done can't be undone but it can be remedied <\s>
<s> you must marry this young  at once before it gets out <\s>
<s> he's behaved like a ruffian but by your own confession you've behaved worse <\s>
<s> you've been bitten by this modern disease this this utter lack of common decency <\s>
<s> there's an eternal order in certain things and marriage is one of them in fact it's the chief <\s>
<s> give me a promise and i'll try my utmost to forget the whole thing <\s>
<s> when we quarrelled father you said you didn't care what became of me <\s>
<s> so you are now <\s>
<s> come athene don't be childish <\s>
<s> with a little shudder no <\s>
<s> we were on the edge of it <\s>
<s> but now i've seen you again poor mother <\s>
<s> very angry this is simply blasphemous <\s>
<s> what do you mean by harping on your mother <\s>
<s> if you think that that she doesn't that she isn't athene <\s>
<s> i'm damned if i'll sit down under this injustice <\s>
<s> your mother is is pretty irritating i can tell you <\s>
<s> and and no blood in her <\s>
<s> aware that he has confirmed some thought in her that he had no intention of confirming what's that <\s>
<s> don't you ever look at your own face father <\s>
<s> when you shave for instance <\s>
<s> of course i do <\s>
<s> it isn't satisfied is it <\s>
<s> i don't know what on earth you mean <\s>
<s> you can't help it but you'd be ever so much happier if you were a mohammedan and two or three instead of one had had learned to know when you were in the right <\s>
<s> will you be quiet <\s>
<s> i don't ever want to feel sorry for guy in that way <\s>
<s> i think you're the most immodest i'm ashamed that you're my daughter <\s>
<s> if your another had ever carried on as you are now athene <\s>
<s> would you have been firm with her <\s>
<s> really sick at heart at this unwonted mockery which meets him at every turn be quiet you <\s>
<s> has mother never turned <\s>
<s> you're an unnatural girl <\s>
<s> go your own way to hell <\s>
<s> i am not coming back home father <\s>
<s> wrenching open the door right julia <\s>
<s> we can't stay here <\s>
<s> mrs builder comes forth followed by guy <\s>
<s> as for you sir if you start by allowing a woman to impose her crazy ideas about marriage on you all i can say is i despise you <\s>
<s> he crosses to the outer door followed by his wife <\s>
<s> to athene i've done with you <\s>
<s> mrs builder who has so far seemed to accompany him shuts the door quickly and remains in the studio <\s>
<s> she stands there with that faint smile on her face looking at the two young people <\s>
<s> awfully sorry mother but don't you see what a stunner father's given me <\s>
<s> my dear all men are not alike <\s>
<s> i've always told her that ma'am <\s>
<s> mother i'm so sorry for you <\s>
<s> the handle of the door is rattled a fist is beaten on it <\s>
<s> she stamps and covers her ears disgusting <\s>
<s> shaking her head i'm going in a moment <\s>
<s> to athene you owe it to me athene <\s>
<s> if somebody would give him a lesson <\s>
<s> have you ever tried mother <\s>
<s> mrs builder looks at the young man who turns away out of hearing <\s>
<s> i've always stood up to him in my own way <\s>
<s> the beating and rattling have recommenced and the voice are you coming <\s>
<s> passionately and that's family life <\s>
<s> father was all right before he married i expect <\s>
<s> and now it's like this <\s>
<s> he's only in a passion my dear <\s>
<s> it doesn't work otherwise athene <\s>
<s> a single loud bang on the door <\s>
<s> if he beats on that door again i shall scream <\s>
<s> mrs builder smiles shakes her head and turns to the door <\s>
<s> now my dear you're going to be sensible to please me <\s>
<s> if i say so it must be <\s>
<s> it's all comedy athene <\s>
<s> turning to them look here <\s>
<s> shall i shift him <\s>
<s> mrs builder shakes her head and opens the door <\s>
<s> builder stands there a furious figure <\s>
<s> will you come and leave that baggage and her cad <\s>
<s> mrs builder steps quickly out and the door is closed <\s>
<s> guy makes an angry movement towards it <\s>
<s> turning to her that puts the top hat on <\s>
<s> he takes out of his pocket a wedding ring and a marriage licence well <\s>
<s> what's to be done with these pretty things now <\s>
<s> you can't imagine i should ever be like that athene <\s>
<s> guy don't be horrid <\s>
<s> i feel awfully bad <\s>
<s> well what do you think i feel <\s>
<s> they turn to see annie in hat and coat with a suit case in her hand coming from the door left <\s>
<s> ma'am please miss i want to go home <\s>
<s> exasperated she wants to go home she wants to go home <\s>
<s> she moves across in front of them <\s>
<s> annie stops and turns to her <\s>
<s> what are you afraid of <\s>
<s> with comparative boldness i i might catch it miss <\s>
<s> no miss from you <\s>
<s> you see i've got a young man that wants to marry me <\s>
<s> and if i don't let him i might get into trouble meself <\s>
<s> what sort of father and mother have you got annie <\s>
<s> i never thought miss <\s>
<s> and of course i don't want to begin <\s>
<s> d'you mean you've never noticed how they treat each other <\s>
<s> i don't think they do miss <\s>
<s> father's an engine driver <\s>
<s> and what's your young man annie <\s>
<s> embarrassed somethin like you sir <\s>
<s> and suppose you marry him and he treats you like a piece of furniture <\s>
<s> i i could treat him the same miss <\s>
<s> don't you believe that annie <\s>
<s> that's because he wants you <\s>
<s> you wait till he doesn't <\s>
<s> annie looks at guy <\s>
<s> don't you believe her annie if he's decent annie <\s>
<s> suppressing a smile of course but the point is annie that marriage makes all the difference <\s>
<s> yes miss that's what i thought <\s>
<s> what i mean is that when once he's sure of you he may change completely <\s>
<s> slowly looking at her thumb oh <\s>
<s> i don't think he'll hammer me miss <\s>
<s> of course i know you can't tell till you've found out <\s>
<s> well i've no right to influence you <\s>
<s> no miss that's what i've been thinking <\s>
<s> you're quite right annie this is no place for you <\s>
<s> you see we can't be married sir till he gets his rise <\s>
<s> so it'll be a continual temptation to me <\s>
<s> well all right annie <\s>
<s> i hope you'll never regret it <\s>
<s> i say annie don't go away thinking evil of us we didn't realise you knew we weren't married <\s>
<s> we certainly did not <\s>
<s> i didn't think it right to take notice <\s>
<s> we beg your pardon <\s>
<s> only seein mr and mrs builder so upset brought it ome like <\s>
<s> and father can be andy with a strap <\s>
<s> what are you going to say to your people <\s>
<s> i shan't say i've been livin in a family that wasn't a family miss <\s>
<s> it wouldn't do no good <\s>
<s> well here are your wages <\s>

<s> good bye sir and thank you <\s>
<s> i was goin there now with my young man <\s>
<s> he's just round the corner <\s>
<s> be very careful of him <\s>
<s> yes sir i will <\s>
<s> so her father has a firm hand too <\s>
<s> but it takes her back to the nest <\s>
<s> playing with a leathern button on his coat if you'd watched it ever since you could watch anything seen it kill out all it's having power that does it <\s>
<s> i know father's got awfully good points <\s>
<s> well they don't stick out <\s>
<s> he works fearfully hard he's upright and plucky <\s>
<s> but he's smothered his animal nature and that's done it <\s>
<s> i don't want to see you smother anything guy <\s>
<s> gloomily i suppose one never knows what one's got under the lid <\s>
<s> if he hadn't come here to day he spins the wedding ring he certainly gives one pause <\s>
<s> used he to whack you <\s>
<s> with the best intentions <\s>
<s> you see he's a town councillor and a magistrate <\s>
<s> i suppose they have to be firm <\s>
<s> maud and i sneaked in once to listen to him <\s>
<s> there was a woman who came for protection from her husband <\s>
<s> if he'd known we were there he'd have had a fit <\s>
<s> did he give her the protection <\s>
<s> yes he gave her back to the husband <\s>
<s> with a grunt hang it <\s>
<s> we're not all like that <\s>
<s> twisting his button i think it's really a sense of property so deep that they don't know they've got it <\s>
<s> father can talk about freedom like a politician <\s>
<s> fitting the wedding ring on her finger well <\s>
<s> let's see how it looks anyway <\s>
<s> don't play with fire guy <\s>
<s> there's something in atavism darling there really is <\s>

<s> entering in confusion oh <\s>
<s> sir please sir i've told my young man <\s>
<s> well what does he say <\s>
<s> e was orrified miss <\s>
<s> the deuce he was <\s>

<s> yes sir but not so respectable as that <\s>
<s> well annie get your things off and lay lunch <\s>

<s> he holds out the marriage licence before her <\s>
<s> i don't know i don't know <\s>
<s> if it turned out guy <\s>
<s> must take chances in this life <\s>
<s> looking up into his face guy promise me solemnly that you'll never let me stand in your way or stand in mine <\s>
<s> they embrace athene quivers towards him <\s>
<s> they embrace fervently as annie enters with the bread pan <\s>
<s> it's all right annie <\s>
<s> there's only one more day's infection before you <\s>
<s> we're to be married to morrow morning <\s>
<s> won't mr builder be pleased <\s>
<s> that's not exactly our reason <\s>
<s> of course you can't be a family without can you <\s>
<s> what have you got in that thing <\s>
<s> annie is moving across with the bread pan <\s>
<s> she halts at the bedroom door <\s>
<s> please ma'am i was to give you a message very important from miss maud builder lookout <\s>
<s> act ii builder's study <\s>
<s> at the table maud has just put a sheet of paper into a typewriter <\s>
<s> she sits facing the audience with her hands stretched over the keys <\s>
<s> to herself i must get that expression <\s>
<s> her face assumes a furtive listening look <\s>
<s> then she gets up whisks to the mirror over the fireplace scrutinises the expression in it and going back to the table sits down again with hands outstretched above the keys and an accentuation of the expression <\s>
<s> the door up left is opened and topping appears <\s>
<s> he looks at maud who just turns her eyes <\s>
<s> lunch has been ready some time miss maud <\s>
<s> i don't want any lunch <\s>
<s> did you give it <\s>
<s> miss athene was out <\s>
<s> i gave the message to a young party <\s>
<s> she looked a bit green miss <\s>
<s> i hope nothing'll go wrong with the works <\s>
<s> shall i keep lunch back <\s>
<s> if something's gone wrong they won't have any appetite topping <\s>
<s> if you think i might risk it miss i'd like to slip round to my dentist <\s>
<s> he lays a finger on his cheek <\s>
<s> what race is being run this afternoon then topping <\s>
<s> twinkling and shifting his finger to the side of his nose well i don't suppose you've eard of it miss but as a matter of fact it's the cesarwitch <\s>
<s> only my shirt miss <\s>
<s> is it a good thing then <\s>
<s> i've seen worse roll up <\s>
<s> with a touch of enthusiasm dark horse miss maud at twenty to one <\s>
<s> put me ten bob on topping <\s>
<s> i want all the money i can get just now <\s>
<s> you're not the first miss <\s>
<s> i say topping do you know anything about the film <\s>
<s> nodding rather a specialty of mine miss <\s>
<s> well just stand there and give me your opinion of this <\s>
<s> topping moves down left <\s>
<s> she crouches over the typewriter lets her hands play on the keys stops assumes that listening furtive look listens again and lets her head go slowly round preceded by her eyes breaks it off and says what should you say i was <\s>
<s> then you think i've got it <\s>
<s> well of course i couldn't say just what sort of a crime you'd committed but i should think pretty ot stuff <\s>
<s> yes i've got them here <\s>
<s> she pats her chest <\s>
<s> there's just one point topping it's psychological <\s>
<s> should i naturally put my hand on them or would there be a reaction quick enough to stop me <\s>
<s> you see i'm alone and the point is whether the fear of being seen would stop me although i knew i couldn't be seen <\s>
<s> i think there's be a rehaction miss <\s>
<s> to touch them she clasps her chest is a bit obvious isn't it <\s>
<s> if the haudience knows you've got em there <\s>
<s> yes it's seen me put them <\s>
<s> look here i'll show you that too <\s>
<s> she opens an imaginary drawer takes out some bits of sealing wax and with every circumstance of stealth in face and hands conceals them in her bosom <\s>
<s> you have got a film face <\s>
<s> what are they if i may ask <\s>
<s> reproducing the sealing wax the fanshawe diamonds <\s>
<s> there's just one thing here too topping <\s>
<s> in real life which should i naturally do put them in here she touches her chest or in my bag <\s>
<s> touching his waistcoat earnestly well <\s>
<s> to put em in here miss i should say is more more pishchological <\s>
<s> subduing her lips yes but topping <\s>
<s> you see then you've got em on you <\s>
<s> but that's just the point <\s>
<s> shouldn't i naturally think safer in my bag then i can pretend somebody put them there <\s>
<s> you see nobody could put them on me <\s>
<s> well i should say that depends on your character <\s>
<s> of course i don't know what your character is <\s>
<s> no that's the beastly part of it the author doesn't either <\s>
<s> it's all left to me <\s>
<s> in that case i should please myself miss <\s>
<s> to put em in ere's warmer <\s>
<s> yes i think you're right <\s>
<s> i didn't know you ad a taste this way miss maud <\s>
<s> more than a taste topping a talent <\s>
<s> well in my belief we all have a vice about us somewhere <\s>
<s> but if i were you miss i wouldn't touch bettin not with this other on you <\s>
<s> you might get to feel a bit crowded <\s>
<s> well then only put the ten bob on if you're sure he's going to win <\s>

<s> i'll send you an address topping because i shan't be here <\s>

<s> by george ralph you may thank your stars you haven't got a delightful daughter <\s>
<s> yours are good decent girls <\s>
<s> athene's tremendously good and decent john <\s>
<s> i'd bet any money she's doing this on the highest principles <\s>

<s> don't twist my tail maud <\s>
<s> i had the most painful scene with athene this morning <\s>
<s> give up this silly notion <\s>
<s> it's really too childish <\s>
<s> looking at him curiously i've heard you say ever so many times that no man was any good who couldn't make his own way father <\s>
<s> well women are the same as men now <\s>
<s> it's the law of the country <\s>
<s> i only want to make my own way <\s>

<s> builder seizes her by the shoulders and shakes her vigorously <\s>

<s> with a yowl of pain you little devil <\s>

<s> if you knew what a prussian expression you've got <\s>
<s> builder passes his hand across his face uneasily as if to wipe something off <\s>
<s> are you my daughter or are you not <\s>
<s> i certainly never wanted to be <\s>
<s> i've always disliked you father ever since i was so high <\s>

<s> you don't really love anybody but yourself father <\s>

<s> i've often heard you talk about independence but it's a limited company and you've got all the shares <\s>
<s> rot only people who can support themselves have a right to independence <\s>
<s> that's why you don't want me to support myself <\s>
<s> you'd be in the gutter in a year <\s>
<s> athene's got her pittance but you you've got nothing <\s>

<s> well when i'm there i won't come to you to rescue me <\s>
<s> now mind if you leave my house i've done with you <\s>
<s> i'd rather scrub floors now than stay <\s>

<s> take your hat off and let's be friends <\s>
<s> maud looks at him and slowly takes off her hat <\s>
<s> relaxing his attitude with a sigh of relief that's right <\s>
<s> springing to the door leading to the hall good bye father <\s>
<s> at the sound of a bolt shot builder goes up to the window <\s>
<s> there is a fumbling at the door and camille appears <\s>
<s> what's the matter with that door <\s>

<s> i'm a family man <\s>
<s> but does it matter <\s>
<s> much beset look here you know <\s>

<s> look here i can't stand this you've got to go <\s>
<s> i've always kept a firm hand on myself and i'm not going to camille <\s>
<s> but i admire you so <\s>

<s> if you thought it a sin i might <\s>
<s> but you don't you're nothing but a a little heathen <\s>
<s> why should it be better if i thought it a sin <\s>
<s> then then i should know where i was <\s>
<s> as it is camille <\s>
<s> the english ave no idea of pleasure <\s>
<s> they make it all so coarse and virtuous <\s>
<s> now out you go before i <\s>

<s> i wanted to talk to you about maud <\s>
<s> she's she's actually gone and mrs builder <\s>
<s> i must tell you that i happened to look in a minute ago <\s>
<s> in absolute dismay you <\s>
<s> i will put no obstacle in the way of your pleasures <\s>
<s> aghast put no obstacle <\s>
<s> what do you mean <\s>
<s> julia how can you say a thing like that <\s>
<s> why i've only just mrs builder <\s>
<s> the girl fell on my knees <\s>
<s> she's she's a little devil <\s>
<s> i give you my word there's been nothing beyond a kiss under great provocation <\s>
<s> bows her head thank you <\s>
<s> but you must forgive my feeling it impossible to remain a wet blanket any longer <\s>
<s> because of a little thing like that all over in two minutes and i doing my utmost <\s>
<s> my dear john the fact that you had to do your utmost is quite enough <\s>
<s> i feel continually humiliated in your house and i want to leave it quite quietly without fuss of any kind <\s>
<s> julia this is awful it's absurd <\s>
<s> really your saying you don't mind what i do it's not right it's immoral <\s>
<s> i'm afraid you don't see what goes on in those who live with you <\s>
<s> so i'll just go <\s>
<s> now look here julia you can't mean this seriously <\s>
<s> think of my position <\s>
<s> you've never set yourself up against me before <\s>
<s> but i do now <\s>
<s> after staring at her i've given you no real reason <\s>
<s> i'll send the girl away <\s>
<s> you ought to thank me for resisting a temptation that most men would have yielded to <\s>
<s> after twenty three years of married life to kick up like this you ought to be ashamed of yourself <\s>
<s> i'm sure you must think so <\s>
<s> for heaven's sake don't be sarcastic <\s>
<s> you're my wife and there's an end of it you've no legal excuse <\s>
<s> d'you realise that you're encouraging me to go wrong <\s>
<s> that's a pretty thing for a wife to do <\s>
<s> you ought to keep your husband straight <\s>
<s> almost pathetically don't rile me julia <\s>
<s> i've had an awful day <\s>
<s> first athene then maud then that girl and now you <\s>
<s> all at once like this <\s>
<s> like a swarm of bees about one's head <\s>
<s> pleading come now julia don't be so so im practicable <\s>
<s> you'll make us the laughing stock of the whole town <\s>
<s> a man in my position and can't keep his own family it's preposterous <\s>

<s> i knew how it would be when we gave you the vote <\s>
<s> you and i are married and our daughters are our daughters <\s>

<s> you can tell people what you like <\s>
<s> i never heard anything so immoral in all my life from the mother of two grownup girls <\s>
<s> no wonder they've turned out as they have <\s>
<s> what is it you want for goodness sake <\s>
<s> we just want to be away from you that's all <\s>
<s> i assure you it's best <\s>
<s> when you've shown some consideration for our feelings and some real sign that we exist apart from you we could be friends again perhaps i don't know <\s>
<s> with one's own wife and daughters <\s>
<s> with great earnestness now look here julia you haven't lived with me all this time without knowing that i'm a man of strong passions i've been a faithful husband to you yes i have <\s>
<s> and that means resisting all sorts of temptations you know nothing of <\s>
<s> if you withdraw from my society i won't answer for the consequences <\s>
<s> in fact i can't have you withdrawing <\s>
<s> i'm not going to see myself going to the devil and losing the good opinion of everybody round me <\s>
<s> a bargain's a bargain <\s>
<s> and until i've broken my side of it and i tell you i haven't you've no business to break yours <\s>
<s> so now put all that out of your head <\s>
<s> intently d'you realise that i've supported you in luxury and comfort <\s>
<s> i think i've earned it <\s>
<s> and how do you propose to live <\s>
<s> i shan't give you a penny <\s>
<s> come julia don't be such an idiot <\s>

<s> seein i had his further arm twisted behind him <\s>
<s> mayor looking at builder any questions to ask him <\s>
<s> builder makes not the faintest sign and the mayor drops his glance <\s>
<s> moon steps back two paces and the sergeant steps two paces forward <\s>
<s> at ten minutes to four your worship yesterday afternoon constable moon brought the defendant to the station in a four wheeled cab <\s>
<s> on his recounting the circumstances of the assault they were taken down and read over to the defendant with the usual warning <\s>
<s> the defendant said nothing <\s>
<s> in view of the double assault and the condition of the constable's eye and in the absence of the superintendent i thought it my duty to retain the defendant for the night <\s>
<s> the defendant said nothing <\s>
<s> he as not opened his lips to my knowledge your worship from that hour to this <\s>
<s> any questions to ask the sergeant <\s>
<s> builder continues to stare at the mayor without a word <\s>
<s> the mayor and chantrey now consult each other inaudibly and the mayor nods <\s>
<s> miss maud builder will you tell us what you know of this er occurrence <\s>
<s> rising with eyes turning here and there must i <\s>
<s> i'm afraid you must <\s>
<s> after a look at her father who never turns his eyes from the mayor's face i i wish to withdraw the charge of striking me please <\s>
<s> i i never meant to make it <\s>
<s> i was in a temper i saw red <\s>
<s> very well that charge is withdrawn <\s>
<s> you do not appear to have been hurt and that seems to me quite proper <\s>
<s> now tell me what you know of the assault on the constable <\s>
<s> is his account correct <\s>
<s> tell us the truth <\s>
<s> resolutely only i don't think my father hit the constable <\s>
<s> i think the stick did that <\s>
<s> but er the stick was in is and wasn't it <\s>
<s> yes but i mean my father saw red and the constable saw red and the stick flew up between them and hit him in the eye <\s>
<s> and then he saw black <\s>
<s> with corrective severity but did e it im with the stick <\s>
<s> i don't think he did <\s>
<s> then who supplied the er momentum <\s>
<s> i think there was a struggle for the cane and it flew up <\s>
<s> hand up the cane <\s>
<s> the sergeant hands up the cane <\s>
<s> the mayor and chantrey examine it <\s>
<s> which end do you suggest inflicted this injury <\s>
<s> the knob end sir <\s>
<s> what do you say to that constable <\s>
<s> stepping the mechanical two paces i don't deny there was a struggle your worship but it's my impression i was it <\s>
<s> of course you were bit we can see that <\s>
<s> but with the cane or with the fist <\s>
<s> a little flurried i i with the fist sir <\s>
<s> will you swear to that <\s>
<s> with that sudden uncertainty which comes over the most honest in such circumstances not not so to speak in black and white your worship but that was my idea at the time <\s>
<s> you won't swear to it <\s>
<s> i'll swear he called me an idiot and a lout the words made a deep impression on me <\s>
<s> to himself mort aux vaches <\s>
<s> that'll do constable stand back <\s>
<s> now who else saw the struggle <\s>
<s> you're not obliged to say anything unless you like <\s>
<s> that's your privilege as his wife <\s>
<s> while he is speaking the door has been opened and harris has gone swiftly to it spoken to someone and returned <\s>
<s> he leans forward to the mayor <\s>
<s> mrs builder do you wish to give evidence <\s>
<s> rising no mr mayor <\s>
<s> to harris now then what is it <\s>
<s> harris says something in a low and concerned voice <\s>
<s> the mayor's face lengthens <\s>
<s> he leans to his right and consults chantrey who gives a faint and deprecating shrug <\s>
<s> this is an open court <\s>
<s> the press have the right to attend if they wish <\s>
<s> harris goes to the door and admits a young man in glasses of a pleasant appearance and indicates to him a chair at the back <\s>
<s> at this untimely happening builder's eyes have moved from side to side but now he regains his intent and bull like stare at his fellow justices <\s>
<s> to maud you can sit down miss builder <\s>
<s> maud resumes her seat <\s>
<s> miss athene builder you were present i think <\s>
<s> what do you say to this matter <\s>
<s> i didn't see anything very clearly but i think my sister's account is correct sir <\s>
<s> is it your impression that the cane inflicted the injury <\s>
<s> in a low voice yes <\s>
<s> with or without deliberate intent <\s>
<s> builder looks at her <\s>
<s> but you were not in a position to see very well <\s>
<s> your sister having withdrawn her charge we needn't go into that <\s>
<s> he motions her to sit down <\s>
<s> athene turning her eyes on her father's impassive figure sits <\s>
<s> now there was a young man <\s>
<s> pointing to herringhame is this the young man <\s>
<s> the moment is one of considerable tension <\s>
<s> with an effort at the moment sir i haven't one <\s>
<s> i've just left my diggings and haven't yet got any others <\s>
<s> how did you come to be present <\s>
<s> i er builder's eyes go round and rest on him for a moment <\s>
<s> it's in my sister's studio that miss athene builder is at present working sir <\s>
<s> i just happened to to turn up <\s>
<s> did you appear on the scene as the constable says during the struggle <\s>
<s> did he summon you to his aid <\s>
<s> miss maud builder did that <\s>
<s> what do you say to this blow <\s>
<s> jerking his chin up a little oh <\s>
<s> i saw that clearly <\s>
<s> well let us hear <\s>
<s> the constable's arm struck the cane violently and it flew up and landed him in the eye <\s>
<s> with a little grunt you are sure of that <\s>
<s> did you hear any language <\s>
<s> nothing out of the ordinary sir <\s>
<s> one or two damns and blasts <\s>
<s> you call that ordinary <\s>
<s> well he's a magistrate sir <\s>
<s> the mayor utters a profound grunt <\s>
<s> there is a silence <\s>
<s> then the mayor leans over to chantrey for a short colloquy <\s>
<s> did you witness any particular violence other than a resistance to arrest <\s>
<s> with a gesture of dismissal very well that seems to be the evidence <\s>
<s> defendant john builder what do you say to all this <\s>
<s> in a voice different from any we have heard from him say <\s>
<s> what business had he to touch me a magistrate <\s>
<s> i gave my daughter two taps with a cane in a private house for interfering with me for taking my wife home mayor <\s>
<s> that charge is not pressed and we can't go into the circumstances <\s>
<s> what do you wish to say about your conduct towards the constable <\s>
<s> in his throat not a damned thing <\s>
<s> embarrassed i i didn't catch <\s>
<s> nothing nothing he said mr mayor <\s>
<s> clearing his throat i understand then that you do not wish to offer any explanation <\s>
<s> i consider myself abominably treated and i refuse to say another word <\s>
<s> when you spoke of the defendant seeing red what exactly did you mean <\s>
<s> i mean that my father was so angry that he didn't know what he was doing <\s>
<s> would you say as angry as he er is now <\s>
<s> with a faint smile oh <\s>
<s> ralph builder stands up <\s>
<s> would you allow me to say a word mr mayor <\s>
<s> speaking of your own knowledge mr builder <\s>
<s> in regard to the state of my brother's mind yes mr mayor <\s>
<s> he was undoubtedly under great strain yesterday certain circumstances domestic and otherwise mayor <\s>
<s> you mean that he might have been as one might say beside himself <\s>
<s> had you seen your brother <\s>
<s> i had seen him shortly before this unhappy business <\s>
<s> the mayor nods and makes a gesture so that maud and ralph sit down then leaning over he confers in a low voice with chantrey <\s>
<s> the rest all sit or stand exactly as if each was the only person in the room except the journalist who is writing busily and rather obviously making a sketch of builder <\s>
<s> this young man mr herringhame i take it is a friend of the family's <\s>
<s> a moment of some tension <\s>
<s> n no mr mayor not of my father or mother <\s>
<s> an acquaintance of yours <\s>
<s> he clears his throat as the defendant wrongly we think refuses to offer his explanation of this matter the bench has to decide on the evidence as given <\s>
<s> there seems to be some discrepancy as to the blow which the constable undoubtedly received <\s>
<s> in view of this we incline to take the testimony of mr harris prompts him <\s>
<s> mr erringhame as the party least implicated personally in the affair and most likely to ave a cool and impartial view <\s>
<s> that evidence is to the effect that the blow was accidental <\s>
<s> there is no doubt however that the defendant used reprehensible language and offered some resistance to the constable in the execution of his duty <\s>
<s> evidence as been offered that he was in an excited state of mind and it is possible i don't say that this is any palliation but it is possible that he may have thought his position as magistrate made him er chantrey <\s>
<s> we think considering all the circumstances and the fact that he has spent a night in a cell that justice will be met by er discharging him with a caution <\s>
<s> with a deeply muttered the devil you do <\s>
<s> walks out of the room <\s>
<s> the journalist grabbing his pad starts up and follows <\s>
<s> the builders rise and huddle and with herringhame are ushered out by harris <\s>
<s> pulling out a large handkerchief and wiping his forehead my aunt <\s>
<s> these new constables mayor <\s>
<s> i say builder'll have to go <\s>
<s> damn the press how they nose everything out <\s>
<s> the great unpaid we shall get it again <\s>
<s> he suddenly goes off into a fit of laughter come off it i says to the best of my recollection <\s>
<s> i shan't hit a bird all day <\s>
<s> that poor devil builder <\s>
<s> it's no joke for him <\s>
<s> you did it well mayor you did it well <\s>
<s> british justice is safe in your hands <\s>
<s> he blacked the fellow's eye all right <\s>
<s> which i herewith produce <\s>
<s> it beats the band <\s>
<s> his uncontrollable laughter and the mayor's rueful appreciation are exchanged with lightning rapidity for a preternatural solemnity as the door opens admitting sergeant martin and the lugubrious object of their next attentions <\s>
<s> sergeant steps forward to read the charge as the curtain falls <\s>
<s> scene ii noon the same day <\s>
<s> topping is standing by the open window looking up and down the street <\s>
<s> a newspaper boy's voice is heard calling the first edition of his wares <\s>

<s> sucking in his cheeks well you see miss it's like this up to now mr builder's always had the respect of everybody maud moves her head impatiently <\s>

<s> well now he hasn't got it <\s>
<s> pishchologically that's bound to touch him <\s>
<s> of course but which way <\s>
<s> will he throw up the sponge or try and stick it out here <\s>
<s> he won't throw up the sponge miss more likely to squeeze it down the back of their necks <\s>
<s> he'll be asked to resign of course <\s>
<s> the newspaper boy's voice is heard again approaching first edition <\s>
<s> local magistrate before the bench <\s>
<s> i wish i hadn't <\s>
<s> but i couldn't see mother being topping <\s>
<s> don't you fret miss he'll come through <\s>
<s> his jaw's above his brow as you might say <\s>
<s> i rather follow that <\s>
<s> when the jaw's big and the brow is small it's a sign of character <\s>
<s> i always think the master might have been a scotchman except for his fishionomy <\s>
<s> so down on anything soft miss <\s>
<s> haven't you noticed whenever one of these umanitarians writes to the papers there's always a scotchman after him next morning <\s>
<s> seems to be a fact of uman nature like introducin rabbits into a new country and then weasels to get rid of em <\s>
<s> and then something to keep down the weasels <\s>
<s> but i never can see what could keep down a scotchman <\s>
<s> you seem to reach the hapex there <\s>
<s> miss athene was married this morning topping <\s>
<s> we've just come from the registrar's <\s>
<s> i thought perhaps she was about to be <\s>
<s> i saw the shadder yesterday <\s>
<s> well it's all right <\s>

<s> a cab is heard driving up <\s>
<s> that's them i expect <\s>

<s> at the window it is them <\s>
<s> topping goes out into the hall athene and ralph enter right <\s>
<s> where's father uncle ralph <\s>
<s> we left guy with mother at the studio <\s>
<s> she still thinks she ought to come <\s>
<s> she keeps on saying she must now father's in a hole <\s>
<s> i've got her things on the cab she ought to be perfectly free to choose <\s>
<s> you've got freedom on the brain maud <\s>
<s> so would you uncle ralph if you had father about <\s>
<s> i'm his partner my dear <\s>

<s> i've never yet given him in charge <\s>
<s> what do you do uncle ralph <\s>
<s> undermine him when i can <\s>
<s> and when you can't <\s>
<s> undermine the other fellow <\s>
<s> you can't go to those movie people now maud <\s>
<s> they'd star you as the celebrated maud builder who gave her father into custody <\s>
<s> come to us instead and have perfect freedom till all this blows over <\s>
<s> what will father be like now <\s>
<s> it's so queer you and he being brothers uncle ralph <\s>
<s> there are two sides to every coin my dear <\s>
<s> john's the head and i'm the tail <\s>
<s> he has the sterling qualities <\s>
<s> now you girls have got to smooth him down and make up to him <\s>
<s> you've tried him pretty high <\s>
<s> stubbornly i never wanted him for a father uncle <\s>
<s> they do wonderful things nowadays with inherited trouble <\s>
<s> come are you going to be nice to him both of you <\s>
<s> we're going to try <\s>
<s> i don't even now understand how it happened <\s>
<s> when you went out with guy it wasn't three minutes before he came <\s>
<s> mother had just told us about well about something beastly <\s>
<s> father wanted us to go and we agreed to go out for five minutes while he talked to mother <\s>
<s> we went and when we came back he told me to get a cab to take mother home <\s>
<s> poor mother stood there looking like a ghost and he began hunting and hauling her towards the door <\s>
<s> i saw red and instead of a cab i fetched that policeman <\s>
<s> of course father did black his eye <\s>
<s> you gave him the lead <\s>
<s> i couldn't help it seeing father standing there all dumb <\s>
<s> uncle why didn't you come back with guy <\s>
<s> why didn't you uncle <\s>
<s> when maud had gone for the cab i warned him not to use force <\s>
<s> i told him it was against the law but he only said the law be damned <\s>
<s> well it all sounds pretty undignified <\s>
<s> yes everybody saw red <\s>
<s> they have not seen the door opened from the hall and builder standing there <\s>
<s> he is still unshaven a little sunken in the face with a glum glowering expression <\s>
<s> he has a document in his hand <\s>
<s> he advances a step or two and they see him <\s>
<s> see them off the premises <\s>
<s> we thought you might like to know that athene's married and that i've given up the movies <\s>
<s> builder turns his back on them and sitting down at his writing table writes <\s>
<s> after a moment's whispered conversation with their uncle the two girls go out <\s>
<s> ralph builder stands gazing with whimsical commiseration at his brother's back <\s>
<s> as builder finishes writing he goes up and puts his hand on his brother's shoulder <\s>
<s> this is an awful jar old man <\s>
<s> here's what i've said to that fellow mr mayor you had the effrontery to day to discharge me with a caution forsooth your fellow magistrate <\s>
<s> i've consulted my solicitor as to whether an action will lie for false imprisonment <\s>
<s> i'm informed that it won't <\s>
<s> i take this opportunity of saying that justice in this town is a travesty <\s>
<s> i have no wish to be associated further with you or your fellows but you are vastly mistaken if you imagine that i shall resign my position on the bench or the town council yours john builder <\s>
<s> i say keep your sense of humour old boy <\s>
<s> i've spent a night in a cell <\s>
<s> he holds out the document it disinherits my family <\s>
<s> i've done with those two ladies <\s>
<s> as to my wife if she doesn't come back <\s>
<s> when i suffer i make others suffer <\s>
<s> julia's very upset my dear fellow we all are <\s>
<s> the girls came here to try and builder <\s>
<s> rising they may go to hell <\s>
<s> if that lousy mayor thinks i'm done with he's mistaken <\s>
<s> he rings the bell i don't want any soft sawder <\s>
<s> in a low voice the enemy stands within the gate old chap <\s>
<s> let's boss our own natures before we boss those of other people <\s>
<s> have a sleep on it john before you do anything <\s>
<s> i hadn't a wink last night <\s>
<s> if you'd passed the night i had ralph <\s>
<s> i hadn't many myself <\s>
<s> take this note to the mayor with my compliments and don't bring back an answer <\s>
<s> there's a gentleman from the comet in the hall sir <\s>
<s> would you see him for a minute he says <\s>
<s> tell him to go to a voice says mr builder <\s>
<s> builder turns to see the figure of the journalist in the hall doorway <\s>
<s> advancing with his card mr builder it's very good of you to see me <\s>
<s> i had the pleasure this morning i mean i tried to reach you when you left the mayor's <\s>
<s> i thought you would probably have your own side of this unfortunate matter <\s>
<s> we shall be glad to give it every prominence <\s>
<s> topping has withdrawn and ralph builder at the window stands listening <\s>
<s> drily regarding the journalist who has spoken in a pleasant and polite voice very good of you <\s>
<s> not at all sir <\s>
<s> we felt that you would almost certainly have good reasons of your own which would put the matter in quite a different light <\s>
<s> i should think so <\s>
<s> i tell you a very little more of this liberty licence i call it and there isn't a man who'll be able to call himself head of a family <\s>
<s> if the law thinks it can back up revolt it's damned well mistaken <\s>
<s> i struck my daughter i was in a passion as you would have been <\s>
<s> encouraging i'm sure builder <\s>
<s> glaring at him well i don't know that you would you look a soft sort but any man with any blood in him <\s>
<s> can one ask what she was doing sir <\s>
<s> we couldn't get that point quite clear <\s>
<s> i just had my arm round my wife trying to induce her to come home with me after a little family tiff and this girl came at me <\s>
<s> i lost my temper and tapped her with my cane <\s>
<s> and that policeman brought by my own daughter a policeman <\s>
<s> if the law is going to enter private houses and abrogate domestic authority where the hell shall we be <\s>
<s> encouraging no i'm sure i'm sure <\s>
<s> the maudlin sentimentality in these days is absolutely rotting this country <\s>
<s> a man can't be master in his own house can't require his wife to fulfil her duties can't attempt to control the conduct of his daughters without coming up against it and incurring odium <\s>
<s> a man can't control his employees he can't put his foot down on rebellion anywhere without a lot of humanitarians and licence lovers howling at him <\s>
<s> here am i a man who's always tried to do his duty in private life and public brought up before the bench my god <\s>
<s> because i was doing that duty with a little too much zeal perhaps i'm not an angel <\s>
<s> a proper englishman never is <\s>
<s> but there are no proper englishmen nowadays <\s>
<s> he crosses the room in his fervour <\s>
<s> suddenly as i look at faces builder <\s>
<s> i told this young man i wasn't an angel <\s>
<s> drawing him on yes sir i quite understand <\s>
<s> if the law thinks it can force me to be one of your weak kneed sentimentalists who let everybody do what they like ralph <\s>
<s> there are a good many who stand on their rights left john <\s>
<s> how can men stand on their rights left <\s>
<s> i'm afraid you had a painful experience sir <\s>
<s> every kind of humiliation <\s>
<s> i spent the night in a stinking cell <\s>
<s> i haven't eaten since breakfast yesterday <\s>
<s> did they think i was going to eat the muck they shoved in <\s>
<s> and all because in a moment of anger which i regret i regret i happened to strike my daughter who was interfering between me and my wife <\s>
<s> the thing would be funny if it weren't so disgusting <\s>
<s> a man's house used to be sanctuary <\s>
<s> what is it now <\s>
<s> with all the world poking their noses in <\s>
<s> he stands before the fire with his head bent excluding as it were his interviewer and all the world <\s>
<s> preparing to go thank you very much mr builder <\s>
<s> i'm sure i can do you justice <\s>
<s> would you like to see a proof <\s>
<s> half conscious of him what <\s>
<s> or will you trust me <\s>
<s> i wouldn't trust you a yard <\s>
<s> at the door very well sir you shall have a proof i promise <\s>
<s> good afternoon and thank you <\s>
<s> but he is gone and builder is left staring at his brother on whose face is still that look of whimsical commiseration <\s>
<s> take a pull old man <\s>
<s> have a hot bath and go to bed <\s>
<s> they've chosen to drive me to extremes now let them take the consequences <\s>
<s> i don't care a kick what anybody thinks <\s>
<s> sadly well i won't worry you anymore now <\s>
<s> with a nasty laugh no come again to morrow <\s>
<s> when you've had a sleep <\s>
<s> for the sake of the family name john don't be hasty <\s>
<s> shut the stable door <\s>
<s> no my boy the horse has gone <\s>
<s> with a lingering look at his brother who has sat down sullenly at the writing table he goes out into the hall <\s>
<s> builder remains staring in front of him <\s>
<s> the dining room door opens and camille's head is thrust in <\s>
<s> seeing him she draws back but he catches sight of her <\s>
<s> camille comes doubtfully up to the writing table <\s>
<s> her forehead is puckered as if she were thinking hard <\s>
<s> looking at her unsmiling so you want to be my mistress do you <\s>
<s> camille makes a nervous gesture <\s>
<s> not moving you f frighten me <\s>
<s> i've paid a pretty price for you <\s>
<s> but you'll make up for it you and others <\s>
<s> starting back no i don't like you to day <\s>
<s> she is just within reach and he seizes her arm all my married life i've put a curb on myself for the sake of respectability <\s>
<s> i've been a man of principle my girl as you saw yesterday <\s>
<s> well they don't want that <\s>
<s> he draws her close you can sit on my knee now <\s>
<s> shrinking no i don't want to to day <\s>
<s> they've asked for it <\s>
<s> with a supple movement slipping away from him they <\s>
<s> what is all that <\s>
<s> i don't want any trouble <\s>
<s> no no i am not taking any <\s>
<s> she moves back towards the door <\s>
<s> builder utters a sardonic laugh <\s>
<s> you are a dangerous man <\s>
<s> she turns swiftly and goes out <\s>
<s> builder again utters his glum laugh <\s>
<s> and then as he sits alone staring before him perfect silence reigns in the room <\s>
<s> over the window sill behind him a boy's face is seen to rise it hangs there a moment with a grin spreading on it <\s>
<s> as builder turns sharply it vanishes <\s>
<s> oo beat is wife <\s>
<s> builder rushes to the window <\s>
<s> more distant and a little tentative johnny builder <\s>
<s> if i catch you i'll wring your blasted little neck <\s>
<s> a little distant oo blacked the copper's eye <\s>
<s> builder in an ungovernable passion seizes a small flower pot from the sill and dings it with all his force <\s>
<s> the sound of a crash <\s>
<s> builder stands leaning out face injected with blood shaking his fist <\s>
<s> the curtain falls for a few seconds <\s>
<s> scene iii evening the same day <\s>
<s> builder's study is dim and neglected looking the window is still open though it has become night <\s>
<s> a street lamp outside shines in and the end of its rays fall on builder asleep <\s>
<s> he is sitting in a high chair at the fireside end of the writing table with his elbows on it and his cheek resting on his hand <\s>
<s> he is still unshaven and his clothes unchanged <\s>
<s> a boy's head appears above the level of the window sill as if beheaded and fastened there <\s>
<s> in a forceful whisper johnny builder <\s>
<s> the boy's head vanishes <\s>
<s> builder raising his other hand makes a sweep before his face as if to brush away a mosquito <\s>
<s> takes in remembrance and sits a moment staring gloomily before him <\s>
<s> the door from the hall is opened and topping comes in with a long envelope in his hand <\s>
<s> approaching from the comet sir <\s>
<s> proof of your interview sir will you please revise the messenger says he wants to take it back at once <\s>
<s> taking it all right <\s>
<s> shall i close in sir <\s>

<s> nearly a thousand nine hundred and seventy i think <\s>

<s> that weed dancy gave you in the spring <\s>
<s> but i tried her pretty high the other day and she's in the cambridgeshire <\s>

<s> not seeing the fine shade yes and had the key here <\s>
<s> he taps his pocket look here <\s>
<s> he holds out a pocket book it's been stuffed with my shaving papers <\s>
<s> between feeling that such things don't happen and a sense that he will have to clear it up this is damned awkward de levis <\s>

<s> it's the sort of thing that doesn't happen in a decent house <\s>
<s> are you sure you're not mistaken and didn't have them stolen on the course <\s>
<s> i counted them just before putting them under my pillow then i locked the door and had the key here <\s>
<s> there's only one door you know <\s>
<s> how was your window <\s>
<s> drawing back the curtains of his own window you've got a balcony like this <\s>

<s> who knew you'd got that money <\s>
<s> where did kentman pay you <\s>

<s> a knock from the corridor come in <\s>

<s> de levis gives him a quick hard look noted and resented by winsor <\s>
<s> to winsor yes sir <\s>
<s> who valets mr de levis <\s>
<s> when was he up last <\s>
<s> in the ordinary course of things about ten o'clock sir <\s>

<s> you didn't have them on you at dinner <\s>
<s> where did you put them <\s>
<s> in a boot and the boot in my suitcase and locked it <\s>
<s> again slightly outraged by such precautions in his house and you found it locked and took them from there to put under your pillow <\s>
<s> run your mind over things treisure has any stranger been about <\s>
<s> this seems to have happened between 11.15 and 11.30 <\s>
<s> de levis nods any noise anything outside anything suspicious anywhere <\s>
<s> running his mind very still no sir <\s>
<s> what time did you shut up <\s>
<s> i should say about eleven fifteen sir <\s>
<s> as soon as major colford and captain dancy had finished billiards <\s>
<s> what was mr de levis doing out of his room if i may ask sir <\s>
<s> having a bath with his room locked and the key in his pocket <\s>

<s> what do you mean <\s>
<s> i beg your pardon sir <\s>
<s> concealing a smile look here treisure it's infernally awkward for everybody <\s>
<s> what do you suggest <\s>
<s> the proper thing sir i suppose would be a cordon and a complete search in our interests <\s>
<s> i entirely refuse to suspect anybody <\s>
<s> but if mr de levis feels otherwise sir <\s>
<s> all i know is the money was there and it's gone <\s>
<s> it's pretty sickening for you <\s>

<s> however we must do our best to get it back for you <\s>
<s> a knock on the door <\s>
<s> treisure opens the door and general <\s>

<s> well general what's the first move <\s>
<s> lifting his eyebrows mr de levis presses the matter <\s>
<s> flicked again unless you think it's too plebeian of me general canynge a thousand pounds <\s>
<s> then we must wait for the police winsor <\s>
<s> lady adela has got through to them <\s>
<s> what height are these rooms from the ground treisure <\s>
<s> twenty three feet from the terrace sir <\s>
<s> one in the stables sir very heavy <\s>

<s> you had better leave this in our hands de levis <\s>
<s> certainly only the way he winsor <\s>
<s> curtly treisure has been here since he was a boy <\s>
<s> i should as soon suspect myself <\s>
<s> looking from one to the other with sudden anger you seem to think <\s>
<s> what was i to do <\s>
<s> take it lying down and let whoever it is get clear off <\s>
<s> i suppose it's natural to want my money back <\s>
<s> canynge looks at his nails winsor out of the window <\s>

<s> no but if we had <\s>
<s> come to you as he did <\s>

<s> we shouldn't have wanted the police <\s>

<s> right sir i've brought a man with me <\s>
<s> and interval of a minute <\s>
<s> scene ii the same set is used for this scene with the different arrangement of furniture as specified the bedroom of de levis is the same in shape as winsor's dressing room except that there is only one door to the corridor <\s>
<s> the furniture however is differently arranged a small four poster bedstead stands against the wall right back jutting into the room <\s>
<s> a chair on which de levis's clothes are thrown stands at its foot <\s>
<s> there is a dressing table against the wall to the left of the open windows where the curtains are drawn back and a stone balcony is seen <\s>

<s> on a small table to the right of the bed an electric reading lamp is turned up and there is a light over the dressing table <\s>

<s> winsor and canynge are close to the door right forward <\s>
<s> finishing a note now sir if this is the room as you left it for your bath just show us exactly what you did after takin the pocket book from the suit case <\s>

<s> we now have the room as it was when the theft was committed <\s>
<s> reconstruct accordin to uman nature gentlemen assumin the thief to be in the room what would he try first the clothes the dressin' table the suit case the chest of drawers and last the bed <\s>
<s> he moves accordingly examining the glass on the dressing table the surface of the suit cases and the handles of the drawers with a spy glass for finger marks <\s>
<s> sotto voce to winsor the order would have been just the other way <\s>
<s> the inspector goes on hands and knees and examines the carpet between the window and the bed <\s>
<s> can i come in again <\s>
<s> standing up did you open the window sir or was it open when you first came in <\s>
<s> drawin the curtains back first <\s>
<s> sharply are you sure there was nobody in the room already <\s>
<s> taken aback i don't know <\s>
<s> i didn't look under the bed if you mean that <\s>
<s> jotting did not look under bed <\s>
<s> did you look under it after the theft <\s>
<s> now what did you do after you came back from your bath <\s>
<s> just give us that precisely <\s>
<s> locked the door and left the key in <\s>
<s> put back my sponge and took off my dressing gown and put it there <\s>
<s> he points to the footrails of the bed then i drew the curtains again <\s>
<s> i got into bed felt for my watch to see the time <\s>
<s> my hand struck the pocket book and somehow it felt thinner <\s>
<s> i took it out looked into it and found the notes gone and these shaving papers instead <\s>

<s> with a certain finality now sir what time did you come up <\s>
<s> precise if you can give it me <\s>
<s> well i know it was eleven fifteen when i put my watch under my pillow before i went to the bath and i suppose i'd been about a quarter of an hour undressing <\s>
<s> i should say after eleven if anything <\s>
<s> didn't look over your bettin book <\s>
<s> no prayers or anything <\s>
<s> pretty slippy with your undressin as a rule <\s>
<s> say five past eleven <\s>
<s> mr winsor what time did the gentleman come to you <\s>
<s> how do you fix that sir <\s>
<s> i'd just looked at the time and told my wife to send her maid off <\s>
<s> then we've got it fixed between 11.15 and 11.30 <\s>
<s> jots now sir before we go further i'd like to see your butler and the footman that valets this gentleman <\s>
<s> with distaste very well inspector only my butler has been with us from a boy <\s>
<s> this is just clearing the ground sir <\s>
<s> general d'you mind touching that bell <\s>
<s> canynge rings a bell by the bed <\s>
<s> well gentlemen there are four possibilities <\s>
<s> either the thief was here all the time waiting under the bed and slipped out after this gentleman had gone to mr winsor <\s>
<s> or he came in with a key that fits the lock and i'll want to see all the keys in the house <\s>
<s> or he came in with a skeleton key and out by the window probably droppin from the balcony <\s>
<s> or he came in by the window with a rope or ladder and out the same way <\s>
<s> pointing there's a footmark here from a big boot which has been out of doors since it rained <\s>
<s> inspector you er walked up to the window when you first came into the room <\s>
<s> stiffly i had not overlooked that general <\s>
<s> a knock on the door relieves a certain tension winsor <\s>
<s> the footman robert a fresh faced young man enters followed by treisure <\s>
<s> you valet mr mr de levis i think <\s>
<s> at what time did you take his clothes and boots <\s>
<s> with a pounce did you happen to look under his bed <\s>
<s> did you come up again to bring the clothes back <\s>
<s> no sir they're still downstairs <\s>
<s> did you come up again for anything <\s>
<s> what time did you go to bed <\s>
<s> just after eleven sir <\s>
<s> scrutinising him now be careful <\s>
<s> did you go to bed at all <\s>
<s> then why did you say you did <\s>
<s> there's been a theft here and anything you say may be used against you <\s>
<s> i meant i went to my room <\s>
<s> where is your room <\s>
<s> on the ground floor at the other end of the right wing sir <\s>
<s> it's the extreme end of the house from this inspector <\s>
<s> he's with the other two footmen <\s>
<s> were you there alone <\s>
<s> thomas and frederick was there too <\s>
<s> that's right i've seen them <\s>
<s> holding up his hand for silence were you out of the room again after you went in <\s>
<s> what were you doing if you didn't go to bed <\s>
<s> to winsor beggin your pardon sir we were playin bridge <\s>
<s> i'll see them later on <\s>
<s> they'll say the same as me <\s>
<s> he goes out leaving a smile on the face of all except the inspector and de levis <\s>
<s> sharply call him back <\s>
<s> treisure calls robert and the footman re enters <\s>
<s> did you notice anything particular about mr de levis's clothes <\s>
<s> only that they were very good sir <\s>
<s> after reflection yes sir <\s>
<s> a pair of his boots this evenin was reduced to one sir <\s>
<s> what did you make of that <\s>
<s> i thought he might have thrown the other at a cat or something <\s>
<s> did you look for it <\s>
<s> no sir i meant to draw his attention to it in the morning <\s>
<s> he goes again inspector <\s>
<s> looking at de levis well sir there's your story corroborated <\s>
<s> stifly i don't know why it should need corroboration inspector <\s>
<s> in my experience you can never have too much of that <\s>
<s> to winsor i understand there's a lady in the room on this side pointing left and a gentleman on this pointing right were they in their rooms <\s>
<s> miss orme was captain dancy not <\s>
<s> do they know of the affair <\s>
<s> well i'd just like the keys of their doors for a minute <\s>
<s> my man will get them <\s>
<s> he goes to the door opens it and speaks to a constable in the corridor <\s>
<s> to treisure you can go with him <\s>
<s> in the meantime i'll just examine the balcony <\s>
<s> he goes out on the balcony followed by de levis <\s>
<s> to canynge damn de levis and his money <\s>
<s> it's deuced invidious all this general <\s>
<s> the inspector's no earthly <\s>
<s> there is a simultaneous re entry of the inspector from the balcony and of treisure and the constable from the corridor <\s>
<s> handing key room on the left sir <\s>
<s> handing key room on the right sir <\s>
<s> the inspector tries the keys in the door watched with tension by the others <\s>
<s> hands keys to constable who goes out followed by treisure <\s>
<s> i'll have to try every key in the house sir <\s>
<s> inspector do you really think it necessary to disturb the whole house and knock up all my guests <\s>
<s> it's most disagreeable all this you know <\s>
<s> the loss of the money is not such a great matter <\s>
<s> mr de levis has a very large income <\s>
<s> you could get the numbers of the notes from kentman the bookmaker inspector he'll probably have the big ones anyway <\s>
<s> shaking his head a bookie <\s>
<s> i don't suppose he will sir <\s>
<s> it's come and go with them all the time <\s>
<s> we don't want a meldon court scandal inspector <\s>
<s> well mr winsor i've formed my theory <\s>
<s> as he speaks de levis comes in from the balcony <\s>
<s> and i don't say to try the keys is necessary to it but strictly i ought to exhaust the possibilities <\s>
<s> what do you say de levis <\s>
<s> d'you want everybody in the house knocked up so that their keys can be tried <\s>
<s> whose face since his return expresses a curious excitement no i don't <\s>
<s> in my opinion the thief walked in before the door was locked probably during dinner and was under the bed <\s>
<s> he escaped by dropping from the balcony the creeper at that corner he points stage left has been violently wrenched <\s>
<s> i'll go down now and examine the grounds and i'll see you again sir <\s>
<s> he makes another entry in his note book goodnight then gentlemen <\s>
<s> with relief i'll come with you inspector <\s>
<s> he escorts him to the door and they go out <\s>
<s> suddenly general i know who took them <\s>
<s> the deuce you do <\s>
<s> are you following the inspector's theory <\s>
<s> pulling the shaving papers out of the case no <\s>
<s> the man who put those there was clever and cool enough to wrench that creeper off the balcony as a blind <\s>
<s> come and look here general <\s>
<s> he goes to the window the general follows <\s>
<s> de levis points stage right see the rail of my balcony and the rail of the next <\s>
<s> he holds up the cord of his dressing gown stretching his arms out i've measured it with this <\s>
<s> just over seven feet that's all <\s>
<s> if a man can take a standing jump on to a narrow bookcase four feet high and balance there he'd make nothing of that <\s>
<s> he goes out on the balcony and returns with a bit of broken creeper in his hand and holds it out into the light someone's stood on that the stalk's crushed the inner corner too where he'd naturally stand when he took his jump back <\s>
<s> after examining it stiffly that other balcony is young dancy's mr de levis a soldier and a gentleman <\s>
<s> this is an extraordinary insinuation <\s>
<s> i have intuitions general it's in my blood <\s>
<s> i see the whole thing <\s>
<s> dancy came up watched me into the bathroom tried my door slipped back into his dressing room saw my window was open took that jump sneaked the notes filled the case up with these wrenched the creeper there he points stage left for a blind jumped back and slipped downstairs again <\s>
<s> it didn't take him four minutes altogether <\s>
<s> very gravely this is outrageous de levis <\s>
<s> dancy says he was downstairs all the time <\s>
<s> you must either withdraw unreservedly or i must confront you with him <\s>
<s> if he'll return the notes and apologise i'll do nothing except cut him in future <\s>
<s> he gave me that filly you know as a hopeless weed and he's been pretty sick ever since that he was such a flat as not to see how good she was <\s>
<s> besides he's hard up i know <\s>
<s> after a vexed turn up and down the room it's mad sir to jump to conclusions like this <\s>
<s> not so mad as the conclusion dancy jumped to when he lighted on my balcony <\s>
<s> nobody could have taken this money who did not know you had it <\s>
<s> how do you know that he didn't <\s>
<s> do you know that he did <\s>
<s> i haven't the least doubt of it <\s>
<s> this is very ugly de levis <\s>
<s> i must tell winsor <\s>
<s> angrily tell the whole blooming lot <\s>
<s> you think i've no feelers but i've felt the atmosphere here i can tell you general <\s>
<s> if i were in dancy's shoes and he in mine your tone to me would be very different <\s>
<s> suavely frigid i'm not aware of using any tone as you call it <\s>
<s> but this is a private house mr de levis and something is due to our host and to the esprit de corps that exists among gentlemen <\s>
<s> since when is a thief a gentleman <\s>
<s> thick as thieves a good motto isn't it <\s>
<s> he goes to the door but stops before opening it now look here <\s>
<s> i have some knowledge of the world <\s>
<s> once an accusation like this passes beyond these walls no one can foresee the consequences <\s>
<s> captain dancy is a gallant fellow with a fine record as a soldier and only just married <\s>
<s> if he's as innocent as christ mud will stick to him unless the real thief is found <\s>
<s> in the old days of swords either you or he would not have gone out of this room alive <\s>
<s> it you persist in this absurd accusation you will both of you go out of this room dead in the eyes of society you for bringing it he for being the object of it <\s>
<s> do you think i don't know that i'm only tolerated for my money <\s>
<s> society can't add injury to insult and have my money as well that's all <\s>
<s> if the notes are restored i'll keep my mouth shut if they're not i shan't <\s>
<s> i'm certain i'm right <\s>
<s> i ask nothing better than to be confronted with dancy but if you prefer it deal with him in your own way for the sake of your esprit de corps <\s>
<s> pon my soul mr de levis you go too far <\s>
<s> not so far as i shall go general canynge if those notes aren't given back <\s>
<s> well de levis i'm afraid that's all we can do for the present <\s>
<s> so very sorry this should have happened in my house <\s>
<s> alter a silence there's a development winsor <\s>
<s> mr de levis accuses one of your guests <\s>
<s> of jumping from his balcony to this taking the notes and jumping back <\s>
<s> i've done my best to dissuade him from indulging the fancy without success <\s>
<s> dancy must be told <\s>
<s> you can deal with dancy in your own way <\s>
<s> all i want is the money back <\s>
<s> drily mr de levis feels that he is only valued for his money so that it is essential for him to have it back <\s>
<s> this is monstrous de levis <\s>
<s> i've known ronald dancy since he was a boy <\s>
<s> you talk about adding injury to insult de levis <\s>
<s> what do you call such treatment of a man who gave you the mare out of which you made this thousand pounds <\s>
<s> i didn't want the mare i took her as a favour <\s>
<s> with an eye to possibilities i venture to think the principle guides a good many transactions <\s>
<s> as if flicked on a raw spot in my race do you mean <\s>
<s> coldly i said nothing of the sort <\s>
<s> no you don't say these things any of you <\s>
<s> nor did i think it <\s>
<s> really de levis if this is the way you repay hospitality de levis <\s>
<s> hospitality that skins my feelings and costs me a thousand pounds <\s>
<s> go and get dancy winsor but don't say anything to him <\s>
<s> perhaps you will kindly control yourself and leave this to me <\s>
<s> de levis turns to the window and lights a cigarette <\s>
<s> winsor comes back followed by dancy <\s>
<s> for winsor's sake dancy we don't want any scandal or fuss about this affair <\s>
<s> we've tried to make the police understand that <\s>
<s> to my mind the whole thing turns on our finding who knew that de levis had this money <\s>
<s> it's about that we want to consult you <\s>
<s> kentman paid de levis round the corner in the further paddock he says <\s>
<s> de levis turns round from the window so that he and dancy are staring at each other <\s>
<s> did you hear anything that throws light dancy <\s>
<s> as it was your filly originally we thought perhaps you might <\s>
<s> didn't hear of the sale on the course at all <\s>
<s> then you can't suggest any one who could have known <\s>
<s> nothing else was taken you see <\s>
<s> de levis is known to be rolling as i am known to be stony <\s>
<s> there are a good many people still rolling besides mr de levis but not many people with so large a sum in their pocket books <\s>
<s> he won two races <\s>
<s> do you suggest that i bet in ready money <\s>
<s> i don't know how you bet and i don't care <\s>
<s> you can't help us then <\s>
<s> he looks fixedly at de levis <\s>
<s> putting his hand on dancy's arm nothing else thank you dancy <\s>
<s> canynge puts his hand up to his face <\s>
<s> you see de levis <\s>
<s> he didn't even know you'd got the money <\s>
<s> there is a knock on the door and the inspector enters <\s>
<s> i'm just going gentlemen <\s>
<s> the grounds i'm sorry to say have yielded nothing <\s>
<s> it's a bit of a puzzle <\s>
<s> i can pick up nothing near the terrace <\s>
<s> after a look at de levis whose face expresses too much h'm <\s>
<s> you'll take it up from the other end then inspector <\s>
<s> well we'll see what we can do with the bookmakers about the numbers sir <\s>
<s> before i go gentlemen you've had time to think it over there's no one you suspect in the house i suppose <\s>
<s> de levis's face is alive and uncertain <\s>
<s> canynge is staring at him very fixedly <\s>
<s> de levis turns and goes out on to the balcony <\s>
<s> if you're coming in to the racing to morrow sir you might give us a call <\s>
<s> i'll have seen kentman by then <\s>
<s> right you are inspector <\s>
<s> good night and many thanks <\s>
<s> he goes out winsor <\s>
<s> i thought that chap with a nod towards the balcony was going to <\s>
<s> look here general we must stop his tongue <\s>
<s> imagine it going the rounds <\s>
<s> they may never find the real thief you know <\s>
<s> it's the very devil for dancy <\s>
<s> dancy's sleeve was damp <\s>
<s> the two look at each other <\s>
<s> i i don't follow his voice is hesitative and lower showing that he does <\s>
<s> it was coming down hard a minute out in it would have been enough he motions with his chin towards the balcony <\s>
<s> hastily he must have been out on his balcony since <\s>
<s> it stopped before i came up half an hour ago <\s>
<s> he's been leaning on the wet stone then <\s>
<s> with the outside of the upper part of the arm <\s>
<s> against the wall perhaps <\s>
<s> there may be a dozen explanations <\s>
<s> very low and with great concentration i entirely and absolutely refuse to believe anything of the sort against ronald dancy in my house <\s>
<s> dash it general we must do as we'd be done by <\s>
<s> it hits us all it hits us all <\s>
<s> raising his voice mr de levis <\s>
<s> de levis returns into view in the centre of the open window <\s>
<s> with cold decision young dancy was an officer and is a gentleman this insinuation is pure supposition and you must not make it <\s>
<s> do you understand me <\s>
<s> my tongue is still mine general if my money isn't <\s>
<s> you're a member of three clubs you want to be member of a fourth <\s>
<s> no one who makes such an insinuation against a fellow guest in a country house except on absolute proof can do so without complete ostracism <\s>
<s> have we your word to say nothing <\s>
<s> not at all simple warning <\s>
<s> if you consider it necessary in your interests to start this scandal no matter how we shall consider it necessary in ours to dissociate ourselves completely from one who so recklessly disregards the unwritten code <\s>
<s> do you think your code applies to me <\s>
<s> to anyone who aspires to be a gentleman sir <\s>
<s> but you haven't known me since i was a boy <\s>
<s> make up your mind <\s>
<s> i'm not a fool general <\s>
<s> i know perfectly well that you can get me outed <\s>
<s> sullenly i'll say nothing about it unless i get more proof <\s>
<s> we have implicit faith in dancy <\s>
<s> there is a moment's encounter of eyes the general's steady shrewd impassive winsor's angry and defiant de levis's mocking a little triumphant malicious <\s>
<s> then canynge and winsor go to the door and pass out <\s>
<s> curtain act ii scene i afternoon three weeks later in the card room of a london club <\s>

<s> looking at his watch let's hear what's won the cambridgeshire <\s>
<s> ring won't you winsor <\s>
<s> winsor rings st erth <\s>
<s> by the way canynge young de levis was blackballed <\s>
<s> i looked in on my way down <\s>
<s> canynge sits very still and winsor utters a disturbed sound <\s>
<s> but of c course he was general <\s>
<s> what did you expect <\s>
<s> what won the cambridgeshire <\s>
<s> sherbet second barbizon third <\s>
<s> nine to one the winner <\s>
<s> and de levis sold her <\s>
<s> but he got a good p price i suppose <\s>
<s> the other three look at him <\s>
<s> many a slip between price and pocket young man <\s>
<s> i say is that the yarn that's going round about his having had a lot of m money stolen in a country house <\s>
<s> he'll be pretty s sick <\s>
<s> you and i borring <\s>
<s> he sits down in canynge's chair and the general takes his place by the fire <\s>
<s> won't dancy be mad <\s>
<s> he gave that filly away to save her keep <\s>
<s> he was rather pleased to find somebody who'd take her <\s>
<s> bentman must have won a p pot <\s>
<s> she was at thirty threes a fortnight ago <\s>
<s> all the money goes to fellows who don't know a horse from a haystack <\s>
<s> profoundly and care less <\s>
<s> we want men racing to whom a horse means something <\s>
<s> i thought the horse m meant the same to everyone general chance to get the b better of one's neighbour <\s>
<s> with feeling the horse is a noble animal sir as you'd know if you'd owed your life to them as often as i have <\s>
<s> they always try to take mine general <\s>
<s> i shall never belong to the noble f fellowship of the horse <\s>
<s> as borring begins to deal the door is opened and major colford appears a lean and moustached cavalryman <\s>
<s> something in the tone of his voice brings them all to a standstill <\s>
<s> i want your advice <\s>
<s> young de levis in there he points to the billiard room from which he has just come has started a blasphemous story canynge <\s>
<s> mr borring d'you mind colford <\s>
<s> it makes no odds general <\s>
<s> four of us in there heard him <\s>
<s> he's saying it was ronald dancy robbed him down at winsor's <\s>
<s> the fellow's mad over losing the price of that filly now she's won the cambridgeshire <\s>

<s> if he hadn't been i'd have taken it on myself to wring the bounder's neck <\s>
<s> winsor and borring have risen <\s>
<s> st erth alone remains seated <\s>
<s> after consulting st erth with a look ask de levis to be good enough to come in here <\s>
<s> borring you might see that dancy doesn't leave the club <\s>
<s> we shall want him <\s>
<s> don't say anything to him and use your tact to keep people off <\s>
<s> borring goes out followed by colford <\s>
<s> result of hearing he was black balled pretty slippy <\s>
<s> st erth i told you there was good reason when i asked you to back young de levis <\s>
<s> winsor and i knew of this insinuation i wanted to keep his tongue quiet <\s>
<s> it's just wild assertion to have it bandied about was unfair to dancy <\s>
<s> the duel used to keep people's tongues in order <\s>
<s> it never settled anything except who could shoot straightest <\s>
<s> re appearing de levis says he's nothing to add to what he said to you before on the subject <\s>
<s> kindly tell him that if he wishes to remain a member of this club he must account to the committee for such a charge against a fellow member <\s>
<s> four of us are here and form a quorum <\s>
<s> colford goes out again <\s>
<s> did kentman ever give the police the numbers of those notes winsor <\s>
<s> he only had the numbers of two the hundred and one of the fifties <\s>
<s> and they haven't traced em <\s>
<s> as he speaks de levis comes in <\s>
<s> he is in a highly coloured not to say excited state <\s>
<s> it's a little too strong all this a little too strong <\s>
<s> under emotion his voice is slightly more exotic <\s>
<s> calmly it is obvious mr de levis that you and captain dancy can't both remain members of this club <\s>
<s> we ask you for an explanation before requesting one resignation or the other <\s>
<s> you've let me down <\s>
<s> well i shall tell people that you and lord st erth backed me up for one club and asked me to resign from another <\s>
<s> it's a matter of indifference to me sir what you tell people <\s>
<s> drily you seem a venomous young man <\s>
<s> i'll tell you what seems to me venomous my lord chasing a man like a pack of hounds because he isn't your breed <\s>
<s> you appear to have your breed on the brain sir <\s>
<s> nobody else does so far as i know <\s>
<s> suppose i had robbed dancy would you chase him out for complaining of it <\s>
<s> if you repeat that canynge <\s>
<s> you make this accusation that dancy stole your money in my house on no proof no proof and you expect dancy's friends to treat you as if you were a gentleman <\s>
<s> that's too strong if you like <\s>
<s> bentman told me at newmarket yesterday that dancy did know of the sale <\s>
<s> he told goole and goole says that he himself spoke of it to dancy <\s>
<s> dancy told you he didn't know of it in general canynge's presence and mine <\s>
<s> to canynge you can't deny that if you want to <\s>
<s> choose your expressions more nicely please <\s>
<s> did they find any footmarks in the grounds below that torn creeper <\s>
<s> you saw how he can jump he won ten pounds from me that same evening betting on what he knew was a certainty <\s>
<s> that's your dancy a common sharper <\s>
<s> nodding towards the billiard room are those fellows still in there colford <\s>
<s> then bring dancy up will you <\s>
<s> but don't say anything to him <\s>
<s> to de levis you may think yourself damned lucky if he doesn't break your neck <\s>
<s> the three who are left with de levis avert their eyes from him <\s>
<s> smouldering i have a memory and a sting too <\s>
<s> yes my lord since you are good enough to call me venomous <\s>
<s> to canynge i quite understand i'm marked for coventry now whatever happens <\s>
<s> well i'll take dancy with me <\s>
<s> to himself this club has always had a decent quiet name <\s>
<s> are you going to retract and apologise in front of dancy and the members who heard you <\s>
<s> you must be a very rich man sir <\s>
<s> a jury is likely to take the view that money can hardly compensate for an accusation of that sort <\s>
<s> de levis stands silent <\s>
<s> courts of law require proof <\s>
<s> he can make it a criminal action <\s>
<s> unless you stop this at once you may find yourself in prison <\s>
<s> if you can stop it that is <\s>
<s> if i were young dancy nothing should induce me <\s>
<s> but you didn't steal my money lord st erth <\s>
<s> you're deuced positive sir <\s>
<s> so far as i could understand it there were a dozen ways you could have been robbed <\s>
<s> it seems to me you value other men's reputations very lightly <\s>
<s> confront me with dancy and give me fair play <\s>
<s> aside to canynge is it fair to dancy not to let him know <\s>
<s> our duty is to the club now winsor <\s>
<s> we must have this cleared up <\s>
<s> colford comes in followed by borring and dancy <\s>
<s> captain dancy a serious accusation has been made against you by this gentleman in the presence of several members of the club <\s>
<s> that you robbed him of that money at winsor's <\s>
<s> hard and tense indeed <\s>
<s> on what grounds is he good enough to say that <\s>
<s> tense too you gave me that filly to save yourself her keep and you've been mad about it ever since you knew from goole that i had sold her to kentman and been paid in cash yet i heard you myself deny that you knew it <\s>
<s> you had the next room to me and you can jump like a cat as we saw that evening i found some creepers crushed by a weight on my balcony on that side <\s>
<s> when i went to the bath your door was open and when i came back it was shut <\s>
<s> that's the first we have heard about the door <\s>
<s> i remembered it afterwards <\s>
<s> with intense deliberation i'll settle this matter with any weapons when and where he likes <\s>
<s> drily it can't be settled that way you know very well <\s>
<s> you must take it to the courts unless he retracts <\s>
<s> why did you tell general canynge you didn't know kentman had paid me in cash <\s>
<s> then kentman and goole lied for no reason <\s>
<s> that's nothing to do with me <\s>
<s> if you were downstairs all the time as you say why was your door first open and then shut <\s>
<s> being downstairs how should i know <\s>
<s> i should like to hear what your wife says about it <\s>
<s> leave my wife alone you damned jew <\s>
<s> white with rage thief <\s>
<s> you're very smart dead men tell no tales <\s>
<s> bring your action and we shall see <\s>
<s> dancy takes a step towards him but canynge and winsor interpose <\s>
<s> that'll do mr de levis we won't keep you <\s>
<s> he looks round kindly consider your membership suspended till this matter has been threshed out <\s>
<s> tremulous with anger don't trouble yourselves about my membership <\s>
<s> to dancy you called me a damned jew <\s>
<s> my race was old when you were all savages <\s>
<s> i am proud to be a jew <\s>
<s> au revoir in the courts <\s>
<s> he goes out and silence follows his departure <\s>
<s> if the brute won't fight what am i to do sir <\s>
<s> we've told you take action to clear your name <\s>
<s> colford you saw me in the hall writing letters after our game <\s>
<s> certainly i did you were there when i went to the smoking room <\s>
<s> how long after you left the billiard room <\s>
<s> it's impossible for me to prove that i was there all the time <\s>
<s> it's for de levis to prove what he asserts <\s>
<s> you heard what he said about goole <\s>
<s> if he told me i didn't take it in <\s>
<s> this concerns the honour of the club <\s>
<s> are you going to take action <\s>
<s> slowly that is a very expensive business lord st erth and i'm hard up <\s>
<s> i must think it over <\s>
<s> he looks round from face to face am i to take it that there is a doubt in your minds gentlemen <\s>
<s> that's not the question dancy <\s>
<s> this accusation was overheard by various members and we represent the club <\s>
<s> if you don't take action judgment will naturally go by default <\s>
<s> i might prefer to look on the whole thing as beneath contempt <\s>
<s> he turns and goes out <\s>
<s> when he is gone there is an even longer silence than after de levis's departure <\s>

<s> i've known him all his life <\s>
<s> you may have my head if he did it lord st erth <\s>
<s> he and i have been in too many holes together <\s>
<s> my toe itches for that fellow's butt end <\s>
<s> i'm sorry but has he t taken it in quite the right way <\s>
<s> i should have thought hearing it s suddenly colford <\s>
<s> it's perfectly damnable for him <\s>
<s> more damnable if he did it winsor <\s>
<s> the courts are b beastly distrustful don't you know <\s>
<s> his word's good enough for me <\s>
<s> we're as anxious to believe dancy as you colford for the honour of the army and the club <\s>
<s> of course he'll bring a case when he's thought it over <\s>
<s> what are we to do in the meantime <\s>
<s> if dancy's asked to resign you may take my resignation too <\s>
<s> i thought his wanting to f fight him a bit screeny <\s>
<s> wouldn't you have wanted a shot at the brute <\s>
<s> what'll be his position even if he wins <\s>
<s> damages and a stain on his c character <\s>
<s> quite so unless they find the real thief <\s>
<s> people always believe the worst <\s>
<s> glaring at borring they do <\s>
<s> there is no decent way out of a thing of this sort <\s>

<s> i'm sorry for young mrs dancy poor woman <\s>
<s> are you going to play any more <\s>
<s> good night to you <\s>
<s> canynge can i give you a lift <\s>
<s> he goes out followed by canynge <\s>
<s> after a slight pause well i shall go and take the t temperature of the club <\s>
<s> damn that effeminate stammering chap <\s>
<s> what can we do for dancy winsor <\s>
<s> a slight pause the general felt his coat sleeve that night and it was wet <\s>
<s> an old school fellow a brother officer and a pal <\s>
<s> if he did do it colford <\s>
<s> but if he did i'd stick to him and see him through it if i could <\s>
<s> winsor walks over to the fire stares into it turns round and stares at colford who is standing motionless <\s>
<s> scene ii note this should be a small set capable of being set quickly within that of the previous scene morning of the following day <\s>
<s> in the sitting room of this small abode mabel dancy and margaret orme are sitting full face to the audience on a couch in the centre of the room in front of the imaginary window <\s>
<s> there is a fireplace left with fire burning a door below it left and a door on the right facing the audience leads to a corridor and the outer door of the flat which is visible <\s>
<s> their voices are heard in rapid exchange then as the curtain rises so does mabel <\s>
<s> she lights a cigarette and hands the case to mabel who however sees nothing but her own thoughts de levis might just as well have pitched on me except that i can't jump more than six inches in these skirts <\s>
<s> yesterday afternoon at the club did you say <\s>
<s> ronny hasn't said a word to me <\s>
<s> with a long puff of smoke doesn't want you bothered <\s>
<s> haven't you found out mabel that he isn't exactly communicative <\s>
<s> no desperate character is <\s>
<s> wives are at a disadvantage especially early on <\s>
<s> you've never hunted with him my dear <\s>
<s> he takes more sudden decisions than any man i ever knew <\s>
<s> he's taking one now i'll bet <\s>
<s> that beast de levis <\s>
<s> i was in our room next door all the time <\s>
<s> was the door into ronny's dressing room open <\s>
<s> i don't know i i think it was <\s>
<s> well you can say so in court any way <\s>
<s> not that it matters <\s>
<s> wives are liars by law <\s>
<s> staring down at her what do you mean court <\s>
<s> my dear he'll have to bring an action for defamation of character or whatever they call it <\s>
<s> were they talking of this last night at the winsor's <\s>
<s> well you know a dinner table mabel scandal is heaven sent at this time of year <\s>
<s> it's terrible such a thing terrible <\s>
<s> gloomily if only ronny weren't known to be so broke <\s>
<s> with her hands to her forehead i can't realise i simply can't <\s>
<s> if there's a case would it be all right afterwards <\s>
<s> do you remember st offert cards <\s>
<s> no you wouldn't you were in high frocks <\s>
<s> well st offert got damages but he also got the hoof underneath <\s>
<s> he lives in ireland <\s>
<s> there isn't the slightest connection so far as i can see mabel between innocence and reputation <\s>
<s> we'll fight it tooth and nail <\s>
<s> mabel you're pure wool right through everybody's sorry for you <\s>
<s> it's for him they ought margaret <\s>
<s> again handing the cigarette case do smoke old thing <\s>
<s> mabel takes a cigarette this time but does not light it <\s>
<s> it isn't altogether simple <\s>
<s> general canynge was there last night <\s>
<s> you don't mind my being beastly frank do you <\s>
<s> well he's all for esprit de corps and that <\s>
<s> but he was awfully silent <\s>
<s> i hate half hearted friends <\s>
<s> loyalty comes before everything <\s>
<s> ye es but loyalties cut up against each other sometimes you know <\s>
<s> i must see ronny <\s>
<s> d'you mind if i go and try to get him on the telephone <\s>
<s> mabel goes out by the door left <\s>
<s> she curls herself into a corner of the sofa as if trying to get away from life <\s>
<s> margaret stirs gets up and goes out into the corridor where she opens the door to lady adela winsor whom she precedes into the sitting room <\s>

<s> d'you know that child knew nothing <\s>
<s> adela if there's going to be an action we shall be witnesses <\s>
<s> i shall wear black georgette with an ecru hat <\s>
<s> have you ever given evidence <\s>
<s> it must be too frightfully thrilling <\s>
<s> why did i ever ask that wretch de levis <\s>
<s> i used to think him pathetic <\s>
<s> meg did you know  ronald dancy's coat was wet <\s>
<s> the general happened to feel it <\s>
<s> so that's why he was so silent <\s>
<s> yes and after the scene in the club yesterday he went to see those bookmakers and goole what a name is sure he told dancy about the sale <\s>
<s> suddenly i don't care <\s>
<s> he's my third cousin <\s>
<s> don't you feel you couldn't adela <\s>
<s> stand for de levis against one of ourselves <\s>
<s> that's very narrow meg <\s>
<s> i know lots of splendid jews and i rather liked little ferdy but when it comes to the point <\s>
<s> they all stick together why shouldn't we <\s>
<s> it's in the blood <\s>
<s> open your jugular and see if you haven't got it <\s>
<s> my dear my great grandmother was a jewess <\s>
<s> i'm very proud of her <\s>
<s> stretching herself prejudices adela or are they loyalties i don't know cris cross we all cut each other's throats from the best of motives <\s>
<s> i shall remember that <\s>
<s> holding up a finger you got it from bergson meg <\s>
<s> yes have you ever read him <\s>
<s> looking at the bedroom door that poor child <\s>
<s> i shall tell every body it's ridiculous <\s>
<s> you don't really think ronald dancy <\s>
<s> i don't know adela <\s>
<s> there are people who simply can't live without danger <\s>
<s> i'm rather like that myself <\s>
<s> they're all right when they're getting the d s o <\s>
<s> or shooting man eaters but if there's no excitement going they'll make it out of sheer craving <\s>
<s> i've seen ronny dancy do the maddest things for no mortal reason except the risk <\s>
<s> he's had a past you know <\s>
<s> he did splendidly in the war of course because it suited him but just before don't you remember a very queer bit of riding <\s>
<s> most dare devil thing but not quite <\s>
<s> you must remember it was awfully talked about <\s>
<s> and then of course right up to his marriage she lights a cigarette lady a <\s>
<s> meg you're very tantalising <\s>
<s> a foreign looking girl most plummy <\s>
<s> ronny's got charm this mabel child doesn't know in the least what she's got hold of <\s>
<s> but they're so fond of each other <\s>
<s> the general isn't mentioning the coat is he <\s>
<s> it was only to charles <\s>
<s> did you get him <\s>
<s> no he's not at tattersall's nor at the club <\s>
<s> lady adela rises and greets her with an air which suggests bereavement <\s>
<s> nobody's going to believe this my dear <\s>
<s> looking straight at her nobody who does need come here or trouble to speak to us again <\s>
<s> that's what i was afraid of you're going to be defiant <\s>
<s> just be perfectly natural <\s>
<s> so easy isn't it <\s>
<s> i could kill anybody who believes such a thing <\s>
<s> you'll want a solicitor mabel go to old mr jacob twisden <\s>
<s> yes he's so comforting <\s>
<s> he got my pearls back once without loss of life <\s>
<s> a frightfully good fireside manner <\s>
<s> do get him here mabel and have a heart to heart talk all three of you <\s>
<s> with a smile very good of you to have come <\s>
<s> ronny this is quite too but his face dries her up and sidling past she goes <\s>
<s> charles sent his love her voice dwindles on the word and she too goes <\s>
<s> crossing to his wife what have they been saying <\s>
<s> why didn't you tell me <\s>
<s> i wanted to see de levis again first <\s>
<s> she suddenly clasps and kisses him <\s>
<s> he does not return the kiss but remains rigid in her arms so that she draws away and looks at him it's hurt you awfully i know <\s>
<s> apart from that muck this is a ghastly tame cat sort of life <\s>
<s> let's cut it and get out to nairobi <\s>
<s> i can scare up the money for that <\s>
<s> aghast but how can we <\s>
<s> everybody would say ronny <\s>
<s> we shan't be here <\s>
<s> i couldn't bear people to think dancy <\s>
<s> i don't care a damn what people think monkeys and cats <\s>
<s> i never could stand their rotten menagerie <\s>
<s> besides what does it matter how i act if i bring an action and get damages if i pound him to a jelly it's all no good <\s>
<s> i can't prove it <\s>
<s> there'll be plenty of people unconvinced <\s>
<s> but they'll find the real thief <\s>
<s> with a queer little smile will staying here help them to do that <\s>
<s> in a sort of agony oh <\s>
<s> i couldn't it looks like running away <\s>
<s> we must stay and fight it <\s>
<s> suppose i didn't get a verdict you never can tell <\s>
<s> but you must i was there all the time with the door open <\s>
<s> but you're my wife <\s>
<s> bewildered ronny i don't understand suppose i'd been accused of stealing pearls <\s>
<s> but i might just as easily <\s>
<s> what would you think of me if i ran away from it <\s>
<s> a pause all right <\s>
<s> you shall have a run for your money <\s>
<s> i'll go and see old twisden <\s>
<s> dancy shakes his head why not <\s>
<s> i can't be happy a moment unless i'm fighting this <\s>
<s> dancy puts out his hand suddenly and grips hers <\s>
<s> you are a little brick <\s>
<s> pressing his hand to her breast and looking into his face do you know what margaret called you <\s>
<s> i'm not a tame cat any more than she <\s>
<s> mabel goes out to the door and her voice is heard saying coldly <\s>
<s> will you wait a minute please <\s>
<s> it's de levis to see you <\s>
<s> in a low voice let me see him alone first <\s>
<s> just for a minute <\s>
<s> after a moment's silence go ahead <\s>
<s> he goes out into the bedroom <\s>
<s> going to the door right come in <\s>
<s> de levis comes in and stands embarrassed <\s>
<s> with a slight bow your husband mrs dancy <\s>
<s> why do you want to see him <\s>
<s> he came round to my rooms just now when i was out <\s>
<s> he threatened me yesterday <\s>
<s> i don't choose him to suppose i'm afraid of him <\s>
<s> with a great and manifest effort at self control mr de levis you are robbing my husband of his good name <\s>
<s> sincerely i admire your trustfulness mrs dancy <\s>
<s> staring at him how can you do it <\s>
<s> what do you want <\s>
<s> you can't possibly believe that my husband is a thief <\s>
<s> don't you know that i was in our bedroom all the time with the door open <\s>
<s> do you accuse me too <\s>
<s> i must have seen i must have heard <\s>
<s> a wife's memory is not very good when her husband is in danger <\s>
<s> in other words i'm lying <\s>
<s> your wish is mother to your thought that's all <\s>
<s> after staring again with a sort of horror turns to get control of herself <\s>
<s> then turning back to him mr de levis i appeal to you as a gentleman to behave to us as you would we should behave to you <\s>
<s> withdraw this wicked charge and write an apology that ronald can show <\s>
<s> mrs dancy i am not a gentleman i am only a damned jew <\s>
<s> yesterday i might possibly have withdrawn to spare you <\s>
<s> but when my race is insulted i have nothing to say to your husband but as he wishes to see me i've come <\s>
<s> please let him know <\s>
<s> regarding him again with that look of horror slowly i think what you are doing is too horrible for words <\s>
<s> de levis gives her a slight bow and as he does so dancy comes quickly in left <\s>
<s> the two men stand with the length of the sofa between them <\s>
<s> mabel behind the sofa turns her eyes on her husband who has a paper in his right hand <\s>
<s> you came to see me <\s>
<s> i want you to sign this <\s>
<s> i will sign nothing <\s>
<s> let me read it i apologise to captain dancy for the reckless and monstrous charge i made against him and i retract every word of it <\s>
<s> i tell you this is useless <\s>
<s> i will sign nothing <\s>
<s> the charge is true you wouldn't be playing this game if it weren't <\s>
<s> you'll hardly try violence in the presence of your wife and if you try it anywhere else look out for yourself <\s>
<s> mabel i want to speak to him alone <\s>
<s> quite right mrs dancy <\s>
<s> black and tan swashbuckling will only make things worse for him <\s>
<s> so you shelter behind a woman do you you skulking cur <\s>
<s> de levis takes a step with fists clenched and eyes blazing <\s>
<s> dancy too stands ready to spring the moment is cut short by mabel going quickly to her husband <\s>
<s> he isn't worth it <\s>
<s> dancy suddenly tears the paper in two and flings it into the fire <\s>
<s> get out of here you swine <\s>
<s> de levis stands a moment irresolute then turning to the door he opens it stands again for a moment with a smile on his face then goes <\s>
<s> mabel crosses swiftly to the door and shuts it as the outer door closes <\s>
<s> then she stands quite still looking at her husband her face expressing a sort of startled suspense <\s>
<s> turning and looking at her well <\s>
<s> do you agree with him <\s>
<s> what do you mean <\s>
<s> that i wouldn't be playing this game unless mabel <\s>
<s> you don't know much of me mabel <\s>
<s> what did you say to that swine <\s>
<s> her face averted that he was robbing us <\s>
<s> turning to him suddenly ronny you didn't <\s>
<s> i thought that was coming <\s>
<s> covering her face oh <\s>
<s> how horrible of me how horrible <\s>
<s> the thing looks bad <\s>
<s> dropping her hands if i can't believe in you who can <\s>
<s> going to him throwing her arms round him and looking up into his face ronny <\s>
<s> if all the world i'd believe in you <\s>
<s> you know i would <\s>
<s> that's all right mabs <\s>
<s> his face above her head is contorted for a moment then hardens into a mask well what shall we do <\s>
<s> let's go to that lawyer let's go mabel <\s>
<s> get your hat on <\s>
<s> mabel passes him and goes into the bedroom left <\s>
<s> dancy left alone stands quite still staring before him <\s>
<s> with a sudden shrug of his shoulders he moves quickly to his hat and takes it up just as mabel returns ready to go out <\s>
<s> he opens the door and crossing him she stops in the doorway looking up with a clear and trustful gaze as the curtain falls <\s>
<s> act iii scene i three months later <\s>
<s> old mr jacob twisden's room at the offices of twisden graviter in lincoln's inn fields is spacious with two large windows at back a fine old fireplace right a door below it and two doors left <\s>
<s> between the windows is a large table sideways to the window wall with a chair in the middle on the right hand side a chair against the wall and a client's chair on the left hand side <\s>
<s> graviter twisden's much younger partner is standing in front of the right hand window looking out on to the fields where the lamps are being lighted and a taxi's engine is running down below <\s>
<s> he turns his sanguine shrewd face from the window towards a grandfather dock between the doors left which is striking four <\s>
<s> the door left forward is opened <\s>
<s> entering a mr gilman sir to see mr twisden <\s>
<s> but important he says <\s>
<s> graviter sits right of table <\s>
<s> the clerk returns ushering in an oldish man who looks what he is the proprietor of a large modern grocery store <\s>
<s> he wears a dark overcoat and carries a pot hat <\s>
<s> his gingery grey moustache and mutton chop whiskers give him the expression of a cat <\s>
<s> sizing up his social standing mr gilman <\s>
<s> doubtfully mr jacob twisden <\s>
<s> graviter my name is <\s>
<s> mr twisden's not in then <\s>
<s> he's at the courts <\s>
<s> they're just up he should be in directly <\s>
<s> but he'll be busy <\s>
<s> old mr jacob twisden i've heard of him <\s>
<s> it's this dancy de levis case that's keepin him at the courts i suppose <\s>
<s> won't be finished for a day or two <\s>
<s> graviter shakes his head <\s>
<s> astonishin the interest taken in it <\s>
<s> the smart set eh <\s>
<s> this captain dancy got the d s o didn't he <\s>
<s> sad to have a thing like that said about you <\s>
<s> i thought he gave his evidence well and his wife too <\s>
<s> looks as if this de levis had got some private spite <\s>
<s> searchy la femme i said to mrs gilman only this morning before i graviter <\s>
<s> by the way sir what is your business <\s>
<s> well my business here no if you'll excuse me i'd rather wait and see old mr jacob twisden <\s>
<s> it's delicate and i'd like his experience <\s>
<s> with a shrug very well then perhaps you'll go in there <\s>
<s> he moves towards the door left back <\s>
<s> following you see i've never been mixed up with the law graviter <\s>
<s> opening the door no <\s>
<s> and i don't want to begin <\s>
<s> when you do you don't know where you'll stop do you <\s>
<s> you see i've only come from a sense of duty and other reasons <\s>
<s> producing card this is my card <\s>
<s> gilman's several branches but this is the ead <\s>
<s> grocery i daresay you know me or your wife does <\s>
<s> they say old mr jacob twisden refused a knighthood <\s>
<s> if it's not a rude question why was that <\s>
<s> ask him sir ask him <\s>
<s> i said to my wife at the time he's holdin out for a baronetcy <\s>
<s> graviter closes the door with an exasperated smile <\s>
<s> opening the door left forward mr winsor sir and miss orme <\s>
<s> they enter and the clerk withdraws <\s>
<s> how d'you do miss orme <\s>
<s> how do you do winsor <\s>
<s> twisden not back graviter <\s>
<s> well they've got through de levis's witnesses <\s>
<s> sir frederick was at the very top of his form <\s>
<s> it's looking quite well <\s>
<s> but i hear they've just subpoenaed canynge after all <\s>
<s> his evidence is to be taken to morrow <\s>
<s> i said dancy ought to have called him <\s>
<s> sir frederic decided that he could use him better in cross examination <\s>
<s> i don't know that <\s>
<s> can i go and see him before he gives evidence to morrow <\s>
<s> i should like to hear mr jacob on that winsor <\s>
<s> he'll be in directly <\s>
<s> they had kentman and goole the inspector the other bobby my footman dancy's banker and his tailor <\s>
<s> did we shake kentman or goole <\s>
<s> by the way the numbers of those two notes were given and i see they're published in the evening papers <\s>
<s> i suppose the police wanted that <\s>
<s> i tell you what i find graviter a general feeling that there's something behind it all that doesn't come out <\s>
<s> the public wants it's money's worth always does in these society cases they brew so long beforehand you see <\s>
<s> they're looking for something lurid <\s>
<s> when i was in the bog i thought they were looking for me <\s>
<s> taking out her cigarette case i suppose i mustn't smoke mr graviter <\s>
<s> won't mr jacob have a fit <\s>
<s> yes but not till you've gone <\s>
<s> she lights a cigarette <\s>
<s> suddenly it's becoming a sort of dreyfus case people taking sides quite outside the evidence <\s>
<s> there are more of the chosen in court every day <\s>
<s> mr graviter have you noticed the two on the jury <\s>
<s> with a smile no i can't say margaret <\s>
<s> don't you think they ought to have been challenged <\s>
<s> de levis might have challenged the other ten miss orme <\s>
<s> i never thought of that <\s>
<s> as she speaks the door left forward is opened and old mr jacob twisden comes in <\s>
<s> he is tallish and narrow sixty eight years old grey with narrow little whiskers curling round his narrow ears and a narrow bow ribbon curling round his collar <\s>
<s> he wears a long narrow tailed coat and strapped trousers on his narrow legs <\s>
<s> his nose and face are narrow shrewd and kindly <\s>
<s> he has a way of narrowing his shrewd and kindly eyes <\s>
<s> his nose is seen to twitch and snig <\s>
<s> how are you charles <\s>
<s> how do you do my dear <\s>
<s> dear mr jacob i'm smoking <\s>
<s> but they don't allow it in court you know <\s>
<s> the judge might have a hookah <\s>
<s> wouldn't he look sweet the darling <\s>
<s> with a little old fashioned bow it does not become everybody as it becomes you margaret <\s>
<s> mr jacob how charming <\s>
<s> with a slight grimace she puts out her cigarette <\s>
<s> man called gilman waiting in there to see you specially <\s>
<s> turn up the light would you graviter <\s>
<s> turning up the light excuse me <\s>
<s> look here mr twisden twisden <\s>
<s> sit down sit down my dear <\s>
<s> and he himself sits behind the table as a cup of tea is brought in to him by the young clerk with two marie biscuits in the saucer <\s>
<s> will you have some margaret <\s>
<s> no dear mr jacob <\s>
<s> the door is closed <\s>
<s> dipping a biscuit in the tea now then <\s>
<s> the general knows something which on the face of it looks rather queer <\s>
<s> now that he's going to be called oughtn't dancy to be told of it so that he may be ready with his explanation in case it comes out <\s>
<s> pouring some tea into the saucer without knowing i can't tell you <\s>
<s> winsor and margaret exchange looks and twisden drinks from the saucer <\s>
<s> it rained that evening at meldon <\s>
<s> the general happened to put his hand on dancy's shoulder and it was damp <\s>
<s> twisden puts the saucer down and replaces the cup in it <\s>
<s> they both look intently at him <\s>
<s> i take it that general canynge won't say anything he's not compelled to say <\s>
<s> no of course but mr jacob they might ask they know it rained <\s>
<s> and he is such a george washington <\s>
<s> toying with a pair of tortoise shell glasses they didn't ask either of you <\s>
<s> still no harm in your telling dancy <\s>
<s> i'd rather you did it margaret <\s>
<s> she mechanically takes out her cigarette case catches the lift of twisden's eyebrows and puts it back <\s>
<s> well we'll go together <\s>
<s> i don't want mrs dancy to hear <\s>
<s> do tell me mr jacob is he going to win <\s>
<s> i think so margaret i think so <\s>
<s> it'll be too frightful if he doesn't get a verdict after all this <\s>
<s> but i don't know what we shall do when it's over <\s>
<s> i've been sitting in that court all these three days watching and it's made me feel there's nothing we like better than seeing people skinned <\s>
<s> well bye bye bless you <\s>
<s> twisden rises and pats her hand <\s>
<s> half a second margaret <\s>
<s> she nods and goes out <\s>
<s> mr twisden what do you really think <\s>
<s> i am dancy's lawyer my dear charles as well as yours <\s>
<s> well can i go and see canynge <\s>
<s> if they get that out of him and recall me am i to say he told me of it at the time <\s>
<s> you didn't feel the coat yourself <\s>
<s> and dancy wasn't present <\s>
<s> then what canynge told you is not evidence he'll stop your being asked <\s>
<s> twisden behind his table motionless taps his teeth with the eyeglasses in his narrow well kept hand <\s>
<s> after a long shake of his head and a shrug of his rather high shoulders he snips goes to the window and opens it <\s>
<s> then crossing to the door left back he throws it open and says twisden <\s>
<s> at your service sir <\s>
<s> gilman comes forth nursing his pot hat <\s>
<s> twisden closes the window behind him and takes his seat <\s>
<s> taking the client's chair to the left of the table mr twisden i believe <\s>
<s> my name's gilman head of gilman's department stores <\s>
<s> you have my card <\s>
<s> looking at the card yes <\s>
<s> what can we do for you <\s>
<s> well i've come to you from a sense of duty sir and also a feelin of embarrassment <\s>
<s> he takes from his breast pocket an evening paper you see i've been followin this dancy case it's a good deal talked of in putney and i read this at half past two this afternoon <\s>
<s> to be precise at 2.25 <\s>
<s> he rises and hands the paper to twisden and with a thick gloved forefinger indicates a passage when i read these numbers i appened to remember givin change for a fifty pound note don't often ave one in you know so i went to the cash box out of curiosity to see that i adn't got it <\s>
<s> well i ad and here it is <\s>
<s> he draws out from his breast pocket and lays before twisden a fifty pound banknote it was brought in to change by a customer of mine three days ago and he got value for it <\s>
<s> now that's a stolen note it seems and you'd like to know what i did <\s>
<s> mind you that customer of mine i've known im well eight or nine years an italian he is wine salesman and so far's i know a respectable man foreign lookin but nothin more <\s>
<s> now this was at alf past two and i was at my head branch at putney where i live <\s>
<s> i want you to mark the time so as you'll see i aven't wasted a minute <\s>
<s> i took a cab and i drove straight to my customer's private residence in putney where he lives with his daughter ricardos his name is paolio ricardos <\s>
<s> they tell me there that he's at his business shop in the city <\s>
<s> so off i go in the cab again and there i find him <\s>
<s> well sir i showed this paper to him and i produced the note <\s>
<s> here i said you brought this to me and you got value for it <\s>
<s> well that man was taken aback <\s>
<s> if i'm a judge mr twisden he was taken aback not to speak in a guilty way but he was as you might say flummoxed <\s>
<s> now i said to him where did you get it that's the point <\s>
<s> he took his time to answer and then he said well mr gilman he said you know me i am an honourable man <\s>
<s> i can't tell you offhand but i am above the board <\s>
<s> he's foreign you know in his expressions <\s>
<s> yes i said that's all very well i said but here i've got a stolen note and you've got the value for it <\s>
<s> now i tell you i said what i'm going to do; i'm going straight with this note to mr jacob twisden who's got this dancy de levis case in and <\s>
<s> he's a well known society lawyer i said of great experience <\s>
<s> he said that is what you do funny the way he speaks <\s>
<s> then i come with you and i've got him in the cab below <\s>
<s> i want to tell you everything before he comes up <\s>
<s> on the way i tried to get something out of him but i couldn't i could not <\s>
<s> this is very awkward i said at last <\s>
<s> it is mr gilman was his reply and he began to talk about his sicilian claret a very good wine mind you but under the circumstances it seemed to me uncalled for <\s>
<s> have i made it clear to you <\s>
<s> who has listened with extreme attention perfectly mr gilman <\s>
<s> i'll send down for him <\s>
<s> he touches a hand bell <\s>
<s> the young clerk appears at the door left forward <\s>
<s> a gentleman in a taxi waiting <\s>
<s> ask him to be so good as to step up <\s>
<s> and send mr graviter here again <\s>
<s> the young clerk goes out <\s>
<s> as i told you sir i've been followin this case <\s>
<s> it's what you might call piquant <\s>
<s> and i should be very glad if it came about that this helped captain dancy <\s>
<s> i take an interest because to tell you the truth confidentially i don't like well not to put too fine a point upon it ebrews <\s>
<s> they work harder they're more sober they're honest and they're everywhere <\s>
<s> i've nothing against them but the fact is they get on so <\s>
<s> cocking an eye a thorn in the flesh mr gilman <\s>
<s> well i prefer my own countrymen and that's the truth of it <\s>
<s> as he speaks graviter comes in by the door left forward <\s>
<s> pointing to the newspaper and the note mr gilman has brought this of which he is holder for value <\s>
<s> his customer who changed it three days ago is coming up <\s>
<s> his face is long and reflective <\s>
<s> entering mr ricardos sir <\s>
<s> ricardos is a personable italian looking man in a frock coat with a dark moustachioed face and dark hair a little grizzled <\s>
<s> he looks anxious and bows <\s>
<s> my name is jacob twisden <\s>
<s> holding up a finger as ricardos would speak mr gilman has told us about this note <\s>
<s> you took it to him he says three days ago that is on monday and received cash for it <\s>
<s> you were not aware that it was stolen <\s>
<s> with his hand to his breast oh <\s>
<s> you received it from <\s>
<s> a minute sare i would weesh to explain with an expressive shrug in private <\s>
<s> nodding mr gilman your conduct has been most prompt <\s>
<s> you may safely leave the matter in our hands now <\s>
<s> kindly let us retain this note and ask for my cashier as you go out and give him he writes this <\s>
<s> he will reimburse you <\s>
<s> we will take any necessary steps ourselves <\s>
<s> in slight surprise with modest pride well sir i'm in your ands <\s>
<s> i must be guided by you with your experience <\s>
<s> i'm glad you think i acted rightly <\s>
<s> very rightly mr gilman very rightly <\s>
<s> to twisden i'm sure i'm very appy to have made your acquaintance sir <\s>
<s> it's a well known name <\s>
<s> gilman retreats glances at ricardos and turns again <\s>
<s> i suppose there's nothing else i ought to do in the interests of the law <\s>
<s> i'm a careful man <\s>
<s> if there is mr gilman we will let you know <\s>
<s> we have your address <\s>
<s> you may make your mind easy but don't speak of this <\s>
<s> it might interfere with justice <\s>
<s> i shouldn't dream of it <\s>
<s> i've no wish to be mixed up in anything conspicuous <\s>
<s> that's not my principle at all <\s>
<s> seating himself now sir will you sit down <\s>
<s> but ricardos does not sit he stands looking uneasily across the table at graviter <\s>
<s> you may speak out <\s>
<s> well mr tweesden and sare this matter is very serious for me and very delicate it concairns my honour <\s>
<s> i am in a great difficulty <\s>
<s> when in difficulty complete frankness sir <\s>
<s> it is a family matter sare i twisden <\s>
<s> let me be frank with you <\s>
<s> telling his points off on his fingers we have your admission that you changed this stopped note for value <\s>
<s> it will be our duty to inform the bank of england that it has been traced to you <\s>
<s> you will have to account to them for your possession of it <\s>
<s> i suggest to you that it will be far better to account frankly to us <\s>
<s> taking out a handkerchief and quite openly wiping his hands and forehead i received this note sare with others from a gentleman sare in settlement of a debt of honour and i know nothing of where he got them <\s>
<s> that is very vague <\s>
<s> if that is all you can tell us i'm afraid ricardos <\s>
<s> gentlemen this is very painful for me <\s>
<s> it is my daughter's good name he again wipes his brow <\s>
<s> come sir speak out <\s>
<s> desperately the notes were a settlement to her from this gentleman of whom she was a great friend <\s>
<s> suddenly i am afraid we must press you for the name of the gentleman <\s>
<s> sare if i give it to you and it does im arm what will my daughter say <\s>
<s> this is a bad matter for me <\s>
<s> he behaved well to her and she is attached to him still sometimes she is crying yet because she lost him <\s>
<s> and now we betray him perhaps who knows <\s>
<s> this is very unpleasant for me <\s>
<s> taking up the paper here it gives the number of another note a undred pound note <\s>
<s> i ave that too <\s>
<s> he takes a note from his breast pocket <\s>
<s> how much did he give you in all <\s>
<s> for my daughter's settlement one thousand pounds <\s>
<s> i understand he did not wish to give a cheque because of his marriage <\s>
<s> so i did not think anything about it being in notes you see <\s>
<s> when did he give you this money <\s>
<s> the middle of octobare last <\s>
<s> suddenly looking up mr ricardos was it captain dancy <\s>
<s> again wiping his forehead gentlemen i am so fond of my daughter <\s>
<s> i have only the one and no wife <\s>
<s> with an effort yes yes but i must know <\s>
<s> sare if i tell you will you give me your good word that my daughter shall not hear of it <\s>
<s> so far as we are able to prevent it certainly <\s>
<s> sare i trust you it was captain dancy <\s>
<s> graviter suddenly were you blackmailing him <\s>
<s> holding up his hand my partner means did you press him for this settlement <\s>
<s> i did think it my duty to my daughter to ask that he make compensation to her <\s>
<s> with threats that you would tell his wife <\s>
<s> with a shrug captain dancy was a man of honour <\s>
<s> he said of course i will do this <\s>
<s> and a month later i did remind him and he gave me this money for her <\s>
<s> i do not know where he got it i do not know <\s>
<s> gentlemen i have invested it all on her every penny except this note for which i had the purpose to buy her a necklace <\s>
<s> that is the sweared truth <\s>
<s> i must keep this note <\s>
<s> he touches the hundred pound note you will not speak of this to anyone <\s>
<s> i may recognise that you were a holder for value received others might take a different view <\s>
<s> graviter see mr ricardos out and take his address <\s>
<s> pressing his hands over the breast of his frock coat with a sigh gentlemen i beg you remember what i said <\s>
<s> with a roll of his eyes my daughter i am not happee <\s>
<s> he turns and goes out slowly left forward followed by graviter <\s>
<s> to himself young dancy <\s>
<s> he pins the two notes together and places them in an envelope then stands motionless except for his eyes and hands which restlessly express the disturbance within him graviter returns carefully shuts the door and going up to him hands him ricardos card <\s>
<s> looking at the card villa benvenuto <\s>
<s> this will have to be verified but i'm afraid it's true <\s>
<s> that man was not acting <\s>
<s> what's to be done about dancy <\s>
<s> can you understand a gentleman <\s>
<s> i don't know sir <\s>
<s> the war loosened form all over the place <\s>
<s> i saw plenty of that myself <\s>
<s> and some men have no moral sense <\s>
<s> from the first i've had doubts <\s>
<s> we can't go on with the case <\s>
<s> a moment's silence gosh <\s>
<s> it's an awful thing for his wife <\s>
<s> graviter touching the envelope chance brought this here sir <\s>
<s> that man won't talk he's too scared <\s>
<s> if de levis got those notes back and the rest of the money anonymously <\s>
<s> but the case graviter the case <\s>
<s> i don't believe this alters what i've been thinking <\s>
<s> thought is one thing knowledge another <\s>
<s> there's duty to our profession <\s>
<s> ours is a fine calling <\s>
<s> on the good faith of solicitors a very great deal hangs <\s>
<s> he crosses to the hearth as if warmth would help him <\s>
<s> it'll let him in for a prosecution <\s>
<s> he came to us in confidence <\s>
<s> not as against the law <\s>
<s> a pause by jove i don't like losing this case <\s>
<s> i don't like the admission we backed such a wrong un <\s>
<s> impossible to go on <\s>
<s> apart from ourselves there's sir frederic <\s>
<s> we must disclose to him can't let him go on in the dark <\s>
<s> complete confidence between solicitor and counsel is the essence of professional honour <\s>

<s> graviter nods i'll be up in time to see dancy <\s>
<s> i feel bad about this <\s>
<s> but professional honour comes first <\s>
<s> what time is that train <\s>
<s> he bends over the abc <\s>
<s> scene ii the same room on the following morning at ten twenty five by the grandfather clock <\s>
<s> the young clerk is ushering in dancy whose face is perceptibly harder than it was three months ago like that of a man who has lived under great restraint <\s>
<s> he wanted to see me before the court sat <\s>
<s> mr twisden will see you in one minute <\s>
<s> he had to go out of town last night <\s>
<s> he prepares to open the waiting room door <\s>
<s> were you in the war <\s>
<s> how can you stick this <\s>
<s> with a smile my trouble was to stick that sir <\s>
<s> but you get no excitement from year's end to year's end <\s>
<s> it'd drive me mad <\s>
<s> shyly a case like this is pretty exciting <\s>
<s> i'd give a lot to see us win it <\s>
<s> staring at him why <\s>
<s> what is it to you <\s>
<s> i don't know sir <\s>
<s> it's it's like football you want your side to win <\s>
<s> he opens the waiting room door <\s>
<s> expanding you see some rum starts too in a lawyer's office in a quiet way <\s>
<s> dancy enters the waiting room and the young clerk shutting the door meets twisden as he comes in left forward and takes from him overcoat top hat and a small bag <\s>
<s> captain dancy's waiting sir <\s>

<s> sorry to have kept you waiting <\s>
<s> entering winsor came to me yesterday about general canynge's evidence <\s>
<s> is that what you wanted to speak to me about <\s>
<s> looking at his wrist watch by me it's just on the half hour sir <\s>
<s> i don't want you to go to the court <\s>
<s> i have very serious news for you <\s>
<s> wincing and collecting himself oh <\s>
<s> he uncovers the notes after the court rose yesterday we had a man called ricardos here <\s>
<s> a pause is there any need for me to say more <\s>
<s> our duty was plain we could not go on with the case <\s>
<s> i have consulted sir frederic <\s>
<s> he felt he felt that he must throw up his brief and he will do that the moment the court sits <\s>
<s> now i want to talk to you about what you're going to do <\s>
<s> that's very good of you considering <\s>
<s> i don't pretend to understand but i imagine you may have done this in a moment of reckless bravado feeling perhaps that as you gave the mare to de levis the money was by rights as much yours as his <\s>
<s> stopping dancy who is about to speak with a gesture <\s>
<s> to satisfy a debt of honour to this lady and no doubt to save your wife from hearing of it from the man ricardos <\s>
<s> it was mad captain dancy mad <\s>
<s> but the question now is what do you owe to your wife <\s>
<s> she doesn't dream i suppose <\s>
<s> with a twitching face no <\s>
<s> we can't tell what the result of this collapse will be <\s>
<s> the police have the theft in hand <\s>
<s> they may issue a warrant <\s>
<s> the money could be refunded and the costs paid somehow that can all be managed <\s>
<s> but it may not help <\s>
<s> in any case what end is served by your staying in the country <\s>
<s> you can't save your honour that's gone <\s>

<s> there's a war in morocco <\s>
<s> with a bitter smile good old morocco <\s>
<s> will you go then at once and leave me to break it to your wife <\s>
<s> i don't know yet <\s>
<s> you must decide quickly to catch a boat train <\s>
<s> many a man has made good <\s>
<s> you're a fine soldier <\s>

<s> mr graviter has come in air with general canynge <\s>
<s> the clerk goes out and almost immediately graviter and canynge enter <\s>
<s> sir frederic got up at once and said that since the publication of the numbers of those notes information had reached him which forced him to withdraw from the case <\s>
<s> great sensation of course <\s>
<s> i left bromley in charge <\s>
<s> there'll be a formal verdict for the defendant with costs <\s>

<s> there's no end to human nature general <\s>

<s> if money's wanted quickly to save proceedings draw on him <\s>
<s> is there anything i can do <\s>
<s> i've advised him to go straight off to morocco <\s>
<s> i don't know that an asylum isn't the place for him <\s>
<s> he must be off his head at moments <\s>
<s> he'd have got a verdict on that alone if they'd seen those balconies <\s>
<s> i was looking at them when i was down there last sunday <\s>
<s> very few men on a dark night he risked his life twice <\s>
<s> that's a shrewd fellow young de levis <\s>

<s> will you see major colford and miss orme <\s>
<s> graviter no show them in <\s>
<s> the young clerk goes <\s>
<s> colford's badly cut up <\s>
<s> margaret orme and colford enter <\s>
<s> striding forward there must be some mistake about this mr twisden <\s>

<s> with emotion if it were my own brother i couldn't feel it more <\s>
<s> what right had that fellow to chuck up the case without letting him know too <\s>
<s> i came down with dancy this morning and he knew nothing about it <\s>
<s> coldly that was unfortunately unavoidable <\s>
<s> guilty or not you ought to have stuck to him it's not playing the game mr twisden <\s>
<s> you must allow me to judge where my duty lay in a very hard case <\s>
<s> i thought a man was safe with his solicitor <\s>
<s> colford you don't understand professional etiquette <\s>
<s> when you have been as long in your profession as i have been in mine major colford you will know that duty to your calling outweighs duty to friend or client <\s>
<s> but i serve the country <\s>

<s> with a sort of darting pride don't mistake me <\s>
<s> i didn't come because i feel christian i am a jew <\s>
<s> i will take no money not even that which was stolen <\s>
<s> give it to a charity <\s>
<s> and now i'm done with the damned thing <\s>
<s> he makes a little bow to canynge and twisden and turns to face dancy who has never moved <\s>

<s> suddenly you heard what he said dancy <\s>

<s> moving towards the door left to the constable who's that out there <\s>
<s> a lady and gentleman sir <\s>
<s> what lady and stand by grover <\s>
<s> you can come in now <\s>
<s> there is the noise of a lock being turned <\s>
<s> and almost immediately the sound of a pistol shot in the bedroom <\s>
<s> mabel rushes to the door tears it open and disappears within followed by the inspector just as margaret orme and colford come in from the passage pursued by the constable <\s>
<s> they too all hurry to the bedroom door and disappear for a moment then colford and margaret reappear supporting mabel who faints as they lay her on the sofa <\s>
<s> colford takes from her hand an envelope and tears it open <\s>

<s> he reads it aloud to margaret in a low voice <\s>
<s> dear colford this is the only decent thing i can do <\s>

<s> sternly yes inspector you've done for my best friend <\s>

<s> grimly you shall have it read at the inquest <\s>

<s> act i the march's dining room opens through french windows on one of those gardens which seem infinite till they are seen to be coterminous with the side walls of the house and finite at the far end because only the thick screen of acacias and sumachs prevents another house from being seen <\s>
<s> the french and other windows form practically all the outer wall of that dining room and between them and the screen of trees lies the difference between the characters of mr and mrs march with dots and dashes of mary and johnny thrown in <\s>
<s> for instance it has been formalised by mrs march but the grass has not been cut by mr march and daffodils have sprung up there which mrs march desires for the dining room but of which mr march says for god's sake joan let them grow <\s>
<s> about half therefore are now in a bowl on the breakfast table and the other half still in the grass in the compromise essential to lasting domesticity <\s>
<s> a hammock under the acacias shows that mary lies there sometimes with her eyes on the gleam of sunlight that comes through and a trail in the longish grass bordered with cigarette ends proves that johnny tramps there with his eyes on the ground or the stars according <\s>
<s> but all this is by the way because except for a yard or two of gravel terrace outside the windows it is all painted on the backcloth <\s>
<s> the marches have been at breakfast and the round table covered with blue linen is thick with remains seven baskets full <\s>
<s> the room is gifted with old oak furniture there is a door stage left forward a hearth where a fire is burning and a high fender on which one can sit stage right middle and in the wall below the fireplace a service hatch covered with a sliding shutter for the passage of dishes into the adjoining pantry <\s>
<s> against the wall stage left is an old oak dresser and a small writing table across the left back corner <\s>
<s> mrs march still sits behind the coffee pot making up her daily list on tablets with a little gold pencil fastened to her wrist <\s>
<s> she is personable forty eight trim well dressed and more matter of fact than seems plausible <\s>
<s> mr march is sitting in an armchair sideways to the windows smoking his pipe and reading his newspaper with little explosions to which no one pays any attention because it is his daily habit <\s>
<s> he is a fine looking man of fifty odd with red grey moustaches and hair both of which stiver partly by nature and partly because his hands often push them up <\s>
<s> mary and johnny are close to the fireplace stage right <\s>
<s> johnny sits on the fender smoking a cigarette and warming his back <\s>
<s> he is a commonplace looking young man with a decided jaw tall neat soulful who has been in the war and writes poetry <\s>
<s> mary is less ordinary you cannot tell exactly what is the matter with her <\s>
<s> she too is tall a little absent fair and well looking <\s>
<s> she has a small china dog in her hand taken from the mantelpiece and faces the audience <\s>
<s> as the curtain rises she is saying in her soft and pleasant voice well what is the matter with us all johnny <\s>
<s> stuck as we were in the trenches like china dogs <\s>
<s> he points to the ornament in her hand mr march <\s>

<s> johnny will you be in to lunch <\s>
<s> johnny shakes his head mary <\s>
<s> into his paper swine <\s>
<s> if you'd just missed being killed for three blooming years for no spiritual result whatever you'd want something to bite on mary <\s>
<s> what price the little and weak now <\s>
<s> freedom and self determination and all that <\s>

<s> it doesn't seem to worry you <\s>
<s> well what's the good <\s>
<s> oh you're a looker on mary <\s>
<s> to his newspaper of all godforsaken time servers <\s>
<s> mary is moved so lar as to turn and look over his shoulder a minute <\s>
<s> this is absolutely prussian <\s>

<s> go to mrs hunt's <\s>
<s> and this fellow hasn't the nous to see that if ever there were a moment when it would pay us to take risks and be generous my hat <\s>
<s> he ought to be knighted <\s>
<s> resumes his paper johnny <\s>
<s> muttering you see even dad can't suggest chivalry without talking of payment for it <\s>
<s> that shows how we've sunk <\s>
<s> chivalry was off even before the war johnny <\s>
<s> of all shallow pated humbug that sneering at chivalry's the worst <\s>
<s> civilisation such as we've got is built on it <\s>
<s> airily then it's built on sand <\s>
<s> she sits beside him on the fender johnny <\s>
<s> roused i'll tell you what johnny it's mucking about with chivalry that makes your poetry rotten <\s>
<s> johnny seizes her arm and twists it shut up that hurts <\s>
<s> johnny twists it more you brute <\s>
<s> johnny lets her arm go johnny <\s>
<s> so you don't mind taking advantage of the fact that you can cheek me with impunity because you're weaker <\s>
<s> you've given the whole show away mary <\s>
<s> abolish chivalry and i'll make you sit up <\s>
<s> what are you two quarrelling about <\s>
<s> will you bring home cigarettes johnny not bogdogunov's mamelukes something more anglo american <\s>
<s> d'you want any more illustrations mary <\s>
<s> she has risen and stands rubbing her arm and recovering her placidity which is considerable mrs march <\s>
<s> geof can you eat preserved peaches <\s>
<s> can you eat preserved peaches <\s>
<s> to his paper making the country stink in the eyes of the world <\s>
<s> mr march wriggles half hearing <\s>
<s> thinking we can do without chivalry <\s>
<s> i'm doing my best to get a parlourmaid to day mary but these breakfast things won't clear themselves <\s>
<s> i'll clear them mother <\s>
<s> at the door knitting silk <\s>

<s> you might make her see stars but never in the singular <\s>
<s> to his paper if god doesn't open the earth soon mary <\s>
<s> is there anything special dad <\s>

<s> there's nobody but cook <\s>
<s> lighting his pipe anywhere <\s>
<s> he slews the armchair towards the fire <\s>
<s> i'll get your things then <\s>
<s> still on the fender what do you say dad <\s>
<s> is civilisation built on chivalry or on self interest <\s>
<s> the question is considerable johnny <\s>
<s> i should say it was built on contract and jerry built at that <\s>
<s> yes but why do we keep contracts when we can break them with advantage and impunity <\s>
<s> but do we keep them <\s>
<s> well say we do; otherwise you'll admit there isn't such a thing as civilisation at all <\s>
<s> but why do we keep them <\s>
<s> for instance why don't we make mary and mother work for us like kafir women <\s>
<s> we could lick them into it <\s>
<s> why did we give women the vote <\s>
<s> why free slaves why anything decent for the little and weak <\s>
<s> well you might say it was convenient for people living in communities <\s>
<s> i don't think it's convenient at all <\s>
<s> i should like to make mary sweat <\s>
<s> why not jungle law if there's nothing in chivalry <\s>
<s> chivalry is altruism johnny <\s>
<s> of course it's quite a question whether altruism isn't enlightened self interest <\s>
<s> the lank and shirt sleeved figure of mr bly with a pail of water and cloths has entered and stands near the window left <\s>
<s> beg pardon mr march d'you mind me cleanin the winders here <\s>
<s> mr bly stares at him and puts his pail down by the window <\s>
<s> mary has entered with her father's writing materials which she puts on a stool beside him <\s>
<s> here you are dad <\s>
<s> i've filled up the ink pot <\s>
<s> she looks curiously at mr bly who has begun operations at the bottom of the left hand window and goes followed by johnny <\s>
<s> relighting his pipe and preparing his materials what do you think of things mr bly <\s>
<s> he looks up at mr bly struck by his large philosophical eyes and moth eaten moustache nor i <\s>
<s> i rather thought that sir from your writin's <\s>

<s> cause enough in the papers <\s>
<s> it's nearer ome with me <\s>
<s> i've often thought i'd like a talk with you sir <\s>
<s> but i'm keepin you <\s>
<s> he prepares to swab the pane mr march <\s>
<s> anything to put off work <\s>
<s> looking at mr march then giving a wipe at the window what's drink to one is drought to another <\s>
<s> i've seen two men take a drink out of the same can one die of it and the other get off with a pain in his stomach <\s>
<s> you've seen a lot i expect <\s>
<s> i've been on the beach in my day <\s>
<s> he sponges at the window it's given me a way o lookin at things that i don't find in other people <\s>
<s> look at the ome office <\s>
<s> they got no philosophy <\s>
<s> pricking his ears what <\s>
<s> have you had dealings with them <\s>
<s> over the reprieve that was got up for my daughter <\s>
<s> but i'm keepin you <\s>
<s> he swabs at the window but always at the same pane so that he does not advance at all <\s>
<s> she was famous at eighteen <\s>
<s> the sunday mercury was full of her when she was in prison <\s>
<s> she's out now been out a fortnight <\s>
<s> i always say that fame's ephemereal <\s>
<s> but she'll never settle to that weavin <\s>
<s> her head got turned a bit <\s>
<s> i'm afraid i'm in the dark mr bly <\s>
<s> pausing dipping his sponge in the pail and then standing with it in his hand why <\s>
<s> don't you remember the bly case <\s>
<s> they sentenced er to be anged by the neck until she was dead for smotherin her baby <\s>
<s> she was only eighteen at the time of speakin <\s>
<s> the jury recommended er to mercy <\s>
<s> so they reduced it to life <\s>
<s> that's what i said so they give her two years <\s>
<s> i don't hold with the sunday mercury but it put that over <\s>
<s> it's a misfortune to a girl to be good lookin <\s>
<s> rumpling his hair no no <\s>
<s> beauty's the only thing left worth living for <\s>
<s> well i like to see green grass and a blue sky but it's a mistake in a uman bein <\s>
<s> look at any young chap that's good lookin' 'e's doomed to the screen or hair dressin <\s>
<s> same with the girls <\s>
<s> my girl went into an airdresser's at seventeen and in six months she was in trouble <\s>
<s> when i saw er with a rope round her neck as you might say i said to meself bly i said you're responsible for this <\s>
<s> if she adn't been good lookin' it'd never eve appened <\s>
<s> during this speech mary has come in with a tray to clear the breakfast and stands unnoticed at the dining table arrested by the curious words of mr bly <\s>
<s> your wife might not have thought that you were wholly the cause mr bly <\s>
<s> but faith that's my girl's name she never was like er mother there's no eredity in er on that side <\s>
<s> what sort of girl is she <\s>
<s> one for colour likes a bit o music likes a dance and a flower <\s>
<s> interrupting softly dad i was going to clear but i'll come back later <\s>
<s> come here and listen to this <\s>
<s> here's a story to get your blood up <\s>
<s> how old was the baby mr bly <\s>
<s> two days 'ardly worth mentionin <\s>
<s> they say she ad the ighstrikes after an when she comes to she says i've saved my baby's life <\s>
<s> an that's true enough when you come to think what that sort o baby goes through as a rule dragged up by somebody else's hand or took away by the law <\s>
<s> what can a workin girl do with a baby born under the rose as they call it <\s>
<s> wonderful the difference money makes when it comes to bein outside the law <\s>
<s> right you are mr bly <\s>
<s> god's on the side of the big battalions <\s>
<s> his eyes roll philosophically did you ever read aigel <\s>
<s> yes with an aitch <\s>
<s> there's a balance abart im that i like <\s>
<s> there's no doubt the christian religion went too far <\s>
<s> turn the other cheek <\s>
<s> an this anti christ neesha what came in with the war he went too far in the other direction <\s>
<s> neither of em practical men <\s>
<s> you've got to strike a balance and foller it <\s>
<s> not much balance about us <\s>
<s> we just run about and jump jim crow <\s>
<s> with a perfunctory wipe that's right we aven't got a faith these days <\s>
<s> but what's the use of tellin the englishman to act like an angel <\s>
<s> he ain't either an angel or a blond beast <\s>
<s> he's between the two an ermumphradite <\s>
<s> take my daughter  if i was a blond beast i'd turn er out to starve if i was an angel i'd starve meself to learn her the piano <\s>
<s> i don't do either <\s>
<s> becos my instincts tells me not <\s>
<s> yes but my doubt is whether our instincts at this moment of the world's history are leading us up or down <\s>
<s> what is up and what is down <\s>
<s> can you answer me that <\s>
<s> is it up or down to get so soft that you can't take care of yourself <\s>
<s> well is it up or down to get so ard that you can't take care of others <\s>
<s> well there you are <\s>
<s> then our instincts are taking us down <\s>
<s> they're strikin a balance unbeknownst all the time <\s>
<s> you're a philosopher mr bly <\s>
<s> modestly well i do a bit in that line too <\s>
<s> in my opinion nature made the individual believe he's goin to live after'e's dead just to keep im livin while es alive otherwise he'd a died out <\s>
<s> quite a thought quite a thought <\s>
<s> but i go one better than nature <\s>
<s> follow your instincts is my motto <\s>
<s> excuse me mr bly i think nature got hold of that before you <\s>
<s> slightly chilled well i'm keepin you <\s>
<s> you're a believer in conscience or the little voice within <\s>
<s> when my son was very small his mother asked him once if he didn't hear a little voice within telling him what was right <\s>
<s> mr march touches his diaphragm and he said i often hear little voices in here but they never say anything <\s>
<s> mr bly cannot laugh but he smiles mary johnny must have been awfully like the government <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact i've got my daughter here in obeyance <\s>
<s> your cook told me you couldn't get hold of an ouse parlour maid <\s>
<s> so i thought it was just a chance you bein broadminded <\s>
<s> what would your mother say mary <\s>
<s> mother would say has she had experience <\s>
<s> i've told you about her experience <\s>
<s> yes but as a parlour maid <\s>
<s> she can do hair <\s>
<s> observing the smile exchanged between mr march and mary and she's quite handy with a plate <\s>
<s> tentatively i'm a little afraid my wife would feel bly <\s>
<s> you see in this weavin shop all the girls ave ad to be in trouble otherwise they wouldn't take em <\s>
<s> apologetically towards mary it's a kind of a disorderly ouse without the disorders <\s>
<s> excusin the young lady's presence <\s>
<s> you needn't mind me mr bly <\s>
<s> and so you want her to come here <\s>
<s> well i remember when she was a little bit of a thing no higher than my knee he holds out his hand mr march <\s>
<s> suddenly moved my god <\s>
<s> they've all been that <\s>
<s> to mary where's your mother <\s>
<s> gone to mrs hunt's <\s>
<s> suppose she's engaged one dad <\s>
<s> well it's only a month's wages <\s>
<s> softly she won't like it <\s>
<s> well let's see her mr bly let's see her if you don't mind <\s>
<s> oh i don't mind sir and she won't neither she's used to bein inspected by now <\s>
<s> she ad her bumps gone over just before she came out <\s>
<s> touched on the raw again h'm <\s>
<s> mary go and fetch her <\s>
<s> mary with a doubting smile goes out <\s>
<s> rising you might give me the details of that trial mr bly <\s>
<s> i'll see if i can't write something that'll make people sit up <\s>
<s> that's the way to send youth to hell <\s>
<s> how can a child who's had a rope round her neck <\s>
<s> who has been fumbling in his pocket produces some yellow paper cuttings clipped together here's her references the whole literature of the case <\s>
<s> and here's a letter from the chaplain in one of the prisons sayin she took a lot of interest in him a nice young man i believe <\s>
<s> he suddenly brushes a tear out of his eye with the back of his hand i never thought i could a felt like i did over her bein in prison <\s>
<s> seemed a crool senseless thing that pretty girl o mine <\s>
<s> all over a baby that hadn't got used to bein alive <\s>
<s> tain't as if she'd been follerin her instincts why she missed that baby something crool <\s>
<s> of course human life even an infant's bly <\s>
<s> i know you've got to ave a close time for it <\s>
<s> but when you come to think how they take uman life in injia and ireland and all those other places it seems ard to come down like a cartload o bricks on a bit of a girl that's been carried away by a moment's abiration <\s>
<s> who is reading the cuttings h'm <\s>
<s> what hypocrites we are <\s>
<s> and oo can tell oo's the father <\s>
<s> she never give us his name <\s>
<s> i think the better of er for that <\s>
<s> shake hands mr bly <\s>
<s> bly wipes his hand and mr march shakes it loyalty's loyalty especially when we men benefit by it <\s>
<s> mary has returned with faith bly who stands demure and pretty on the far side of the table her face an embodiment of the pathetic watchful prison faculty of adapting itself to whatever may be best for its owner at the moment <\s>
<s> at this moment it is obviously best for her to look at the ground and yet to take in the faces of mr march and mary without their taking her face in <\s>
<s> a moment for all of considerable embarrassment <\s>
<s> suddenly we'll here we are <\s>
<s> the remark attracts faith she raises her eyes to his softly with a little smile and drops them again <\s>
<s> so you want to be our parlour maid <\s>
<s> well faith can remove mountains but er i don't know if she can clear tables <\s>
<s> i've been tellin mr march and the young lady what you're capable of <\s>
<s> show em what you can do with a plate <\s>
<s> faith takes the tray from the sideboard and begins to clear the table mainly by the light of nature <\s>
<s> after a glance mr march looks out of the window and drums his fingers on the uncleaned pane <\s>
<s> mr bly goes on with his cleaning <\s>
<s> mary after watching from the hearth goes up and touches her father's arm <\s>
<s> between him and mr bly who is bending over his bucket softly you're not watching dad <\s>
<s> we've got to satisfy mother <\s>
<s> i can satisfy her better if i don't look <\s>
<s> faith has paused a moment and is watching them <\s>
<s> as mary turns she resumes her operations <\s>
<s> mary joins and helps her finish clearing while the two men converse <\s>
<s> fine weather sir for the time of year <\s>
<s> the trees are growing <\s>
<s> i wouldn't be surprised to see a change of government before long <\s>
<s> i've seen uge trees in brazil without any roots seen em come down with a crash <\s>
<s> good image mr bly <\s>
<s> they're all the same butter when they're out of power and blood when they're in <\s>
<s> ow they do abuse other governments for doin the things they do themselves <\s>
<s> excuse me i'll want her dosseer back sir when you've done with it <\s>
<s> he turns rubbing his hands at the cleared table well that seems all right <\s>
<s> and you can do hair <\s>
<s> yes i can do hair <\s>
<s> again that little soft look and smile so carefully adjusted mr march <\s>
<s> that's important don't you think mary <\s>
<s> mary accustomed to candour smiles dubiously brightly ah <\s>
<s> of course if i had the opportunity mary <\s>
<s> feeling a certain awkwardness well i daresay we can find some for you <\s>
<s> can you er be firm on the telephone <\s>
<s> tell them you're engaged when you're not <\s>
<s> let's see mary what else is there <\s>
<s> waiting and house work <\s>
<s> i i'd like to come <\s>
<s> she looks down i don't care for what i'm doing now <\s>
<s> it makes you feel your position <\s>
<s> aren't they nice to you <\s>
<s> yes kind but she looks up it's against my instincts <\s>
<s> quizzically you've got a disciple mr bly <\s>
<s> rolling his eyes at his daughter ah <\s>
<s> but you mustn't ave instincts here you know <\s>
<s> you've got a chance and you must come to stay and do yourself credit <\s>
<s> adapting her face yes i know i'm very lucky <\s>
<s> deprecating thanks and moral precept that's all right <\s>
<s> only mr bly i can't absolutely answer for mrs march <\s>
<s> she may think mary <\s>
<s> there is mother i heard the door <\s>
<s> taking up his pail i quite understand sir i've been a married man myself <\s>
<s> it's very queer the way women look at things <\s>
<s> i'll take her away now and come back presently and do these other winders <\s>
<s> you can talk it over by yourselves <\s>
<s> but if you do see your way sir i shan't forget it in an urry <\s>
<s> to ave the responsibility of her really it's dreadful <\s>
<s> faith's face has grown sullen during this speech but it clears up in another little soft look at mr march as she and mr bly go out <\s>
<s> well mary have i done it <\s>
<s> running his hands through his hair pathetic little figure <\s>
<s> how are you going to put it to mother <\s>
<s> tell her the story and pitch it strong <\s>
<s> we must tell her or she'll think me mad <\s>
<s> she'll do that anyway dear <\s>
<s> he runs his arm through mary's and they sit on the fender at bay <\s>
<s> mrs march enters left <\s>
<s> cheerfully well the fact is mary and i have caught one for you mr bly's daughter mrs march <\s>
<s> are you out of your senses <\s>
<s> don't you know that she's the girl who mr march <\s>
<s> she wants a lift <\s>
<s> well don't we want a maid <\s>
<s> we tested her didn't we mary <\s>
<s> crossing to the bell and ringing you'll just send for mr bly and get rid of her again <\s>
<s> joan if we comfortable people can't put ourselves a little out of the way to give a helping hand mrs march <\s>
<s> to girls who smother their babies <\s>
<s> i won't be a hypocrite and a pharisee <\s>
<s> well for goodness sake let me be one <\s>
<s> as the door opens <\s>
<s> cook stands sixty stout and comfortable with a crumpled smile <\s>
<s> did you ring ma'am <\s>
<s> we're in a moral difficulty cook so naturally we come to you <\s>
<s> impatiently nothing of the sort cook it's a question of common sense <\s>
<s> that girl faith bly wants to come here as parlour maid <\s>
<s> you know her story cook <\s>
<s> i want to give the poor girl a chance <\s>
<s> mrs march thinks it's taking chances <\s>
<s> what do you say <\s>
<s> of course it is a risk sir but there <\s>
<s> you've got to take em to get maids nowadays <\s>
<s> if it isn't in the past it's in the future <\s>
<s> i daresay i could learn er <\s>
<s> it's not her work cook it's her instincts <\s>
<s> a girl who smothered a baby that she oughtn't to have had mr march <\s>
<s> remonstrant if she hadn't had it how could she have smothered it <\s>
<s> soothingly perhaps she's repented ma'am <\s>
<s> of course she's repented <\s>
<s> but did you ever know repentance change anybody cook <\s>
<s> smiling well generally it's a way of gettin ready for the next <\s>
<s> if we never get another chance because we repent cook <\s>
<s> i always think of master johnny ma'am and my jam he used to repent so beautiful dear little feller such a conscience <\s>
<s> i never could bear to lock it away <\s>
<s> i'm surprised at your encouraging the idea i really am <\s>
<s> cook plaits her hands <\s>
<s> cook's been in the family longer than i have haven't you cook <\s>
<s> cook beams she knows much more about a girl like that than we do <\s>
<s> we had a girl like her i remember in your dear mother's time mr geoffrey <\s>
<s> how did she turn out <\s>
<s> well i can't bear behaving like everybody else <\s>
<s> don't you think we might give her a chance cook <\s>
<s> my eart says yes ma'am <\s>
<s> and my ead says no sir <\s>
<s> strike your balance cook <\s>
<s> cook involuntarily draws her joined hands sharply in upon her amplitude <\s>
<s> i didn't catch the little voice within <\s>
<s> ask master johnny sir he's been in the war <\s>
<s> to mary get johnny <\s>
<s> what on earth has the war to do with it <\s>
<s> the things he tells me ma'am is too wonderful for words <\s>

<s> the war destroyed all our ideals and probably created the baby <\s>
<s> it didn't smother it or condemn the girl <\s>

<s> ma'am i never touch a drop <\s>
<s> i didn't mean anything of that sort <\s>

<s> he's the worst of all <\s>
<s> his poetry is nothing but one long explosion <\s>
<s> coming from the window i say we ought to have faith and jump <\s>

<s> drily let me see which of us will have to put up with her shortcomings johnny or i <\s>
<s> she looks quick mother <\s>

<s> i can't understand this passion for vicarious heroism johnny <\s>
<s> well where do you come in <\s>

<s> well dad there was one thing anyway we learned out there when a chap was in a hole to pull him out even at a risk <\s>
<s> there are people who the moment you pull them out jump in again <\s>
<s> we can't tell till we've tried mother <\s>

<s> faith enters and stands beside cook close to the door <\s>
<s> matter of fact in defeat as in victory you want to come to us i hear <\s>
<s> and you don't know much <\s>
<s> softly say ma'am dearie <\s>
<s> cook is going to do her best for you <\s>

<s> with a quick look up yes ma'am <\s>
<s> can you begin at once <\s>
<s> well then cook will show you where things are kept and how to lay the table and that <\s>
<s> your wages will be thirty until we see where we are <\s>

<s> you needn't wear a cap unless you like <\s>
<s> well i hope you'll get on <\s>
<s> i'll leave you with cook now <\s>
<s> after one look at the girl who is standing motionless she goes out <\s>
<s> with a jerk as if coming out of plaster of paris she's never been in prison <\s>
<s> comfortably well my dear we can't all of us go everywhere owever ard we try <\s>
<s> she is standing back to the dresser and turns to it opening the right hand drawer <\s>
<s> now ere's the wine <\s>
<s> the master likes is glass <\s>
<s> and ere's the spirits in the tantaliser tisn't ever kept locked in case master johnny should bring a friend in <\s>
<s> have you noticed master johnny <\s>
<s> he's a dear boy and wonderful high principled since he's been in the war <\s>
<s> he'll come to me sometimes and say cook we're all going to the devil <\s>
<s> they think ighly of im as a poet <\s>
<s> he spoke up for you beautiful <\s>
<s> he spoke up for me <\s>
<s> well of course they had to talk you over <\s>
<s> i wonder if they think i've got feelings <\s>
<s> regarding her moody pretty face why <\s>
<s> we all have feelin's <\s>
<s> not below three hundred a year <\s>
<s> where were you educated <\s>
<s> well it's wonderful what a change there is in girls since my young days pulling out a drawer here's the napkins <\s>
<s> you change the master's every day at least because of his moustache and the others every two days but always clean ones sundays <\s>
<s> did you keep sundays in there <\s>
<s> it'll be a nice change for you here <\s>
<s> they don't go to church they're agnosticals <\s>
<s> patting her shoulder how old are you <\s>
<s> think of that and such a life <\s>
<s> now dearie i'm your friend <\s>
<s> let the present bury the past as the sayin is <\s>
<s> forget all about yourself and you'll be a different girl in no time <\s>
<s> do you want to be a different woman <\s>
<s> cook is taken flat aback by so sudden a revelation of the pharisaism of which she has not been conscious <\s>
<s> opening another dresser drawer here's the vinegar <\s>
<s> and here's the sweets and rather anxiously you mustn't eat them <\s>
<s> i wasn't in for theft <\s>
<s> shocked at such rudimentary exposure of her natural misgivings no no <\s>
<s> but girls have appetites <\s>
<s> they didn't get much chance where i've been <\s>
<s> you must tell me all about it <\s>
<s> did you have adventures <\s>
<s> there isn't such a thing in a prison <\s>
<s> why in the books they're escapin all the time <\s>
<s> but books is books i've always said so <\s>
<s> how were the men <\s>
<s> never saw a man only a chaplain <\s>
<s> they must be quite fresh to you then <\s>
<s> how long was it <\s>
<s> and never a day out <\s>
<s> what did you do all the time <\s>
<s> did they learn you anything <\s>
<s> that's why i hate it <\s>
<s> tell me about your poor little baby <\s>
<s> i'm sure you meant it for the best <\s>
<s> sardonically yes i was afraid they'd make it a ward in chancery <\s>
<s> dear what things do come into your head <\s>
<s> no one can take a baby from its mother <\s>
<s> here's the pickled onions <\s>
<s> miss mary loves em <\s>
<s> now then let me see you lay the cloth <\s>
<s> she takes a tablecloth out hands it to faith and while the girl begins to unfold the cloth she crosses to the service shutter <\s>
<s> and here's where we pass the dishes through into the pantry <\s>
<s> the door is opened and mrs march's voice says cook a minute <\s>
<s> preparing to go salt cellars one at each corner four and the peppers <\s>
<s> from the door now the decanters <\s>
<s> you'll soon get on <\s>
<s> mrs march cook yes ma'am <\s>
<s> faith left alone stands motionless biting her pretty lip her eyes mutinous <\s>
<s> hearing footsteps she looks up <\s>
<s> mr bly with his pail and cloths appears outside <\s>
<s> preparing to work while faith prepares to set the salt cellars so you've got it <\s>
<s> you never know your luck <\s>
<s> up to day and down to morrow <\s>
<s> i'll ave a glass over this to night <\s>
<s> it's not the market price still you're not the market article <\s>
<s> now put a good heart into it and get to know your job you'll find cook full o philosophy if you treat her right she can make a dumplin with anybody <\s>
<s> but look ere you confine yourself to the ladies <\s>
<s> i don't want your advice father <\s>
<s> i know parents are out of date still i've put up with a lot on your account so gimme a bit of me own back <\s>
<s> i don't know whether i shall like this <\s>
<s> i've been shut up so long <\s>
<s> i want to see some life <\s>
<s> but i want you to do well <\s>
<s> i suppose you'll be comin ome to fetch your things to night <\s>
<s> i'll have a flower for you <\s>
<s> no one with a scent to it <\s>
<s> i'll ask at mrs bean's round the corner <\s>
<s> she'll pick em out from what's over <\s>
<s> never ad much nose for a flower meself <\s>
<s> i often thought you'd like a flower when you was in prison <\s>
<s> a little touched did you <\s>
<s> i suppose i've drunk more glasses over your bein in there than over anything that ever appened to me <\s>
<s> i couldn't relish the war for it <\s>
<s> and i suppose you ad none to relish <\s>
<s> so put an eart into it <\s>
<s> there's compensation for everything aigel says <\s>
<s> at least if it wasn't aigel it was one o the others <\s>
<s> i'll move on to the study now <\s>
<s> he's got some winders there lookin right over the country <\s>
<s> and a wonderful lot o books if you feel inclined for a read one of these days <\s>
<s> faith sets down the salt cellar in her hand puts her tongue out a very little and goes out into the hall <\s>
<s> mr bly is gathering up his pail and cloths when mr march enters at the window <\s>
<s> so it's fixed up mr bly <\s>
<s> raising himself i'd like to shake your and sir <\s>
<s> they shake hands it's a great weight off my mind <\s>
<s> it's rather a weight on my wife's i'm afraid <\s>
<s> but we must hope for the best <\s>
<s> the country wants rain but i doubt if we shall get it with this government <\s>
<s> we want the good old times when you could depend on the seasons <\s>
<s> the further you look back the more dependable the times get ave you noticed that sir <\s>
<s> suddenly suppose they'd hanged your daughter mr bly <\s>
<s> what would you have done <\s>
<s> well to be quite frank i should ave got drunk on it <\s>
<s> public opinion's always in advance of the law <\s>
<s> i think your daughter's a most pathetic little figure <\s>
<s> her looks are against her <\s>
<s> i never found a man that didn't <\s>
<s> a little disconcerted well we'll try and give her a good show here <\s>
<s> taking up his pail i'm greatly obliged she'll appreciate anything you can do for her <\s>
<s> he moves to the door and pauses there to say fact is her winders wants cleanin she ad a dusty time in there <\s>
<s> i'm sure she had <\s>
<s> mr bly passes out and mr march busies himself in gathering up his writing things preparatory to seeking his study <\s>
<s> while he is so engaged faith comes in <\s>
<s> glancing at him she resumes her placing of the decanters as johnny enters by the window and comes down to his father by the hearth <\s>
<s> privately if you haven't begun your morning dad you might just tell me what you think of these verses <\s>
<s> he puts a sheet of notepaper before his father who takes it and begins to con over the verses thereon while johnny looks carefully at his nails <\s>
<s> er i i like the last line awfully johnny <\s>
<s> gloomily what about the other eleven <\s>
<s> tentatively well old man i er think perhaps it'd be stronger if they were out <\s>
<s> he takes back the sheet of paper clutches his brow and crosses to the door <\s>
<s> as he passes faith she looks up at him with eyes full of expression <\s>
<s> johnny catches the look jibs ever so little and goes out <\s>
<s> through the door which is still ajar faith <\s>
<s> faith puts the decanters on the table and goes quickly out <\s>
<s> who has seen this little by play to himself in a voice of dismay oh <\s>
<s> act ii a fortnight later in the march's dining room a day of violent april showers <\s>
<s> lunch is over and the table littered with remains twelve baskets full <\s>
<s> mr march and mary have lingered <\s>
<s> mr march is standing by the hearth where a fire is burning filling a fountain pen <\s>
<s> mary sits at the table opposite pecking at a walnut <\s>
<s> examining his fingers what it is to have an inky present <\s>
<s> suffer with me mary <\s>
<s> weep ye no more sad fountains <\s>
<s> why need ye flow so fast <\s>
<s> pocketing his pen coming with me to the british museum <\s>
<s> i want to have a look at the assyrian reliefs <\s>
<s> dad have you noticed johnny <\s>
<s> then only mother hasn't <\s>
<s> i've always found your mother extremely good at seeming not to notice things mary <\s>
<s> she's got on very fast this fortnight <\s>
<s> the glad eye mary <\s>
<s> i got it that first morning <\s>
<s> johnny got it and i got him getting it <\s>
<s> what are you going to do about it <\s>
<s> what does one do with a glad eye that belongs to some one else <\s>
<s> but seriously dad johnny's not like you and me <\s>
<s> why not speak to mr bly <\s>
<s> mr bly's eyes are not glad <\s>
<s> johnny's capable of anything except a sense of humour <\s>
<s> the girl's past makes it impossible to say anything to her <\s>
<s> well i warn you <\s>
<s> johnny's very queer just now he's in the lose the world to save your soul mood <\s>
<s> it really is too bad of that girl <\s>
<s> after all we did what most people wouldn't <\s>
<s> get your hat on mary or we shan't make the tube before the next shower <\s>
<s> going to the door something must be done <\s>
<s> as you say something ah <\s>
<s> mr bly in precisely the same case as a fortnight ago with his pail and cloths is coming in <\s>
<s> shall i be disturbing you if i do the winders here <\s>
<s> mr bly crosses to the windows <\s>
<s> pointing to mr bly's back try <\s>
<s> very tryin for winders <\s>
<s> resting my daughter givin satisfaction i hope <\s>
<s> with difficulty er in her work i believe coming on well <\s>
<s> but the question is mr bly do er any of us ever really give satisfaction except to ourselves <\s>
<s> taking it as an invitation to his philosophical vein ah <\s>
<s> that's one as goes to the roots of uman nature <\s>
<s> there's a lot of disposition in all of us <\s>
<s> and what i always say is one man's disposition is another man's indisposition <\s>
<s> just hits the mark <\s>
<s> filling his sponge question is how far are you to give rein to your disposition <\s>
<s> when i was in durban natal i knew a man who had the biggest disposition i ever come across <\s>
<s> e struck is wife e smoked opium e was a liar e gave all the rein e could and yet withal one of the pleasantest men i ever met <\s>
<s> perhaps in giving rein he didn't strike you <\s>
<s> with a big wipe following his thought he said to me once joe he said if i was to hold meself in i should be a devil <\s>
<s> there's where you get it <\s>
<s> cab'net ministers any one who leads an unnatural life see how it twists em <\s>
<s> you can't suppress a thing without it swellin you up in another place <\s>
<s> and the moral of that is <\s>
<s> you see if i'm not keepin you now that we ain't got no faith as we were sayin the other day no ten commandments in black an white we've just got to be uman bein's raisin cain and havin feelin hearts <\s>
<s> what's the use of all these lofty ideas that you can't live up to <\s>
<s> liberty fraternity equality democracy see what comes o fightin for em <\s>
<s> ere we are wipin out the lot <\s>
<s> we thought they was fixed stars they was only comets hot air <\s>
<s> no trust uman nature i say and follow your instincts <\s>
<s> we were talking of your daughter i i bly <\s>
<s> there's a case in point <\s>
<s> her instincts was starved goin on for three years because mind you they kept her hangin about in prison months before they tried her <\s>
<s> i read your article and i thought to meself after i'd finished which would i feel smallest if i was the judge the jury or the ome secretary <\s>
<s> it was a treat that article <\s>
<s> they ought to abolish that in'uman to be hanged by the neck until she is dead <\s>
<s> it's my belief they only keep it because it's poetry that and the wigs they're hard up for a bit of beauty in the courts of law <\s>
<s> excuse my and sir i do thank you for that article <\s>
<s> he extends his wiped hand which mr march shakes with the feeling that he is always shaking mr <\s>
<s> but apropos of your daughter mr bly <\s>
<s> i suppose none of us ever change our natures <\s>
<s> again responding to the appeal that he senses to his philosophical vein ah <\s>
<s> but oo can see what our natures are <\s>
<s> why i've known people that could see nothin but theirselves and their own families unless they was drunk <\s>
<s> at my daughter's trial i see right into the lawyers judge and all <\s>
<s> there she was hub of the whole thing and all they could see of her was ow far she affected em personally one tryin to get er guilty the other tryin to get er off and the judge summin er up cold blooded <\s>
<s> but that's what they're paid for mr bly <\s>
<s> but which of em was thinkin ere's a little bit o warm life on its own <\s>
<s> ere's a little dancin creature <\s>
<s> what's she feelin wot's er complaint impersonal like <\s>
<s> i like to see a man do a bit of speculatin with his mind off of imself for once <\s>
<s> the man that hath not speculation in his soul <\s>
<s> when i see a mangy cat or a dog that's lost or a fellow creature down on his luck i always try to put meself in his place <\s>
<s> it's a weakness i've got <\s>
<s> warmly a deuced good one <\s>
<s> shake he checks himself but mr bly has wiped his hand and extended it <\s>
<s> while the shake is in progress mary returns and having seen it to a safe conclusion speaks <\s>
<s> excuse me mr bly i must away <\s>
<s> he goes towards the door and bly dips his sponge <\s>
<s> in a low voice well <\s>
<s> mr bly is like all the greater men i know he can't listen <\s>
<s> but you were shaking mr march <\s>
<s> yes it's a weakness we have every three minutes <\s>
<s> as they go out mr bly pauses in his labours to catch as it were a philosophical reflection <\s>
<s> he resumes the wiping of a pane while quietly behind him faith comes in with a tray <\s>
<s> she is dressed now in lilac coloured linen without a cap and looks prettier than ever <\s>
<s> she puts the tray down on the sideboard with a clap that attracts her father's attention and stands contemplating the debris on the table <\s>
<s> all sorts all round yer <\s>
<s> eight times a day four times for them and four times for us <\s>
<s> she puts a chocolate into her mouth <\s>
<s> i might just as well hate me winders <\s>
<s> she begins to clear <\s>
<s> regarding her look ere my girl <\s>
<s> don't you forget that there ain't many winders in london out o which they look as philosophical as these here <\s>
<s> beggars can't be choosers <\s>
<s> don't go on at me <\s>
<s> they spoiled your disposition in that place i'm afraid <\s>
<s> try it and see what they do with yours <\s>
<s> well i may come to it yet <\s>
<s> you'll get no windows to look out of there a little bit of a thing with bars to it and lucky if it's not thick glass <\s>
<s> standing still and gazing past mr bly no sun no trees no faces people don't pass in the sky not even angels <\s>
<s> but you shouldn't brood over it <\s>
<s> i knew a man in valpiraso that ad spent arf is life in prison a jolly feller i forget what e'd done somethin bloody <\s>
<s> i want to see you like him <\s>
<s> aren't you happy here <\s>
<s> it's right enough so long as i get out <\s>
<s> this mr march he's like all these novel writers thinks e knows uman nature but of course e don't <\s>
<s> still i can talk to im got an open mind and hates the gover'ment <\s>
<s> that's the two great things <\s>
<s> mrs march so far as i see as got her head screwed on much tighter <\s>
<s> what's the young man like <\s>
<s> he's a long feller <\s>
<s> with a shrug and a little smile johnny <\s>
<s> well that gives a very good idea of him <\s>
<s> they say es a poet does e leave em about <\s>
<s> i've seen one or two <\s>
<s> all about the condition of the world and the moon <\s>
<s> and the young lady <\s>
<s> faith shrugs her shoulders <\s>
<s> um 'ts what i thought <\s>
<s> she asn't moved much with the times <\s>
<s> she thinks she as but she asn't <\s>
<s> well they seem a pleasant family <\s>
<s> leave you to yourself <\s>
<s> more body than mind <\s>
<s> still you get out don't you <\s>
<s> with a slow smile yes <\s>
<s> she gives a sudden little twirl and puts her hands up to her hair before the mirror my afternoon to day <\s>
<s> it's fine in the streets after being in there <\s>
<s> don't follow your instincts too much that's all <\s>
<s> i must get on to the drawin room now <\s>
<s> there's a shower comin <\s>
<s> philosophically it's ardly worth while to do these winders <\s>
<s> you clean em and they're dirty again in no time <\s>
<s> and people talk o progress <\s>
<s> of course there ain't progress it's a world without end affair <\s>
<s> you've got to make up your mind to it and not be discouraged <\s>
<s> all this depression comes from avin igh opes <\s>
<s> ave low opes and you'll be all right <\s>
<s> he takes up his pail and cloths and moves out through the windows <\s>
<s> faith puts another chocolate into her mouth and taking up a flower twirls round with it held to her nose and looks at herself in the glass over the hearth <\s>
<s> she is still looking at herself when she sees in the mirror a reflection of johnny who has come in <\s>
<s> her face grows just a little scared as if she had caught the eye of a warder peering through the peep hole of her cell door then brazens and slowly sweetens as she turns round to him <\s>
<s> he has a pipe in his hand and wears a norfolk jacket fond of flowers <\s>
<s> she puts back the flower ever so <\s>
<s> put it in your hair it'll look jolly <\s>
<s> how do you like it here <\s>
<s> i wonder if you've got the feeling i have <\s>
<s> we've both had hell you know i had three years of it out there and you've had three years of it here <\s>
<s> the feeling that you can't catch up can't live fast enough to get even <\s>
<s> nothing's big enough nothing's worth while enough is it <\s>
<s> i know i'd like to bite <\s>
<s> she draws her lips back <\s>
<s> tell me all about your beastly time it'll do you good <\s>
<s> you and i are different from anybody else in this house <\s>
<s> we've lived they've just vegetated <\s>
<s> come on tell me <\s>
<s> faith who up to now has looked on him as a young male stares at him for the first time without sex in her eyes <\s>
<s> we didn't talk in there you know <\s>
<s> were you fond of the chap who <\s>
<s> i suppose i was once <\s>
<s> he must have been rather a swine <\s>
<s> i've forgotten all that <\s>
<s> beastly things babies and absolutely unnecessary in the present state of the world <\s>
<s> with a faint smile my baby wasn't beastly but i i got upset <\s>
<s> well i should think so <\s>
<s> my friend in the manicure came and told me about hers when i was lying in the hospital <\s>
<s> she couldn't have it with her so it got neglected and died <\s>
<s> i believe that's quite common <\s>
<s> and she told me about another girl the law took her baby from her <\s>
<s> and after she was gone i got all worked up she hesitates then goes swiftly on and i looked at mine it was asleep just here quite close <\s>
<s> i just put out my arm like that over its face quite soft i didn't hurt it <\s>
<s> she suddenly swallows and her lips quiver i didn't feel anything under my arm <\s>
<s> and and a beast of a nurse came on me and said you've smothered your baby you wretched girl <\s>
<s> i didn't want to kill it i only wanted to save it from living <\s>
<s> and when i looked at it i went off screaming <\s>
<s> i nearly screamed when i saved my first german from living <\s>
<s> i never felt the same again <\s>
<s> they say the human race has got to go on but i say they've first got to prove that the human race wants to <\s>
<s> would you rather be alive or dead <\s>
<s> but would you have in prison <\s>
<s> you can't tell anything in there <\s>
<s> with sudden vehemence i wish i had my baby back though <\s>
<s> it was mine and i i don't like thinking about it <\s>
<s> i hate to think about anything i've killed really <\s>
<s> at least i should but it's better not to think <\s>
<s> i could have killed that judge <\s>
<s> did he come the heavy father <\s>
<s> that's what i can't stand <\s>
<s> when they jaw a chap and hang him afterwards <\s>
<s> or was he one of the joking ones <\s>
<s> i've sat in my cell and cried all night night after night i have <\s>
<s> with a little laugh i cried all the softness out of me <\s>
<s> you never believed they were going to hang you did you <\s>
<s> i didn't care if they did not then <\s>
<s> with a reflective grunt you had a much worse time than i <\s>
<s> you were lonely faith <\s>
<s> have you been in a prison ever <\s>
<s> and it's stone cold <\s>
<s> it turns your heart <\s>
<s> did you ever see a stalactite <\s>
<s> the water drops like tears and each drop has some sort of salt and leaves it behind till there's just a long salt petrified drip hanging from the roof <\s>
<s> staring at him i used to stand behind my door <\s>
<s> i'd stand there sometimes i don't know how long <\s>
<s> i'd listen and listen the noises are all hollow in a prison <\s>
<s> you'd think you'd get used to being shut up but i never did <\s>
<s> johnny utters a deep grunt <\s>
<s> it's awful the feeling you get here so tight and chokey <\s>
<s> people who are free don't know what it's like to be shut up <\s>
<s> if i'd had a proper window even when you can see things living it makes you feel alive <\s>
<s> catching her arm we'll make you feel alive again <\s>

<s> i bet you used to enjoy life before <\s>
<s> clasping her hands oh <\s>
<s> and i love getting out now <\s>
<s> i've got a fr she checks herself the streets are beautiful aren't they <\s>
<s> do you know orleens street <\s>
<s> at the corner out of the regent <\s>
<s> that's where we had our shop <\s>
<s> i liked the hair dressing <\s>
<s> perhaps i've seen you before <\s>
<s> did you ever come in there <\s>
<s> i'd go back there only they wouldn't take me i'm too conspicuous now <\s>
<s> i expect you're well out of that <\s>
<s> with a sigh but i did like it <\s>
<s> we had an hour off in the middle of the day you could go where you liked and then after hours i love the streets at night all lighted <\s>
<s> olga that's one of the other girls and i used to walk about for hours <\s>
<s> i never saw a street for more than two years <\s>
<s> didn't you miss them in the war <\s>
<s> i missed grass and trees more the trees <\s>
<s> all burnt and splintered <\s>
<s> yes i like trees too anything beautiful you know <\s>
<s> i think the parks are lovely but they might let you pick the flowers <\s>
<s> but the lights are best really they make you feel happy <\s>
<s> and music i love an organ <\s>
<s> there was one used to come and play outside the prison before i was tried <\s>
<s> it sounded so far away and lovely <\s>
<s> if i could ave met the man that played that organ i'd have kissed him <\s>
<s> d'you think he did it on purpose <\s>
<s> he would have if he'd been me <\s>
<s> he says it unconsciously but faith is instantly conscious of the implication <\s>
<s> he'd rather have had pennies though <\s>
<s> it's all earning working and earning <\s>
<s> i wish i were like the flowers <\s>
<s> she twirls the dower in her hand flowers don't work and they don't get put in prison <\s>
<s> putting his arm round her never mind <\s>
<s> you're only a kid <\s>
<s> you'll have a good time yet <\s>
<s> faith leans against him as it were indifferently clearly expecting him to kiss her but he doesn't <\s>
<s> when i was a little girl i had a cake covered with sugar <\s>
<s> i ate the sugar all off and then i didn't want the cake not much <\s>
<s> suddenly removing his arm gosh <\s>
<s> if i could write a poem that would show everybody what was in the heart of everybody else <\s>
<s> it'd be too long for the papers wouldn't it <\s>
<s> it'd be too strong <\s>
<s> besides you don't know <\s>
<s> her eyelids go up <\s>
<s> staring at her i could tell what's in you now <\s>
<s> you feel like a flower that's been picked <\s>
<s> faith's smile is enigmatic <\s>
<s> suddenly why do you go on about me so <\s>
<s> because you're weak little and weak <\s>
<s> breaking out again damn it <\s>
<s> we went into the war to save the little and weak at least we said so and look at us now <\s>
<s> the bottom's out of all that <\s>
<s> bitterly there isn't a faith or an illusion left <\s>
<s> i want to help you <\s>
<s> surprisingly my baby was little and weak <\s>
<s> you never meant you didn't do it for your own advantage <\s>
<s> it didn't know it was alive <\s>
<s> suddenly d'you think i'm pretty <\s>
<s> then you'd better keep away hadn't you <\s>

<s> i can trust myself <\s>
<s> turning to the window through which can be seen the darkening of a shower it's raining <\s>
<s> father says windows never stay clean <\s>

<s> her astounded head and shoulders pass into view just as faith suddenly puts up her face <\s>
<s> johnny's lips hesitate then move towards her forehead <\s>
<s> but her face shifts and they find themselves upon her lips <\s>
<s> once there the emphasis cannot help but be considerable <\s>
<s> cook's mouth falls open <\s>
<s> she closes the shutter vanishing <\s>
<s> breaking away look here <\s>
<s> i didn't mean i oughtn't to have please forget it <\s>
<s> with a little smile didn't you like it <\s>
<s> i didn't mean to it won't do <\s>
<s> it's just the opposite of what no no <\s>
<s> he goes to the door wrenches it open and goes out <\s>
<s> faith still with that little half mocking half contented smile resumes the clearing of the table <\s>
<s> she is interrupted by the entrance through the french windows of mr march and mary struggling with one small wet umbrella <\s>
<s> feeling his sleeve go and change dad <\s>
<s> we could have made the tube but for your shoes <\s>
<s> it was your cold feet not mine dear <\s>
<s> looking at faith and nudging him now <\s>
<s> she goes towards the door turns to look at faith still clearing the table and goes out <\s>
<s> in front of the hearth nasty spring weather faith <\s>
<s> still in the mood of the kiss yes sir <\s>
<s> sotto voce in the spring a young man's fancy <\s>
<s> i i wanted to say something to you in a friendly way <\s>
<s> faith regards him as he struggles on <\s>
<s> because i feel very friendly towards you <\s>
<s> so you won't take what i say in bad part <\s>
<s> after what you've been through any man with a sense of chivalry faith gives a little shrug <\s>
<s> yes i know but we don't all support the government <\s>
<s> i don't know anything about the government <\s>
<s> side tracked on to his hobby ah i forgot <\s>
<s> you saw no newspapers <\s>
<s> but you ought to pick up the threads now <\s>
<s> what paper does cook take <\s>
<s> i don't seem what are its politics <\s>
<s> it hasn't any only funny bits and fashions <\s>
<s> it's full of corsets <\s>
<s> what does cook want with corsets <\s>
<s> she likes to think she looks like that <\s>
<s> let's see er i was speaking of chivalry <\s>
<s> my son you know er my son has got it <\s>
<s> suddenly alive to the fact that she is playing with him i started by being sorry for you <\s>
<s> aren't you any more <\s>
<s> look here my child <\s>
<s> faith looks up at him <\s>
<s> protectingly we want to do our best for you <\s>
<s> now don't spoil it by well you know <\s>
<s> suddenly suppose you'd been stuffed away in a hole for years <\s>
<s> side tracked again just what your father said <\s>
<s> the more i see of mr bly the more wise i think him <\s>
<s> what sort of bringing up did he give you <\s>
<s> faith smiles wryly and shrugs her shoulders <\s>
<s> here comes the sun again <\s>
<s> taking up the flower which is lying on the table may i have this flower <\s>
<s> you can always take what flowers you like that is if er faith <\s>
<s> if mrs march isn't about <\s>
<s> i meant if it doesn't spoil the look of the table <\s>
<s> we must all be artists in our professions mustn't we <\s>
<s> my profession was cutting hair <\s>
<s> i would like to cut yours <\s>
<s> mr march's hands instinctively go up to it <\s>
<s> you mightn't think it but i'm talking to you seriously <\s>
<s> out of his depth well <\s>
<s> i got wet i must go and change <\s>
<s> faith follows him with her eyes as he goes out and resumes the clearing of the table <\s>
<s> she has paused and is again smelling at the flower when she hears the door and quickly resumes her work <\s>
<s> it is mrs march who comes in and goes to the writing table left back without looking at faith <\s>
<s> she sits there writing a cheque while faith goes on clearing <\s>
<s> suddenly in an unruffled voice i have made your cheque out for four pounds <\s>
<s> it's rather more than the fortnight and a month's notice <\s>
<s> there'll be a cab for you in an hour's time <\s>
<s> can you be ready by then <\s>
<s> do you wish for the reason <\s>
<s> cook saw you just now <\s>
<s> i didn't mean her to <\s>
<s> now go and pack up your things <\s>
<s> he asked me to be a friend to him <\s>
<s> he said he was lonely here <\s>
<s> cook saw you kissing him with p p faith <\s>
<s> quickly not with pep <\s>
<s> i was going to say passion <\s>
<s> where am i to go <\s>
<s> you will have four pounds and you can get another place <\s>
<s> that's hardly my affair <\s>
<s> tossing her head all right <\s>
<s> i'll speak to your father if he isn't gone <\s>
<s> why do you send me away just for a kiss <\s>
<s> desperately he wanted to to save me <\s>
<s> you know perfectly well people can only save themselves <\s>
<s> i don't care for your son i've got a young she checks herself i i'll leave your son alone if he leaves me <\s>
<s> mrs march rings the bell on the table <\s>
<s> she moves towards the door <\s>
<s> suddenly holding out the flower mr march gave me that flower would you like it back <\s>
<s> if you want more money till you get a place let me know <\s>
<s> i won't trouble you <\s>
<s> mrs march goes to the window and drums her fingers on the pane <\s>
<s> cook if mr bly's still here i want to see him <\s>
<s> and it's three now <\s>
<s> have a cab at four o'clock <\s>
<s> almost tearful oh ma'am anybody but master johnny and i'd ave been a deaf an dummy <\s>
<s> she's not responsive i daresay <\s>
<s> suppose i was to speak to master johnny <\s>
<s> he's done his windows he's just waiting for his money <\s>
<s> then get him and take that tray <\s>
<s> i remember the master kissin me when he was a boy <\s>
<s> but then he never meant anything so different from master johnny <\s>
<s> master johnny takes things to eart <\s>
<s> there's not an ounce of vice in im <\s>
<s> it's all his goodness dear little feller <\s>
<s> that's the danger with a girl like that <\s>
<s> it's eatin hearty all of a sudden that's made her poptious <\s>
<s> but there ma'am try her again <\s>
<s> master johnny'll be so cut up <\s>
<s> no playing with fire cook <\s>
<s> we were foolish to let her come <\s>
<s> dear he will be angry with me <\s>
<s> if you hadn't been in the kitchen and heard me ma'am i'd ha let it pass <\s>
<s> that would have been very wrong of you <\s>
<s> but i'd do a lot of wrong things for master johnny <\s>
<s> there's always some one you'll go wrong for <\s>
<s> well get mr bly and take that tray there's a good soul <\s>
<s> cook goes out with the tray and while waiting mrs march finishes clearing the table <\s>
<s> she has not quite finished when mr bly enters <\s>
<s> with embarrassment i'm very sorry mr bly but circumstances over which i have no control bly <\s>
<s> we all has them <\s>
<s> the winders ought to be done once a week now the spring's on em <\s>
<s> no no it's your daughter bly <\s>
<s> deeply not been given way to'er instincts i do trust <\s>
<s> i've just had to say good bye to her <\s>
<s> very blank nothing to do with property i hope <\s>
<s> giddiness with my son <\s>
<s> it's impossible she really must learn <\s>
<s> but oo's to learn er <\s>
<s> couldn't you learn your son instead <\s>
<s> my son is very high minded <\s>
<s> how am i goin to get over this <\s>
<s> shall i tell you what i think ma'am <\s>
<s> i'm afraid it'll be no good <\s>
<s> character's born not made <\s>
<s> you can clean yer winders and clean em but that don't change the colour of the glass <\s>
<s> my father would have given her a good hidin but i shan't <\s>
<s> because my glass ain't as thick as his <\s>
<s> i see through it i see my girl's temptations i see what she is likes a bit o life likes a flower an a dance <\s>
<s> she's a natural morganatic <\s>
<s> nothin'll ever make her regular <\s>
<s> mr march'll understand how i feel <\s>
<s> in the mud again <\s>
<s> well we must keep smilin <\s>
<s> his face is as long as his arm the poor ave their troubles there's no doubt <\s>
<s> he turns to go there's nothin can save her but money so as she can do as she likes <\s>
<s> then she wouldn't want to do it <\s>
<s> i'm very sorry but there it is <\s>
<s> and i thought she was goin to be a success here <\s>
<s> fact is you can't see anything till it appens <\s>
<s> there's winders all round but you can't see <\s>
<s> follow your instincts it's the only way <\s>
<s> it hasn't helped your daughter <\s>
<s> i was speakin philosophic <\s>
<s> well i'll go ome now and prepare meself for the worst <\s>
<s> has cook given you your money <\s>
<s> he goes out gloomily and is nearly overthrown in the doorway by the violent entry of johnny <\s>
<s> i won't have it it's pre war <\s>
<s> indicating mr bly johnny <\s>
<s> johnny waves bly out of the room and doses the door <\s>
<s> i won't have her go <\s>
<s> she's a pathetic little creature <\s>
<s> unruffled she's a minx <\s>
<s> now johnny be sensible <\s>
<s> she's a very pretty girl and this is my house <\s>
<s> of course you think the worst <\s>
<s> trust anyone who wasn't in the war for that <\s>
<s> i don't think either the better or the worse <\s>
<s> mother you're like the papers you put in all the vice and leave out all the virtue and call that human nature <\s>
<s> the kiss was an accident that i bitterly regret <\s>
<s> johnny how can you <\s>
<s> you know what i mean <\s>
<s> i regret it with my my conscience <\s>
<s> it shan't occur again <\s>
<s> mother you make me despair <\s>
<s> you're so matter of fact you never give one credit for a pure ideal <\s>
<s> i know where ideals lead <\s>
<s> and the purer they are the hotter the soup <\s>
<s> and you married father <\s>
<s> well that girl is not to be chucked out won't have her on my chest <\s>
<s> that's why she's going johnny <\s>
<s> mrs march looks at him from across the dining table for he has marched up to it till they are staring at each other across the now cleared rosewood <\s>
<s> how are you going to stop her <\s>
<s> oh i'll stop her right enough <\s>
<s> if i stuck it out in hell i can stick it out in highgate <\s>
<s> i've watched this girl and i don't watch what i want to see like your father i watch what is <\s>
<s> she's not a hard case yet but she will be <\s>
<s> because all you matter of fact people make up your minds to it <\s>
<s> what earthly chance has she had <\s>
<s> there are such things you know johnny <\s>
<s> she's a little creature who went down in the scrum and has been kicked about ever since <\s>
<s> i'll give her money if you'll keep her at arm's length <\s>
<s> i call that revolting <\s>
<s> what she wants is the human touch <\s>
<s> i've not a doubt of it <\s>
<s> johnny rises in disgust <\s>
<s> johnny what is the use of wrapping the thing up in catchwords <\s>
<s> a young man like you never saved a girl like her <\s>
<s> it's as fantastic as as tolstoi's resurrection <\s>
<s> tolstoi was the most truthful writer that ever lived <\s>
<s> tolstoi was a russian always proving that what isn't is <\s>
<s> russians are charitable anyway and see into other people's souls <\s>
<s> that's why they're hopeless <\s>
<s> well for cynicism mrs march <\s>
<s> it's at least as important johnny to see into ourselves as into other people <\s>
<s> i've been trying to make your father understand that ever since we married <\s>
<s> he'd be such a good writer if he did he wouldn't write at all <\s>
<s> and no business to meddle with practical affairs <\s>
<s> you and he always ride in front of the hounds <\s>
<s> do you remember when the war broke out how angry you were with me because i said we were fighting from a sense of self preservation <\s>
<s> that's what i'm doing now anyway <\s>
<s> saving this girl to save yourself <\s>
<s> i must have something decent to do sometimes <\s>
<s> there isn't an ideal left <\s>
<s> if you knew how tired i am of the word johnny <\s>
<s> there are thousands who feel like me that the bottom's out of everything <\s>
<s> it sickens me that anything in the least generous should get sat on by all you people who haven't risked your lives <\s>
<s> with a smile i risked mine when you were born johnny <\s>
<s> you were always very difficult <\s>
<s> that girl's been telling me i can see the whole thing <\s>
<s> the fact that she suffered doesn't alter her nature or the danger to you and us <\s>
<s> there is no danger i told her i didn't mean it <\s>
<s> if you were ordinary johnny it would be the girl's look out <\s>
<s> but you're not and i'm not going to have you in the trap she'll set for you <\s>
<s> you think she's a designing minx <\s>
<s> i tell you she's got no more design in her than a rabbit <\s>
<s> she's just at the mercy of anything <\s>
<s> she'll play on your feelings and you'll be caught <\s>
<s> i'm not a baby <\s>
<s> you are and she'll smother you <\s>
<s> how beastly women are to each other <\s>
<s> we know ourselves you see <\s>
<s> the girl's father realises perfectly what she is <\s>
<s> mr bly is a dodderer <\s>
<s> and she's got no mother <\s>
<s> i'll bet you've never realised the life girls who get outed lead <\s>
<s> i've seen them i saw them in france <\s>
<s> it gives one the horrors <\s>
<s> i can imagine it <\s>
<s> but no girl gets outed as you call it unless she's predisposed that way <\s>
<s> that's all you know of the pressure of life <\s>
<s> i worked three years among factory girls and i know how they manage to resist things when they've got stuff in them <\s>
<s> yes i know what you mean by stuff good hard self preservative instinct <\s>
<s> why should the wretched girl who hasn't got that be turned down <\s>
<s> she wants protection all the more <\s>
<s> i've offered to help with money till she gets a place <\s>
<s> and you know she won't take it <\s>
<s> she's got that much stuff in her <\s>
<s> this place is her only chance <\s>
<s> i appeal to you mother please tell her not to go <\s>
<s> i shall not johnny <\s>
<s> turning abruptly then we know where we are <\s>
<s> i know where you'll be before a week's over <\s>
<s> from the door grimly if i am i'll have the right to be <\s>
<s> but he is gone mrs march follows to call him back but is met by mary <\s>
<s> so you've tumbled mother <\s>
<s> i should think i have <\s>
<s> johnny is making an idiot of himself about that girl <\s>
<s> he's got the best intentions <\s>
<s> it's all your father <\s>
<s> what can one expect when your father carries on like a lunatic over his paper every morning <\s>
<s> father must have opinions of his own <\s>
<s> he has only one whatever is is wrong <\s>
<s> he can't help being intellectual mother <\s>
<s> if he would only learn that the value of a sentiment is the amount of sacrifice you are prepared to make for it <\s>
<s> yes i read that in the times yesterday <\s>
<s> father's much safer than johnny <\s>
<s> johnny isn't safe at all he might make a sacrifice any day <\s>
<s> what were they doing <\s>
<s> cook caught them kissing <\s>
<s> as she speaks mr march comes in <\s>
<s> i met johnny using the most poetic language <\s>
<s> he and that girl <\s>
<s> johnny's talking nonsense about wanting to save her <\s>
<s> i've told her to pack up <\s>
<s> isn't that rather coercive joan <\s>
<s> do you approve of johnny getting entangled with this girl <\s>
<s> i was only saying to mary mrs march <\s>
<s> but i can quite see why johnny mrs march <\s>
<s> the government i suppose <\s>
<s> well perhaps you'll get us out of the mess you've got us into <\s>
<s> we must devise means mrs march smiles <\s>
<s> the first thing is to see into them and find out exactly mrs march <\s>
<s> are you going to have them x rayed <\s>
<s> they haven't got chest trouble geof <\s>
<s> they may have heart trouble <\s>
<s> it's no good being hasty joan <\s>
<s> for a man that can't see an inch into human nature give me a psychological novelist <\s>
<s> with dignity mary go and see where johnny is <\s>
<s> do you want him here <\s>
<s> dubiously well if i can <\s>
<s> a silence during which the marches look at each other by those turns which characterise exasperated domesticity <\s>
<s> if she doesn't go johnny must <\s>
<s> are you going to turn him out <\s>
<s> we must reason with him <\s>
<s> reason with young people whose lips were glued together half an hour ago <\s>
<s> why ever did you force me to take this girl <\s>
<s> ruefully one can't always resist a kindly impulse joan <\s>
<s> what does mr bly say to it <\s>
<s> follow your instincts and then complains of his daughter for following them <\s>
<s> the man's a philosopher <\s>
<s> before we know where we are we shall be having johnny married to that girl <\s>
<s> whenever you're faced with reality you say nonsense <\s>
<s> you know johnny's got chivalry on the brain <\s>
<s> he's at the top of the servants staircase outside her room <\s>
<s> he's sitting in an armchair with its back to her door <\s>
<s> he's got his pipe a pound of chocolate three volumes of monte cristo and his old concertina <\s>
<s> he says it's better than the trenches <\s>
<s> johnny's made a joke <\s>
<s> nobody can get up and she can't get down <\s>
<s> he says he'll stay there till all's blue and it's no use either of you coming unless mother caves in <\s>
<s> i wonder if cook could do anything with him <\s>
<s> he told her to go to hell <\s>
<s> and what did cook <\s>
<s> this is very awkward <\s>
<s> cook enters through the door which mary has left open <\s>
<s> what's to be done <\s>
<s> with a laugh we must devise means <\s>
<s> oh ma'am it does remind me so of the tantrums he used to get into dear little feller <\s>
<s> sharply you're not to take him up anything to eat cook <\s>
<s> but master johnny does get so hungry <\s>
<s> it'll drive him wild ma'am <\s>
<s> just a snack now and then <\s>
<s> aren't i to feed faith ma'am <\s>
<s> johnny must come down to earth <\s>
<s> i remember how he used to fall down when he was little he would go about with his head in the air <\s>
<s> but he always picked himself up like a little man <\s>
<s> the distant sounds of a concertina being played with fury drift in through the open door <\s>
<s> don't it sound eavenly <\s>
<s> the concertina utters a long wail <\s>
<s> act iii the march's dining room on the same evening at the end of a perfunctory dinner <\s>
<s> mrs march sits at the dining table with her back to the windows mary opposite the hearth and mr march with his back to it <\s>
<s> johnny is not present <\s>
<s> we always seem to be eating <\s>
<s> pouring himself out a liqueur glass of brandy but not drinking it it's humiliating to think we can't exist without <\s>
<s> relapses into gloom mrs march <\s>
<s> mary pass him the walnuts <\s>
<s> i was thinking of taking them up to johnny <\s>
<s> looking at his watch he's been there six hours even he can't live on faith <\s>
<s> if johnny wants to make a martyr of himself i can't help it <\s>
<s> how many days are you going to let him sit up there mother <\s>
<s> glancing at mrs march i never in my life knew anything so ridiculous <\s>
<s> give me a little glass of brandy geof <\s>
<s> that's the first step towards seeing reason <\s>
<s> he pours brandy into a liqueur glass from the decanter which stands between them <\s>
<s> mrs march puts the brandy to her lips and makes a little face then swallows it down manfully <\s>
<s> mary gets up with the walnuts and goes <\s>
<s> haven't you begun to see that your policy's hopeless joan <\s>
<s> tell the girl she can stay <\s>
<s> if we make johnny feel victorious we can deal with him <\s>
<s> it's just personal pride the curse of this world <\s>
<s> both you and johnny are as stubborn as mules <\s>
<s> human nature is stubborn geof <\s>
<s> that's what you easy going people never see <\s>
<s> mr march gets up vexed and goes to the fireplace <\s>
<s> this goes further than you think <\s>
<s> it involves johnny's affection and respect for you <\s>
<s> mrs march nervously refills the little brandy glass and again empties it with a grimacing shudder <\s>
<s> you'll begin to see things presently <\s>
<s> he's been digging himself in <\s>
<s> he's put a screen across the head of the stairs and got cook's blankets <\s>
<s> he's going to sleep there <\s>
<s> did he take the walnuts <\s>
<s> no he passed them in to her <\s>
<s> he says he's on hunger strike <\s>
<s> but he's eaten all the chocolate and smoked himself sick <\s>
<s> he's having the time of his life mother <\s>
<s> wait till this time to morrow <\s>
<s> cook's been up again <\s>
<s> he wouldn't let her pass <\s>
<s> she'll have to sleep in the spare room <\s>
<s> and he's got the books out of her room <\s>
<s> d'you know what they are <\s>
<s> the scarlet pimpernel the wide wide world and the bible <\s>
<s> she crosses to the fire <\s>
<s> in a low voice are you going to leave him up there with the girl and that inflammatory literature all night <\s>
<s> where's your common sense joan <\s>
<s> mrs march starts up presses her hand over her brow and sits down again <\s>
<s> with consideration for her defeat have another tot <\s>
<s> he pours it out let mary go up with a flag of truce and ask them both to come down for a thorough discussion of the whole thing on condition that they can go up again if we don't come to terms <\s>
<s> i'm quite willing to meet him <\s>
<s> i hate quarrelling with johnny <\s>
<s> he goes out mary <\s>
<s> mother this isn't a coal strike don't discuss it for three hours and then at the end ask johnny and the girl to do precisely what you're asking them to do now <\s>
<s> because it's so usual <\s>
<s> do fix on half way at once <\s>
<s> there is no half way <\s>
<s> well for goodness sake think of a plan which will make you both look victorious <\s>
<s> that's always done in the end <\s>
<s> why not let her stay and make johnny promise only to see her in the presence of a third party <\s>
<s> because she'd see him every day while he was looking for the third party <\s>
<s> she'd help him look for it <\s>
<s> with a gurgle mother i'd no idea you were so french <\s>
<s> it seems to me you none of you have any idea what i am <\s>
<s> well do remember that there'll be no publicity to make either of you look small <\s>
<s> you can have peace with honour whatever you decide <\s>
<s> listening there they are <\s>
<s> now mother don't be logical <\s>
<s> as the door opens mrs march nervously fortifies herself with the third little glass of brandy <\s>
<s> mary is on her right <\s>
<s> mr march leads into the room and stands next his daughter then faith in hat and coat to the left of the table and johnny pale but determined last <\s>
<s> assembled thus in a half fan of which mrs march is the apex so to speak they are all extremely embarrassed and no wonder <\s>
<s> suddenly mary gives a little gurgle <\s>
<s> you'd think it funnier if you'd just come out of prison and were going to be chucked out of your job on to the world again <\s>
<s> i didn't want to come down here <\s>
<s> if i'm to go i want to go at once <\s>
<s> and if i'm not it's my evening out please <\s>
<s> she moves towards the door <\s>
<s> johnny takes her by the shoulders <\s>
<s> stand still and leave it to me <\s>
<s> faith looks up at him hypnotized by his determination now mother i've come down at your request to discuss this are you ready to keep her <\s>
<s> otherwise up we go again <\s>
<s> that's not the way to go to work johnny <\s>
<s> you mustn't ask people to eat their words raw like that <\s>
<s> well i've had no dinner but i'm not going to eat my words i tell you plainly <\s>
<s> very well then go up again <\s>
<s> you two haven't the faintest idea of how to conduct a parley <\s>
<s> we have to er explore every path to find a way to peace <\s>
<s> to faith have you thought of anything to do if you leave here <\s>
<s> of course she'll just chuck herself away <\s>
<s> i'll go to a place i know of where they don't want references <\s>
<s> to faith i want to ask you a question <\s>
<s> since you came out is this the first young man who's kissed you <\s>
<s> faith has hardly had time to start and manifest what may or may not be indignation when mr march dashes his hands through his hair <\s>
<s> grimly don't condescend to answer <\s>
<s> i thought we'd met to get at the truth <\s>
<s> but do they ever <\s>
<s> i will go out <\s>
<s> and as his back is against the door she can't i'll see that you're not insulted any more <\s>
<s> johnny i know you have the best intentions but really the proper people to help the young are the old like faith suddenly turns her eyes on him and he goes on rather hurriedly your mother <\s>
<s> i'm sure that she and i will be ready to stand by faith <\s>
<s> i don't want charity <\s>
<s> but i hope mrs march <\s>
<s> roused of course if nobody will modify their attitude johnny you ought to be ashamed of yourself and to mrs march so ought you joan <\s>
<s> suddenly i'll modify mine <\s>
<s> to faith come here close <\s>
<s> in a low voice to faith will you give me your word to stay here if i make them keep you <\s>
<s> to stay here quietly for the next two years <\s>
<s> i can make them if you'll promise <\s>
<s> you're just in a temper <\s>
<s> during this colloquy the marches have been so profoundly uneasy that mrs march has poured out another glass of brandy <\s>
<s> johnny the terms of the armistice didn't include this sort of thing <\s>
<s> it was to be all open and above board <\s>
<s> well if you don't keep her i shall clear out <\s>
<s> at this bombshell mrs march rises <\s>

<s> did your two cooks tell you i'm here <\s>
<s> if you want your daughter you can take her <\s>

<s> he waves cook aside and grasps at a void alongside faith come along <\s>

<s> making no attempt to acquire the real faith to an apparition which he leads with his right hand you're the one that died when my girl was ung <\s>
<s> will you go first or shall i <\s>
<s> the apparition does not answer <\s>
<s> then you'll see what you never saw before <\s>
<s> he goes out with his apparition shepherded by mr march <\s>
<s> mrs march drinks off her fourth glass of brandy <\s>
<s> a peculiar whistle is heard through the open door and faith starts forward <\s>
<s> there's a friend waiting for me <\s>
<s> you're not fit to go out to night <\s>
<s> you're not the girl's friendly society <\s>
<s> you none of you care a pin's head what becomes of her <\s>
<s> can't you see she's on the edge <\s>
<s> the whistle is heard again but fainter <\s>
<s> i'm not in prison now <\s>
<s> taking her by the arm all right <\s>
<s> i'll come with you <\s>
<s> voices are heard in the hall <\s>
<s> who's that with father <\s>
<s> johnny for goodness sake don't make us all ridiculous <\s>
<s> mr march's voice is heard saying your friend in here <\s>
<s> he enters followed by a reluctant young man in a dark suit with dark hair and a pale square face enlivened by strange very living dark bull's eyes <\s>
<s> to faith who stands shrinking a little i came on this er friend of yours outside he's been waiting for you some time he says <\s>
<s> to faith you can go now <\s>
<s> suddenly to the young man who are you <\s>
<s> to faith are you ready <\s>
<s> seeing red no she's not and you'll just clear out <\s>
<s> what have you got to do with her <\s>
<s> i'll quit with her and not before <\s>
<s> are you his girl <\s>
<s> mrs march sits down again and reaching out her left hand mechanically draws to her the glass of brandy which her husband had poured out for himself and left undrunk <\s>
<s> then why did you he is going to say kiss me but checks himself let me think you hadn't any friends <\s>
<s> who is this fellow <\s>
<s> a little more civility please <\s>
<s> you look a blackguard and i believe you are <\s>
<s> with perfunctory authority i really can't have this sort of thing in my house <\s>
<s> johnny go upstairs and you two please go away <\s>
<s> to johnny we know the sort of chap you are takin advantage of workin girls <\s>
<s> that's a foul lie <\s>
<s> come into the garden and i'll prove it on your carcase <\s>
<s> no he'll hurt you <\s>
<s> he's been in the war <\s>
<s> to the young man you haven't i'll bet <\s>
<s> i didn't come here to be slanged <\s>
<s> this poor girl is going to have a fair deal and you're not going to give it her <\s>
<s> i can see that with half an eye <\s>
<s> you'll see it with no eyes when i've done with you <\s>
<s> he goes up to the windows <\s>
<s> for god's sake johnny stop this vulgar brawl <\s>
<s> suddenly i'm not a poor girl and i won't be called one <\s>
<s> i don't want any soft words <\s>
<s> why can't you let me be <\s>
<s> pointing to johnny he talks wild <\s>
<s> johnny clutches the edge of the writing table thinks he can rescue me <\s>
<s> i don't want to be rescued <\s>
<s> i all the feeling of years rises to the surface now that the barrier has broken i want to be let alone <\s>
<s> i've paid for everything i've done a pound for every shilling's worth <\s>
<s> and all because of one minute when i was half crazy <\s>
<s> flashing round at mary wait till you've had a baby you oughtn't to have had and not a penny in your pocket <\s>
<s> i'll have what i like now not what you think's good for me <\s>
<s> god knows we don't want to faith <\s>
<s> you mean very well mr march but you're no good <\s>
<s> you were very kind to me <\s>
<s> but you don't see nobody sees <\s>
<s> you come away with me <\s>
<s> faith's look at him is like the look of a dog at her master <\s>
<s> from the background i know you're a blackguard i've seen your sort <\s>
<s> firing up don't call him names <\s>
<s> i won't have it <\s>
<s> i'll go with whom i choose <\s>
<s> her eyes suddenly fix themselves on the young man's face and i'm going with him <\s>
<s> a mr barnabas in the hall sir <\s>
<s> mrs march drinks off her fifth little glass of brandy then sits again <\s>
<s> he goes out followed by cook <\s>
<s> well i can't wait any longer <\s>
<s> i suppose we can go out the back way <\s>
<s> he draws faith towards the windows <\s>
<s> but johnny stands there barring the way <\s>
<s> let me go let him go <\s>
<s> he takes her arm to pull her to the window he can't <\s>
<s> not if he doesn't <\s>
<s> johnny has an evident moment of hesitation and before it is over mr march comes in again followed by a man in a neat suit of plain clothes <\s>
<s> i should like you to say that in front of her <\s>
<s> afraid i'm intruding here <\s>
<s> fact is i've been waiting for a chance to speak to this young woman quietly <\s>
<s> it's rather public here sir but if you wish of course i'll mention it <\s>
<s> he waits for some word from some one no one speaks so he goes on almost apologetically well now you're in a good place here and you ought to keep it <\s>
<s> you don't want fresh trouble i'm sure <\s>
<s> scared what do you want with me <\s>
<s> i don't want to frighten you but we've had word passed that you're associating with the young man there <\s>
<s> i observed him to night again waiting outside here and whistling <\s>
<s> what's the matter with whistling <\s>
<s> eyeing him i should keep quiet if i was you <\s>
<s> as you know sir to mr march there's a law nowadays against soo tenors <\s>
<s> deprecating i don't want to use any plain english with ladies present young m <\s>
<s> i don't know you <\s>
<s> what are you after <\s>
<s> we cut the darin tisn't necessary <\s>
<s> we know all about you <\s>
<s> there miss don't let your feelings faith <\s>
<s> to the young man it's a lie isn't it <\s>
<s> to barnabas have you actual proof <\s>
<s> it's his job to get chaps into a mess <\s>
<s> sharply none of your lip now <\s>
<s> at the new tone in his voice faith turns and visibly quails like a dog that has been shown a whip <\s>
<s> how would you like to be insulted in front of your girl <\s>
<s> if you're a gentleman you'll tell him to leave the house <\s>
<s> if he's got a warrant let him produce it if he hasn't let him get out <\s>
<s> to mr march you'll understand sir that my object in speakin to you to night was for the good of the girl <\s>
<s> strictly i've gone a bit out of my way <\s>
<s> if my job was to get men into trouble as he says i'd only to wait till he's got hold of her <\s>
<s> these fellows you know are as cunning as lynxes and as impudent as the devil <\s>
<s> now look here if i get any more of this from you i i'll consult a lawyer <\s>
<s> fellows like you mr march <\s>
<s> yes and wants to be where i am <\s>
<s> but my girl knows better don't you <\s>
<s> he gives faith a look which has a certain magnetism <\s>
<s> if we could have the court cleared of ladies sir we might speak a little plainer <\s>
<s> but mrs march does not vary her smiling immobility faith draws a little nearer to the young man <\s>
<s> mary turns to the fire <\s>
<s> with half a smile i keep on forgettin that women are men nowadays <\s>
<s> when you've quite done joking we'll go for our walk <\s>
<s> to barnabas i think you'd better tell her anything you know <\s>
<s> eyeing faith and the young man i'd rather not be more precise sir at this stage <\s>
<s> i should think not <\s>
<s> to faith you know what the law is once they get a down on you <\s>
<s> to mr march it's our business to keep an eye on all this sort of thing sir with girls who've just come out <\s>
<s> deeply you've only to look at his face <\s>
<s> my face is as good as yours <\s>
<s> faith lifts her eyes to his <\s>
<s> taking in that look well there it is <\s>
<s> sorry i wasted my time and yours sir <\s>
<s> this is the turning point <\s>
<s> i've told you we'll stand by you <\s>
<s> flashing round leave me alone <\s>
<s> i stick to my friends <\s>
<s> leave me alone and leave him alone <\s>
<s> what is it to you <\s>
<s> with sudden resolution now look here <\s>
<s> this man george blunter was had up three years ago for livin on the earnings of a woman called johnson <\s>
<s> he was dismissed with a caution <\s>
<s> we got him again last year over a woman called lee that time he did young m <\s>
<s> that's enough of your lip <\s>
<s> i won't put up with this not for any woman in the world <\s>
<s> with a sway towards him it's not <\s>
<s> bong swore la companee <\s>
<s> he tarns on his heel and walks out unhindered <\s>
<s> deeply a bad hat that if ever there was one <\s>
<s> we'll be having him again before long <\s>
<s> he looks at faith <\s>
<s> they all look at faith <\s>
<s> but her face is so strange so tremulous that they all turn their eyes away <\s>
<s> on the verge of an emotional outbreak she saves herself by an effort <\s>
<s> he turns to the door touching his forehead to mr march and goes <\s>
<s> as the door closes faith sinks into a chair and burying her face in her hands sobs silently <\s>
<s> mrs march sits motionless with a faint smile <\s>
<s> johnny stands at the window biting his nails <\s>
<s> mary crosses to faith <\s>
<s> you weren't really fond of him <\s>
<s> faith bends her head <\s>
<s> but how could you <\s>
<s> i i couldn't see inside him <\s>
<s> yes but he looked couldn't you see he looked <\s>
<s> suddenly flinging up her head if you'd been two years without a word you'd believe anyone that said he liked you <\s>
<s> but i don't want him he's a liar <\s>
<s> i don't like liars <\s>
<s> looking at her yes you keep off feeling then you'll be happy <\s>
<s> where are you going <\s>
<s> with him in that state <\s>
<s> he won't hurt me <\s>
<s> mother she can stay can't she <\s>
<s> father'll come over for my things tomorrow <\s>
<s> what are you going to do <\s>
<s> proudly i'll get on <\s>
<s> from the window stop <\s>
<s> all turn and look at him <\s>
<s> will you come to me <\s>
<s> faith stares at him <\s>
<s> mrs march continues to smile faintly <\s>
<s> with a horrified gesture johnny <\s>
<s> i'll play cricket if you do <\s>
<s> under his breath good god <\s>
<s> he stares in suspense at faith whose face is a curious blend of fascination and live feeling <\s>
<s> softly don't be silly <\s>
<s> i've got no call on you <\s>
<s> you don't care for me and i don't for you <\s>
<s> you go and put your head in ice <\s>
<s> she turns to the door good bye mr march <\s>
<s> i'm sorry i've been so much trouble <\s>
<s> not at all not at all <\s>
<s> there's nothing to be done with a girl like me <\s>
<s> taking up the decanter to pour himself out a glass of brandy empty <\s>
<s> who has entered with a tray yes my dearie i'm sure you are <\s>
<s> staring at his father a vision dad <\s>
<s> windows of clubs men sitting there and that girl going by with rouge on her cheeks cook <\s>
<s> a blue night the moon over the park <\s>
<s> and she stops and looks at it what has she wanted the beautiful something better than she's got something that she'll never get <\s>
<s> she goes up to johnny and touches his forehead <\s>
<s> he comes to himself and hurries to the door but suddenly mrs march utters a little feathery laugh <\s>
<s> she stands up swaying slightly <\s>
<s> there is something unusual and charming in her appearance as if formality had dropped from her <\s>
<s> with a sort of delicate slow lack of perfect sobriety i see it all <\s>
<s> johnny stops and looks round at her <\s>
<s> moving a little towards her joan <\s>
<s> it's the way of the world <\s>
<s> you thought she wanted to be saved <\s>
<s> joan what's happened to you <\s>
<s> smiling and nodding see people as they are <\s>
<s> then you won't be disappointed <\s>
<s> your mother's not well <\s>
<s> passing her hand over her forehead it's hot in here <\s>
<s> mary throws open the french windows <\s>
<s> delightfully the room's full of gas <\s>
<s> and let's walk out into the air <\s>
<s> she turns and walks delicately out through the opened windows johnny and mary follow her <\s>
<s> the moonlight and the air flood in <\s>
<s> coming to the table and taking up the empty decanter my holy ma <\s>
<s> is this the millennium cook <\s>
<s> master geoffrey there isn't a millehennium <\s>
<s> there's too much human nature <\s>
<s> we must look things in the face <\s>
<s> neither up nor down but straight in the face <\s>
<s> quite a thought cook <\s>
