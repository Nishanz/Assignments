<s> the history of pendennis by william makepeace thackeray to dr <\s>
<s> john elliotson my dear doctor thirteen months ago when it seemed likely that this story had come to a close a kind friend brought you to my bedside whence in all probability i never should have risen but for your constant watchfulness and skill <\s>
<s> i like to recall your great goodness and kindness as well as many acts of others showing quite a surprising friendship and sympathy at that time when kindness and friendship were most needed and welcome <\s>
<s> and as you would take no other fee but thanks let me record them here in behalf of me and mine and subscribe myself yours most sincerely and gratefully w <\s>
<s> preface if this kind of composition of which the two years product is now laid before the public fail in art as it constantly does and must it at least has the advantage of a certain truth and honesty which a work more elaborate might lose <\s>
<s> in his constant communication with the reader the writer is forced into frankness of expression and to speak out his own mind and feelings as they urge him <\s>
<s> many a slip of the pen and the printer many a word spoken in haste he sees and would recall as he looks over his volume <\s>
<s> it is a sort of confidential talk between writer and reader which must often be dull must often flag <\s>
<s> in the course of his volubility the perpetual speaker must of necessity lay bare his own weaknesses vanities peculiarities <\s>
<s> and as we judge of a man's character after long frequenting his society not by one speech or by one mood or opinion or by one day's talk but by the tenor of his general bearing and conversation so of a writer who delivers himself up to you perforce unreservedly you say is he honest <\s>
<s> does he tell the truth in the main <\s>
<s> does he seem actuated by a desire to find out and speak it <\s>
<s> is he a quack who shams sentiment or mouths for effect <\s>
<s> does he seek popularity by claptraps or other arts <\s>
<s> i can no more ignore good fortune than any other chance which has befallen me <\s>
<s> i have found many thousands more readers than i ever looked for <\s>
<s> i have no right to say to these you shall not find fault with my art or fall asleep over my pages but i ask you to believe that this person writing strives to tell the truth <\s>
<s> if there is not that there is nothing <\s>
<s> perhaps the lovers of excitement may care to know that this book began with a very precise plan which was entirely put aside <\s>
<s> ladies and gentlemen you were to have been treated and the writer's and the publisher's pocket benefited by the recital of the most active horrors <\s>
<s> what more exciting than a ruffian with many admirable virtues in st <\s>
<s> giles's visited constantly by a young lady from belgravia <\s>
<s> what more stirring than the contrasts of society <\s>
<s> the mixture of slang and fashionable language <\s>
<s> the escapes the battles the murders <\s>
<s> nay up to nine o'clock this very morning my poor friend colonel altamont was doomed to execution and the author only relented when his victim was actually at the window <\s>
<s> the exciting plan was laid aside with a very honourable forbearance on the part of the publishers because on attempting it i found that i failed from want of experience of my subject and never having been intimate with any convict in my life and the manners of ruffians and gaol birds being quite unfamiliar to me the idea of entering into competition with m <\s>
<s> eugene sue was abandoned <\s>
<s> to describe a real rascal you must make him so horrible that he would be too hideous to show and unless the painter paints him fairly i hold he has no right to show him at all <\s>
<s> even the gentlemen of our age this is an attempt to describe one of them no better nor worse than most educated men even these we cannot show as they are with the notorious foibles and selfishness of their lives and their education <\s>
<s> since the author of tom jones was buried no writer of fiction among us has been permitted to depict to his utmost power a man <\s>
<s> we must drape him and give him a certain conventional simper <\s>
<s> society will not tolerate the natural in our art <\s>
<s> many ladies have remonstrated and subscribers left me because in the course of the story i described a young man resisting and affected by temptation <\s>
<s> my object was to say that he had the passions to feel and the manliness and generosity to overcome them <\s>
<s> you will not hear it is best to know it what moves in the real world what passes in society in the clubs colleges mess rooms what is the life and talk of your sons <\s>
<s> a little more frankness than is customary has been attempted in this story with no bad desire on the writer's part it is hoped and with no ill consequence to any reader <\s>
<s> if truth is not always pleasant at any rate truth is best from whatever chair from those whence graver writers or thinkers argue as from that at which the story teller sits as he concludes his labour and bids his kind reader farewell <\s>

<s> shows how first love may interrupt breakfast one fine morning in the full london season major arthur pendennis came over from his lodgings according to his custom to breakfast at a certain club in pall mall of which he was a chief ornament <\s>
<s> as he was one of the finest judges of wine in england and a man of active dominating and inquiring spirit he had been very properly chosen to be a member of the committee of this club and indeed was almost the manager of the institution and the stewards and waiters bowed before him as reverentially as to a duke or a field marshal <\s>
<s> at a quarter past ten the major invariably made his appearance in the best blacked boots in all london with a checked morning cravat that never was rumpled until dinner time a buff waistcoat which bore the crown of his sovereign on the buttons and linen so spotless that mr <\s>
<s> brummel himself asked the name of his laundress and would probably have employed her had not misfortunes compelled that great man to fly the country <\s>
<s> pendennis's coat his white gloves his whiskers his very cane were perfect of their kind as specimens of the costume of a military man en retraite <\s>
<s> at a distance or seeing his back merely you would have taken him to be not more than thirty years old it was only by a nearer inspection that you saw the factitious nature of his rich brown hair and that there were a few crow's feet round about the somewhat faded eyes of his handsome mottled face <\s>
<s> his nose was of the wellington pattern <\s>
<s> his hands and wristbands were beautifully long and white <\s>
<s> on the latter he wore handsome gold buttons given to him by his royal highness the duke of york and on the others more than one elegant ring the chief and largest of them being emblazoned with the famous arms of pendennis <\s>
<s> he always took possession of the same table in the same corner of the room from which nobody ever now thought of ousting him <\s>
<s> one or two mad wags and wild fellows had in former days and in freak or bravado endeavoured twice or thrice to deprive him of this place but there was a quiet dignity in the major's manner as he took his seat at the next table and surveyed the interlopers which rendered it impossible for any man to sit and breakfast under his eye and that table by the fire and yet near the window became his own <\s>
<s> his letters were laid out there in expectation of his arrival and many was the young fellow about town who looked with wonder at the number of those notes and at the seals and franks which they bore <\s>
<s> if there was any question about etiquette society who was married to whom of what age such and such a duke was pendennis was the man to whom every one appealed <\s>
<s> marchionesses used to drive up to the club and leave notes for him or fetch him out <\s>
<s> he was perfectly affable <\s>
<s> the young men liked to walk with him in the park or down pall mall for he touched his hat to everybody and every other man he met was a lord <\s>
<s> the major sate down at his accustomed table then and while the waiters went to bring him his toast and his hot newspaper he surveyed his letters through his gold double eye glass <\s>
<s> he carried it so gaily you would hardly have known it was spectacles in disguise and examined one pretty note after another and laid them by in order <\s>
<s> there were large solemn dinner cards suggestive of three courses and heavy conversation there were neat little confidential notes conveying female entreaties there was a note on thick official paper from the marquis of steyne telling him to come to richmond to a little party at the star and garter and speak french which language the major possessed very perfectly and another from the bishop of ealing and mrs <\s>
<s> trail requesting the honour of major pendennis's company at ealing house all of which letters pendennis read gracefully and with the more satisfaction because glowry the scotch surgeon breakfasting opposite to him was looking on and hating him for having so many invitations which nobody ever sent to glowry <\s>
<s> these perused the major took out his pocket book to see on what days he was disengaged and which of these many hospitable calls he could afford to accept or decline <\s>
<s> he threw over cutler the east india director in baker street in order to dine with lord steyne and the little french party at the star and garter the bishop he accepted because though the dinner was slow he liked to dine with bishops and so went through his list and disposed of them according to his fancy or interest <\s>
<s> then he took his breakfast and looked over the paper the gazette the births and deaths and the fashionable intelligence to see that his name was down among the guests at my lord so and so's fete and in the intervals of these occupations carried on cheerful conversation with his acquaintances about the room <\s>
<s> among the letters which formed major pendennis's budget for that morning there was only one unread and which lay solitary and apart from all the fashionable london letters with a country postmark and a homely seal <\s>
<s> the superscription was in a pretty delicate female hand and though marked immediate by the fair writer with a strong dash of anxiety under the word yet the major had for reasons of his own neglected up to the present moment his humble rural petitioner who to be sure could hardly hope to get a hearing among so many grand folks who attended his levee <\s>
<s> the fact was this was a letter from a female relative of pendennis and while the grandees of her brother's acquaintance were received and got their interview and drove off as it were the patient country letter remained for a long time waiting for an audience in the ante chamber under the slop bason <\s>
<s> at last it came to be this letter's turn and the major broke a seal with fairoaks engraved upon it and clavering st <\s>
<s> mary's for a postmark <\s>
<s> it was a double letter and the major commenced perusing the envelope before he attacked the inner epistle <\s>
<s> is it a letter from another jook growled mr <\s>
<s> glowry inwardly pendennis would not be leaving that to the last i'm thinking <\s>
<s> my dear major pendennis the letter ran i beg and implore you to come to me immediately very likely thought pendennis and steyne's dinner to day i am in the very greatest grief and perplexity <\s>
<s> my dearest boy who has been hitherto everything the fondest mother could wish is grieving me dreadfully <\s>
<s> he has formed i can hardly write it a passion an infatuation the major grinned for an actress who has been performing here <\s>
<s> she is at least twelve years older than arthur who will not be eighteen till next february and the wretched boy insists upon marrying her <\s>
<s> what's making pendennis swear now mr <\s>
<s> glowry asked of himself for rage and wonder were concentrated in the major's open mouth as he read this astounding announcement <\s>
<s> do my dear friend the grief stricken lady went on come to me instantly on the receipt of this and as arthur's guardian entreat command the wretched child to give up this most deplorable resolution <\s>
<s> and after more entreaties to the above effect the writer concluded by signing herself the major's unhappy affectionate sister helen pendennis <\s>
<s> fairoaks tuesday the major concluded reading the last words of the letter a d  d pretty business at fairoaks tuesday now let us see what the boy has to say and he took the other letter which was written in a great floundering boy's hand and sealed with the large signet of the pendennises even larger than the major's own and with supplementary wax sputtered all round the seal in token of the writer's tremulousness and agitation <\s>
<s> the epistle ran thus fairoaks monday midnight <\s>
<s> my dear uncle in informing you of my engagement with miss costigan daughter of j <\s>
<s> chesterfield costigan esq of costiganstown but perhaps better known to you under her professional name of miss fotheringay of the theatres royal drury lane and crow street and of the norwich and welsh circuit i am aware that i make an announcement which cannot according to the present prejudices of society at least be welcome to my family <\s>
<s> my dearest mother on whom god knows i would wish to inflict no needless pain is deeply moved and grieved i am sorry to say by the intelligence which i have this night conveyed to her <\s>
<s> i beseech you my dear sir to come down and reason with her and console her <\s>
<s> although obliged by poverty to earn an honourable maintenance by the exercise of her splendid talents miss costigan's family is as ancient and noble as our own <\s>
<s> when our ancestor ralph pendennis landed with richard ii <\s>
<s> in ireland my emily's forefathers were kings of that country <\s>
<s> i have the information from mr <\s>
<s> costigan who like yourself is a military man <\s>
<s> it is in vain i have attempted to argue with my dear mother and prove to her that a young lady of irreproachable character and lineage endowed with the most splendid gifts of beauty and genius who devotes herself to the exercise of one of the noblest professions for the sacred purpose of maintaining her family is a being whom we should all love and reverence rather than avoid my poor mother has prejudices which it is impossible for my logic to overcome and refuses to welcome to her arms one who is disposed to be her most affectionate daughter through life <\s>
<s> although miss costigan is some years older than myself that circumstance does not operate as a barrier to my affection and i am sure will not influence its duration <\s>
<s> a love like mine sir i feel is contracted once and for ever <\s>
<s> as i never had dreamed of love until i saw her i feel now that i shall die without ever knowing another passion <\s>
<s> it is the fate of my life <\s>
<s> it was miss c s own delicacy which suggested that the difference of age which i never felt might operate as a bar to our union <\s>
<s> but having loved once i should despise myself and be unworthy of my name as a gentleman if i hesitated to abide by my passion if i did not give all where i felt all and endow the woman who loves me fondly with my whole heart and my whole fortune <\s>
<s> i press for a speedy marriage with my emily for why in truth should it be delayed <\s>
<s> a delay implies a doubt which i cast from me as unworthy <\s>
<s> it is impossible that my sentiments can change towards emily that at any age she can be anything but the sole object of my love <\s>
<s> i entreat you my dear uncle to come down and reconcile my dear mother to our union and i address you as a man of the world qui mores hominum multorum vidit et urbes who will not feel any of the weak scruples and fears which agitate a lady who has scarcely ever left her village <\s>
<s> pray come down to us immediately <\s>
<s> i am quite confident that apart from considerations of fortune you will admire and approve of my emily your affectionate nephew arthur pendennis jr <\s>
<s> when the major had concluded the perusal of this letter his countenance assumed an expression of such rage and horror that glowry the surgeon official felt in his pocket for his lancet which he always carried in his card case and thought his respected friend was going into a fit <\s>
<s> the intelligence was indeed sufficient to agitate pendennis <\s>
<s> the head of the pendennises going to marry an actress ten years his senior a headstrong boy going to plunge into matrimony <\s>
<s> the mother has spoiled the young rascal groaned the major inwardly with her cursed sentimentality and romantic rubbish <\s>
<s> my nephew marry a tragedy queen <\s>
<s> gracious mercy people will laugh at me so that i shall not dare show my head <\s>
<s> and he thought with an inexpressible pang that he must give up lord steyne's dinner at richmond and must lose his rest and pass the night in an abominable tight mail coach instead of taking pleasure as he had promised himself in some of the most agreeable and select society in england <\s>
<s> and he must not only give up this but all other engagements for some time to come <\s>
<s> who knows how long the business might detain him <\s>
<s> he quitted his breakfast table for the adjoining writing room and there ruefully wrote off refusals to the marquis the earl the bishop and all his entertainers and he ordered his servant to take places in the mail coach for that evening of course charging the sum which he disbursed for the seats to the account of the widow and the young scapegrace of whom he was guardian <\s>
<s> a pedigree and other family matters early in the regency of george the magnificent there lived in a small town in the west of england called clavering a gentleman whose name was pendennis <\s>
<s> there were those alive who remembered having seen his name painted on a board which was surmounted by a gilt pestle and mortar over the door of a very humble little shop in the city of bath where mr <\s>
<s> pendennis exercised the profession of apothecary and surgeon and where he not only attended gentlemen in their sick rooms and ladies at the most interesting periods of their lives but would condescend to sell a brown paper plaster to a farmer's wife across the counter or to vend tooth brushes hair powder and london perfumery <\s>
<s> for these facts a few folks at clavering could vouch where people's memories were more tenacious perhaps than they are in a great bustling metropolis <\s>
<s> and yet that little apothecary who sold a stray customer a pennyworth of salts or a more fragrant cake of windsor soap was a gentleman of good education and of as old a family as any in the whole county of somerset <\s>
<s> he had a cornish pedigree which carried the pendennises up to the time of the druids and who knows how much farther back <\s>
<s> they had intermarried with the normans at a very late period of their family existence and they were related to all the great families of wales and brittany <\s>
<s> pendennis had had a piece of university education too and might have pursued that career with great honour but that in his second year at cambridge his father died insolvent and poor pen was obliged to betake himself to the pestle and apron <\s>
<s> he always detested the trade and it was only necessity and the offer of his mother's brother a london apothecary of low family into which pendennis's father had demeaned himself by marrying that forced john pendennis into so odious a calling <\s>
<s> he quickly after his apprenticeship parted from the coarse minded practitioner his relative and set up for himself at bath with his modest medical ensign <\s>
<s> he had for some time a hard struggle with poverty and it was all he could do to keep the shop and its gilt ornaments in decent repair and his bed ridden mother in comfort but lady ribstone happening to be passing to the rooms with an intoxicated irish chairman who bumped her ladyship up against pen's very door post and drove his chair pole through the handsomest pink bottle in the surgeon's window alighted screaming from her vehicle and was accommodated with a chair in mr <\s>
<s> pendennis's shop where she was brought round with cinnamon and sal volatile <\s>
<s> pendennis's manners were so uncommonly gentlemanlike and soothing that her ladyship the wife of sir pepin ribstone of codlingbury in the county of somerset bart appointed her preserver as she called him apothecary to her person and family which was very large <\s>
<s> master ribstone coming home for the christmas holidays from eton over ate himself and had a fever in which mr <\s>
<s> pendennis treated him with the greatest skill and tenderness <\s>
<s> in a word he got the good graces of the codlingbury family and from that day began to prosper <\s>
<s> the good company of bath patronised him and amongst the ladies especially he was beloved and admired <\s>
<s> first his humble little shop became a smart one then he discarded the selling of tooth brushes and perfumery as unworthy of a gentleman of an ancient lineage then he shut up the shop altogether and only had a little surgery attended by a genteel young man then he had a gig with a man to drive him and before her exit from this world his poor old mother had the happiness of seeing from her bedroom window to which her chair was rolled her beloved john step into a close carriage of his own a one horse carriage it is true but with the arms of the family of pendennis handsomely emblazoned on the panels <\s>
<s> what would arthur say now <\s>
<s> she asked speaking of a younger son of hers who never so much as once came to see my dearest johnny through all the time of his poverty and struggles <\s>
<s> captain pendennis is with his regiment in india mother mr <\s>
<s> pendennis remarked and if you please i wish you would not call me johnny before the young man before mr <\s>
<s> presently the day came when she ceased to call her son by the name of johnny or by any other title of endearment or affection and his house was very lonely without that kind though querulous voice <\s>
<s> he had his night bell altered and placed in the room in which the good old lady had grumbled for many a long year and he slept in the great large bed there <\s>
<s> he was upwards of forty years old when these events befell before the war was over before george the magnificent came to the throne before this history indeed but what is a gentleman without his pedigree <\s>
<s> pendennis by this time had his handsomely framed and glazed and hanging up in his drawing room between the pictures of codlingbury house in somersetshire and st <\s>
<s> boniface's college cambridge where he had passed the brief and happy days of his early manhood <\s>
<s> as for the pedigree he had taken it out of a trunk as sterne's officer called for his sword now that he was a gentleman and could show it <\s>
<s> about the time of mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis's demise another of her son's patients likewise died at bath that virtuous woman old lady pontypool daughter of reginald twelfth earl of bareacres and by consequence great grand aunt to the present earl and widow of john second lord pontypool and likewise of the reverend jonas wales of the armageddon chapel clifton <\s>
<s> for the last five years of her life her ladyship had been attended by miss helen thistlewood a very distant relative of the noble house of bareacres before mentioned and daughter of lieutenant r <\s>
<s> thistlewood r n killed at the battle of copenhagen <\s>
<s> under lady pontypool's roof miss thistlewood found a comfortable shelter as far as boarding and lodging went but suffered under such an infernal tyranny as only women can inflict on or bear from one another the doctor who paid his visits to my lady pontypool at least twice a day could not but remark the angelical sweetness and kindness with which the young lady bore her elderly relative's insults and it was as they were going in the fourth mourning coach to attend her ladyship's venerated remains to bath abbey where they now repose that he looked at her sweet pale face and resolved upon putting a certain question to her the very nature of which made his pulse beat ninety at least <\s>
<s> he was older than she by more than twenty years and at no time the most ardent of men <\s>
<s> perhaps he had had a love affair in early life which he had to strangle perhaps all early love affairs ought to be strangled or drowned like so many blind kittens well at three and forty he was a collected quiet little gentleman in black stockings with a bald head and a few days after the ceremony he called to see her and as he felt her pulse he kept hold of her hand in his and asked her where she was going to live now that the pontypool family had come down upon the property which was being nailed into boxes and packed into hampers and swaddled up with haybands and buried in straw and locked under three keys in green baize plate chests and carted away under the eyes of poor miss helen he asked her where she was going to live finally <\s>
<s> her eyes filled with tears and she said she did not know <\s>
<s> she had a little money <\s>
<s> the old lady had left her a thousand pounds indeed and she would go into a boarding house or into a school in fine she did not know where <\s>
<s> then pendennis looking into her pale face and keeping hold of her cold little hand asked her if she would come and live with him <\s>
<s> he was old compared to to so blooming a young lady as miss thistlewood pendennis was of the grave old complimentary school of gentlemen and apothecaries but he was of good birth and he flattered himself of good principles and temper <\s>
<s> his prospects were good and daily mending <\s>
<s> he was alone in the world and had need of a kind and constant companion whom it would be the study of his life to make happy in a word he recited to her a little speech which he had composed that morning in bed and rehearsed and perfected in his carriage as he was coming to wait upon the young lady <\s>
<s> perhaps if he had had an early love passage she too had one day hoped for a different lot than to be wedded to a little gentleman who rapped his teeth and smiled artificially who was laboriously polite to the butler as he slid upstairs into the drawing room and profusely civil to the lady's maid who waited at the bed room door for whom her old patroness used to ring as for a servant and who came with even more eagerness who got up stories as he sent in draughts for his patient's amusement and his own profit perhaps she would have chosen a different man but she knew on the other hand how worthy pendennis was how prudent how honourable how good he had been to his mother and constant in his care of her and the upshot of this interview was that she blushing very much made pendennis an extremely low curtsey and asked leave to to consider his very kind proposal <\s>
<s> they were married in the dull bath season which was the height of the season in london <\s>
<s> and pendennis having previously through a professional friend m r c s secured lodgings in holles street cavendish square took his wife thither in a chaise and pair conducted her to the theatres the parks and the chapel royal showed her the folks going to a drawing room and in a word gave her all the pleasures of the town <\s>
<s> he likewise left cards upon lord pontypool upon the right honourable the earl of bareacres and upon sir pepin and lady ribstone his earliest and kindest patrons <\s>
<s> bareacres took no notice of the cards <\s>
<s> pontypool called admired mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis and said lady pontypool would come and see her which her ladyship did per proxy of john her footman who brought her card and an invitation to a concert five weeks off <\s>
<s> pendennis was back in his little one horse carriage dispensing draughts and pills at that time but the ribstones asked him and mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis to an entertainment of which mr <\s>
<s> pendennis bragged to the last day of his life <\s>
<s> the secret ambition of mr <\s>
<s> pendennis had always been to be a gentleman <\s>
<s> it takes much time and careful saving for a provincial doctor whose gains are not very large to lay by enough money wherewith to purchase a house and land but besides our friend's own frugality and prudence fortune aided him considerably in his endeavour and brought him to the point which he so panted to attain <\s>
<s> he laid out some money very advantageously in the purchase of a house and small estate close upon the village of clavering before mentioned <\s>
<s> words cannot describe nor did he himself ever care to confess to any one his pride when he found himself a real landed proprietor and could walk over acres of which he was the master <\s>
<s> a lucky purchase which he had made of shares in a copper mine added very considerably to his wealth and he realised with great prudence while this mine was still at its full vogue <\s>
<s> finally he sold his business at bath to mr <\s>
<s> parkins for a handsome sum of ready money and for an annuity to be paid to him during a certain number of years after he had for ever retired from the handling of the mortar and pestle <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis his son was eight years old at the time of this event so that it is no wonder that the latter who left bath and the surgery so young should forget the existence of such a place almost entirely and that his father's hands had ever been dirtied by the compounding of odious pills or the preparation of filthy plasters <\s>
<s> the old man never spoke about the shop himself never alluded to it called in the medical practitioner of clavering to attend his family when occasion arrived sunk the black breeches and stockings altogether attended market and sessions and wore a bottle green coat and brass buttons with drab gaiters just as if he had been an english gentleman all his life <\s>
<s> he used to stand at his lodge gate and see the coaches come in and bow gravely to the guards and coachmen as they touched their hats and drove by <\s>
<s> it was he who founded the clavering book club and set up the samaritan soup and blanket society <\s>
<s> it was he who brought the mail which used to run through cacklefield before away from that village and through clavering <\s>
<s> at church he was equally active as a vestryman and a worshipper <\s>
<s> at market every thursday he went from pen to stall looked at samples of oats and munched corn felt beasts punched geese in the breast and weighed them with a knowing air and did business with the farmers at the clavering arms as well as the oldest frequenter of that house of call <\s>
<s> it was now his shame as it formerly was his pride to be called doctor and those who wished to please him always gave him the title of squire <\s>
<s> heaven knows where they came from but a whole range of pendennis portraits presently hung round the doctor's oak dining room lelys and vandykes he vowed all the portraits to be and when questioned as to the history of the originals would vaguely say they were ancestors of his <\s>
<s> you could see by his wife's looks that she disbelieved in these genealogical legends for she generally endeavoured to turn the conversation when he commenced them <\s>
<s> but his little boy believed them to their fullest extent and roger pendennis of agincourt arthur pendennis of crecy general pendennis of blenheim and oudenarde were as real and actual beings for this young gentleman as whom shall we say as robinson crusoe or peter wilkins or the seven champions of christendom whose histories were in his library <\s>
<s> pendennis's fortune which at the best was not above eight hundred pounds a year did not with the best economy and management permit of his living with the great folks of the county but he had a decent comfortable society of the second best sort <\s>
<s> if they were not the roses they lived near the roses as it were and had a good deal of the odour of genteel life <\s>
<s> they had out their plate and dined each other round in the moonlight nights twice a year coming a dozen miles to these festivals and besides the county the pendennises had the society of the town of clavering as much as nay more than they liked for mrs <\s>
<s> pybus was always poking about helen's conservatories and intercepting the operation of her soup tickets and coal clubs captain glanders h <\s>

<s> wapshot of clavering grammar school for overflogging his son anglesea glanders with all the village in fine <\s>
<s> and pendennis and his wife often blessed themselves that their house of fairoaks was nearly a mile out of clavering or their premises would never have been free from the prying eyes and prattle of one or other of the male and female inhabitants there <\s>
<s> fairoaks lawn comes down to the little river brawl and on the other side were the plantations and woods as much as were left of them of clavering park sir francis clavering bart <\s>
<s> the park was let out in pasture and fed down by sheep and cattle when the pendennises came first to live at fairoaks <\s>

<s> such walks and conversation generally ended in a profusion of filial and maternal embraces for to love and to pray were the main occupations of this dear woman's life and i have often heard pendennis say in his wild way that he felt that he was sure of going to heaven for his mother never could be happy there without him <\s>
<s> as for john pendennis as the father of the family and that sort of thing everybody had the greatest respect for him and his orders were obeyed like those of the medes and persians <\s>

<s> after dinner he always had a nap with the globe newspaper on his knee and his yellow bandanna handkerchief on his face major pendennis sent the yellow handkerchiefs from india and his brother had helped in the purchase of his majority so that they were good friends now <\s>
<s> and so as his dinner took place at six o'clock to a minute and the sunset business alluded to may be supposed to have occurred at about half past seven it is probable that he did not much care for the view in front of his lawn windows or take any share in the poetry and caresses which were taking place there <\s>

<s> my brother major pendennis was a constant theme of the retired doctor's conversation <\s>

<s> their carriages would come from ten miles round to call upon major pendennis in his visits to fairoaks the fame of his fashion as a man about town was established throughout the county <\s>
<s> there was a talk of his marrying miss hunkle of lilybank old hunkle the attorney's daughter with at least fifteen hundred a year to her fortune but my brother the major refused this negotiation advantageous as it might seem to most persons <\s>
<s> as a bachelor he said nobody cares how poor i am <\s>
<s> i have the happiness to live with people who are so highly placed in the world that a few hundreds or thousands a year more or less can make no difference in the estimation in which they are pleased to hold me <\s>

<s> the major was a great favourite with almost all the little establishment of fairoaks <\s>
<s> he was as good natured as he was well bred and had a sincere liking and regard for his sister in law whom he pronounced and with perfect truth to be as fine a lady as any in england and an honour to the family <\s>
<s> pendennis's tranquil beauty her natural sweetness and kindness and that simplicity and dignity which a perfect purity and innocence are sure to bestow upon a handsome woman rendered her quite worthy of her brother's praises <\s>

<s> arthur pendennis had the good fortune to have a mother endowed with these happy qualities <\s>

<s> she spoke about mr <\s>
<s> pendennis a worthy little gentleman enough but there are others as good as he with an awful reverence as if he had been the pope of rome on his throne and she a cardinal kneeling at his feet and giving him incense <\s>
<s> the major she held to be a sort of bayard among majors and as for her son arthur she worshipped that youth with an ardour which the young scapegrace accepted almost as coolly as the statue of the saint in saint peter's receives the rapturous osculations which the faithful deliver on his toe <\s>
<s> this unfortunate superstition and idol worship of this good woman was the cause of a great deal of the misfortune which befell the young gentleman who is the hero of this history and deserves therefore to be mentioned at the outset of his story <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis's schoolfellows at the greyfriars school state that as a boy he was in no ways remarkable either as a dunce or as a scholar <\s>
<s> he did in fact just as much as was required of him and no more <\s>
<s> if he was distinguished for anything it was for verse writing but was his enthusiasm ever so great it stopped when he had composed the number of lines demanded by the regulations unlike young swettenham for instance who with no more of poetry in his composition than mr <\s>
<s> wakley yet would bring up a hundred dreary hexameters to the master after a half holiday or young fluxmore who not only did his own verses but all the fifth form's besides <\s>
<s> he never read to improve himself out of school hours but on the contrary devoured all the novels plays and poetry on which he could lay his hands <\s>
<s> he never was flogged but it was a wonder how he escaped the whipping post <\s>
<s> when he had money he spent it royally in tarts for himself and his friends he has been known to disburse nine and sixpence out of ten shillings awarded to him in a single day <\s>
<s> when he had no funds he went on tick <\s>
<s> when he could get no credit he went without and was almost as happy <\s>
<s> he has been known to take a thrashing for a crony without saying a word but a blow ever so slight from a friend would make him roar <\s>
<s> to fighting he was averse from his earliest youth as indeed to physic the greek grammar or any other exertion and would engage in none of them except at the last extremity <\s>
<s> he seldom if ever told lies and never bullied little boys <\s>
<s> those masters or seniors who were kind to him he loved with boyish ardour <\s>
<s> and though the doctor when he did not know his horace or could not construe his greek play said that that boy pendennis was a disgrace to the school a candidate for ruin in this world and perdition in the next a profligate who would most likely bring his venerable father to ruin and his mother to a dishonoured grave and the like yet as the doctor made use of these compliments to most of the boys in the place which has not turned out an unusual number of felons and pickpockets little pen at first uneasy and terrified by these charges became gradually accustomed to hear them and he has not in fact either murdered his parents or committed any act worthy of transportation or hanging up to the present day <\s>
<s> there were many of the upper boys among the cistercians with whom pendennis was educated who assumed all the privileges of men long before they quitted that seminary <\s>
<s> many of them for example smoked cigars and some had already begun the practice of inebriation <\s>
<s> one had fought a duel with an ensign in a marching in consequence of a row at the theatre another actually kept a buggy and horse at a livery stable in covent garden and might be seen driving any sunday in hyde park with a groom with squared arms and armorial buttons by his side <\s>

<s> well pen had just made his public appearance in a coat with a tail or cauda virilis and was looking most anxiously in his little study glass to see if his whiskers were growing like those of more fortunate youths his companions and instead of the treble voice with which he used to speak and sing for his singing voice was a very sweet one and he used when little to be made to perform home sweet home my pretty page and a french song or two which his mother had taught him and other ballads for the delectation of the senior boys had suddenly plunged into a deep bass diversified by a squeak which when he was called upon to construe in school set the master and scholars laughing he was about sixteen years old in a word when he was suddenly called away from his academic studies <\s>
<s> it was at the close of the forenoon school and pen had been unnoticed all the previous part of the morning till now when the doctor put him on to construe in a greek play <\s>

<s> a boy sir who does not learn his greek play cheats the parent who spends money for his education <\s>
<s> a boy who cheats his parent is not very far from robbing or forging upon his neighbour <\s>
<s> a man who forges on his neighbour pays the penalty of his crime at the gallows <\s>
<s> and it is not such a one that i pity for he will be deservedly cut off but his maddened and heart broken parents who are driven to a premature grave by his crimes or if they live drag on a wretched and dishonoured old age <\s>
<s> go on sir and i warn you that the very next mistake that you make shall subject you to the punishment of the rod <\s>
<s> what ill conditioned boy is there that dares to laugh <\s>
<s> indeed while the master was making this oration there was a general titter behind him in the schoolroom <\s>
<s> the orator had his back to the door of this ancient apartment which was open and a gentleman who was quite familiar with the place for both major arthur and mr <\s>

<s> the intelligence was passed round that it was pendennis's uncle in an instant and a hundred young faces wondering and giggling between terror and laughter turned now to the new comer and then to the awful doctor <\s>
<s> the major asked the fifth form boy to carry his card up to the doctor which the lad did with an arch look <\s>
<s> major pendennis had written on the card i must take a <\s>
<s> home his father is very ill <\s>
<s> as the doctor received the card and stopped his harangue with rather a seared look the laughter of the boys half constrained until then burst out in a general shout <\s>

<s> it was two minutes to one <\s>
<s> we will take the juvenal at afternoon school he said nodding to the captain and all the boys understanding the signal gathered up their books and poured out of the hall <\s>
<s> young pen saw by his uncle's face that something had happened at home <\s>
<s> is there anything the matter with my mother <\s>
<s> he could hardly speak though for emotion and the tears which were ready to start <\s>
<s> no said the major but your father's very ill <\s>

<s> pen went off quickly to his boarding house to do as his uncle bade him and the doctor now left alone in the schoolroom came out to shake hands with his old schoolfellow <\s>
<s> you would not have thought it was the same man <\s>
<s> as cinderella at a particular hour became from a blazing and magnificent princess quite an ordinary little maid in a grey petticoat so as the clock struck one all the thundering majesty and awful wrath of the schoolmaster disappeared <\s>
<s> there is nothing serious i hope said the doctor <\s>
<s> it is a pity to take the boy away unless there is <\s>
<s> he is a very good boy rather idle and unenergetic but he is a very honest gentlemanlike little fellow though i can't get him to construe as i wish <\s>
<s> won't you come in and have some luncheon <\s>
<s> my wife will be very happy to see you <\s>

<s> the major answered no <\s>
<s> and there's a good eh a good eh property i believe <\s>
<s> asked the other in an off hand way <\s>
<s> h'm so so said the major <\s>
<s> whereupon this colloquy came to an end <\s>
<s> and arthur pendennis got into the postchaise with his uncle never to come back to school any more <\s>
<s> as the chaise drove through clavering the hostler standing whistling under the archway of the clavering arms winked the postilion ominously as much as to say all was over <\s>

<s> all the blinds were down at fairoaks the face of the old footman was as blank when he let them in <\s>

<s> whatever of warmth and love the deceased man might have had and he adored his wife and loved and admired his son with all his heart he had shut them up within himself nor had the boy been ever able to penetrate that frigid outward barrier <\s>
<s> but arthur had been his father's pride and glory through life and his name the last which john pendennis had tried to articulate whilst he lay with his wife's hand clasping his own cold and clammy palm as the flickering spirit went out into the darkness of death and life and the world passed away from him <\s>
<s> the little girl whose face had peered for a moment under the blinds as the chaise came up opened the door from the stairs into the hall and taking arthur's hand silently as he stooped down to kiss her led him upstairs to his mother <\s>
<s> old john opened the dining room door for the major <\s>
<s> the room was darkened with the blinds down and surrounded by all the gloomy pictures of the pendennises <\s>
<s> he drank a glass of wine <\s>
<s> the bottle had been opened for the squire four days before <\s>
<s> his hat was brushed and laid on the hall table his newspapers and his letter bag with john pendennis esquire fairoaks engraved upon the brass plate were there in waiting <\s>
<s> the doctor and the lawyer from clavering who had seen the chaise pass through came up in a gig half an hour after the major's arrival and entered by the back door <\s>

<s> pendennis enlarged on his virtues and the estimation in which the neighbourhood held him on what a loss he would be to the magistrates bench the county hospital etc <\s>
<s> pendennis bore up wonderfully he said especially since master arthur's arrival <\s>
<s> the lawyer stayed and dined with major pendennis and they talked business all the evening <\s>

<s> everything was left unreservedly to her except in case of a second marriage an occasion which might offer itself in the case of so young and handsome a woman mr <\s>
<s> tatham gallantly said when different provisions were enacted by the deceased <\s>
<s> the major would of course take entire superintendence of everything under this most impressive and melancholy occasion <\s>
<s> aware of this authority old john the footman when he brought major pendennis the candle to go to bed followed afterwards with the plate basket and the next morning brought him the key of the hall clock the squire always used to wind it up of a thursday john said <\s>
<s> pendennis's maid brought him messages from her mistress <\s>
<s> she confirmed the doctor's report of the comfort which master arthur's arrival had caused to his mother <\s>
<s> what passed between that lady and the boy is not of import <\s>
<s> a veil should be thrown over those sacred emotions of love and grief <\s>
<s> the maternal passion is a sacred mystery to me <\s>
<s> what one sees symbolised in the roman churches in the image of the virgin mother with a bosom bleeding with love i think one may witness and admire the almighty bounty for every day <\s>
<s> i saw a jewish lady only yesterday with a child at her knee and from whose face towards the child there shone a sweetness so angelical that it seemed to form a sort of glory round both <\s>
<s> i protest i could have knelt before her too and adored in her the divine beneficence in endowing us with the maternal storge which began with our race and sanctifies the history of mankind <\s>
<s> so it was with this in a word that mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis comforted herself on the death of her husband whom however she always reverenced as the best the most upright wise high minded accomplished and awful of men <\s>
<s> if the women did not make idols of us and if they saw us as we see each other would life be bearable or could society go on <\s>
<s> let a man pray that none of his womankind should form a just estimation of him <\s>
<s> if your wife knew you as you are neighbour she would not grieve much about being your widow and would let your grave lamp go out very soon or perhaps not even take the trouble to light it <\s>
<s> whereas helen pendennis put up the handsomest of memorials to her husband and constantly renewed it with the most precious oil <\s>
<s> as for arthur pendennis after that awful shock which the sight of his dead father must have produced on him and the pity and feeling which such an event no doubt occasioned i am not sure that in the very moment of the grief and as he embraced his mother and tenderly consoled her and promised to love her for ever there was not springing up in his breast a feeling of secret triumph and exultation <\s>
<s> he was the chief now and lord <\s>
<s> he was pendennis and all round about him were his servants and handmaids <\s>

<s> arthur kissed her and patted her head <\s>
<s> no she shouldn't go to school <\s>
<s> as for going himself that was quite out of the question <\s>
<s> he had determined that that part of his life should not be renewed <\s>
<s> in the midst of the general grief and the corpse still lying above he had leisure to conclude that he would have it all holidays for the future that he wouldn't get up till he liked or stand the bullying of the doctor any more and had made a hundred of such day dreams and resolves for the future <\s>
<s> how one's thoughts will travel <\s>
<s> and how quickly our wishes beget them <\s>
<s> when he with laura in his hand went into the kitchen on his way to the dog kennel the fowl houses and other his favourite haunts all the servants there assembled in great silence with their friends and the labouring men and their wives and sally potter who went with the post bag to clavering and the baker's man from clavering all there assembled and drinking beer on the melancholy occasion rose up on his entrance and bowed or curtseyed to him <\s>
<s> they never used to do so last holidays he felt at once and with indescribable pleasure <\s>
<s> the cook cried out o lord and whispered how master arthur do grow <\s>
<s> thomas the groom in the act of drinking put down the jug alarmed before his master <\s>

<s> he went through and looked at the pointers <\s>
<s> as flora put her nose up to his waistcoat and ponto yelling with pleasure hurtled at his chain pen patronised the dogs and said poo ponto poo flora in his most condescending manner <\s>
<s> and then he went and looked at laura's hens and at the pigs and at the orchard and at the dairy perhaps he blushed to think that it was only last holidays he had in a manner robbed the great apple tree and been scolded by the dairymaid for taking cream <\s>
<s> they buried john pendennis esquire formerly an eminent medical practitioner at bath and subsequently an able magistrate a benevolent landlord and a benefactor to many charities and public institutions in this neighbourhood and county with one of the most handsome funerals that had been seen since sir roger clavering was buried here the clerk said in the abbey church of clavering st <\s>

<s> his hair was of a healthy brown colour which looks like gold in the sunshine his face was round rosy freckled and good humoured his whiskers when those facial ornaments for which he sighed so ardently were awarded to him by nature were decidedly of a reddish hue in fact without being a beauty he had such a frank good natured kind face and laughed so merrily at you out of his honest blue eyes that no wonder mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis thought him the pride of the whole county <\s>
<s> between the ages of sixteen and eighteen he rose from five feet six to five feet eight inches in height at which altitude he paused <\s>
<s> but his mother wondered at it <\s>
<s> he was three inches taller than his father <\s>
<s> was it possible that any man could grow to be three inches taller than mr <\s>
<s> you may be certain he never went back to school the discipline of the establishment did not suit him and he liked being at home much better <\s>
<s> the question of his return was debated and his uncle was for his going back <\s>
<s> the doctor wrote his opinion that it was most important for arthur's success in after life that he should know a greek play thoroughly but pen adroitly managed to hint to his mother what a dangerous place greyfriars was and what sad wild fellows some of the chaps there were and the timid soul taking alarm at once acceded to his desire to stay at home <\s>
<s> then pen's uncle offered to use his influence with his royal highness the commander in chief who was pleased to be very kind to him and proposed to get pen a commission in the foot guards <\s>

<s> what would not pen have given to wear such epaulettes and enter such a service <\s>

<s> he was a decent scholar and mathematician and taught pen as much as the lad was ever disposed to learn which was not much <\s>
<s> for pen had soon taken the measure of his tutor who when he came riding into the court yard at fairoaks on his pony turned out his toes so absurdly and left such a gap between his knees and the saddle that it was impossible for any lad endowed with a sense of humour to respect such an equestrian <\s>
<s> he nearly killed smirke with terror by putting him on his mare and taking him a ride over a common where the county fox hounds then bunted by that staunch old sportsman mr <\s>
<s> hardhead of dumplingbeare happened to meet <\s>
<s> smirke on pen's mare rebecca she was named after pen's favourite heroine the daughter of isaac of york astounded the hounds as much as he disgusted the huntsman laming one of the former by persisting in riding amongst the pack and receiving a speech from the latter more remarkable for energy of language than any oration he had ever heard since he left the bargemen on the banks of isis <\s>
<s> smirke confided to his pupil his poems both latin and english and presented to mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis a volume of the latter printed at clapham his native place <\s>
<s> the two read the ancient poets together and rattled through them at a pleasant rate very different from that steady grubbing pace with which the cistercians used to go over the classic ground scenting out each word as they went and digging up every root in the way <\s>
<s> pen never liked to halt but made his tutor construe when he was at fault and thus galloped through the iliad and the odyssey the tragic playwriters writers and the charming wicked aristophanes whom he vowed to be the greatest poet of all <\s>
<s> but he went at such a pace that though he certainly galloped through a considerable extent of the ancient country he clean forgot it in after life and had only such a vague remembrance of his early classic course as a man has in the house of commons let us say who still keeps up two or three quotations or a reviewer who just for decency's sake hints at a little greek <\s>
<s> our people are the most prosaic in the world but the most faithful and with curious reverence we keep up and transmit from generation to generation the superstition of what we call the education of a gentleman <\s>
<s> besides the ancient poets you may be sure pen read the english with great gusto <\s>
<s> smirke sighed and shook his head sadly both about byron and moore <\s>
<s> but pen was a sworn fire worshipper and a corsair he had them by heart and used to take little laura into the window and say zuleika i am not thy brother in tones so tragic that they caused the solemn little maid to open her great eyes still wider <\s>

<s> pendennis's knee and listening to pen reading out to her of nights without comprehending one word of what he read <\s>

<s> the son and the mother whispered it to each other with awe faint very faint and seldom in after life pendennis heard that solemn church music but he always loved the remembrance of it and of the times when it struck on his heart and he walked over the fields full of hope and void of doubt as the church bells rang on sunday morning <\s>
<s> it was at this period of his existence that pen broke out in the poets corner of the county chronicle with some verses with which he was perfectly well satisfied <\s>
<s> his are the verses signed nep addressed to a tear on the anniversary of the battle of waterloo to madame caradori singing at the assize meetings on saint bartholomew's day a tremendous denunciation of popery and a solemn warning to the people of england to rally against emancipating the roman catholics etc etc all which masterpieces mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis no doubt keeps to this day along with his first socks the first cutting of his hair his bottle and other interesting relics of his infancy <\s>
<s> he used to gallop rebecca over the neighbouring dumpling downs or into the county town which if you please we shall call chatteris spouting his own poems and filled with quite a byronic afflatus as he thought <\s>
<s> his genius at this time was of a decidedly gloomy cast <\s>
<s> he brought his mother a tragedy in which though he killed sixteen people before the second act it made her laugh so that he thrust the masterpiece into the fire in a pet <\s>
<s> he projected an epic poem in blank verse cortez or the conqueror of mexico and the inca's daughter <\s>
<s> he wrote part of seneca or the fatal bath and ariadne in naxos classical pieces with choruses and strophes and antistrophes which sadly puzzled poor mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis and began a history of the jesuits in which he lashed that order with tremendous severity and warned his protestant fellow countrymen of their machinations <\s>
<s> his loyalty did his mother's heart good to witness <\s>
<s> he was a staunch unflinching church and king man in those days and at the election when sir giles beanfield stood on the blue interest against lord trehawk lord eyrie's son a whig and a friend of popery arthur pendennis with an immense bow for himself which his mother made and with a blue ribbon for rebecca rode alongside of the reverend doctor portman on his grey mare dowdy and at the head of the clavering voters whom the doctor brought up to plump for the protestant champion <\s>
<s> on that day pen made his first speech at the blue hotel and also it appears for the first time in his life took a little more wine than was good for him <\s>

<s> what moving about of lanterns in the court yard and stables though the moon was shining out what a gathering of servants as pen came home clattering over the bridge and up the stableyard with half a score of the clavering voters yelling after him the blue song of the election <\s>

<s> besides these amusements and occupations in which mr <\s>

<s> pen sighed for it first in secret and like the love sick swain in ovid opened his breast and said aura veni <\s>
<s> what generous youth is there that has not courted some such windy mistress in his time <\s>
<s> yes pen began to feel the necessity of a first love of a consuming passion of an object on which he could concentrate all those vague floating fancies under which he sweetly suffered of a young lady to whom he could really make verses and whom he could set up and adore in place of those unsubstantial ianthes and zuleikas to whom he addressed the outpourings of his gushing muse <\s>
<s> he read his favourite poems over and over again he called upon alma venus the delight of gods and men he translated anacreon's odes and picked out passages suitable to his complaint from waller dryden prior and the like <\s>

<s> here they would talk about helen and andromache <\s>
<s> andromache's like my mother pen used to avouch but i say smirke by jove i'd cut off my nose to see helen and he would spout certain favourite lines which the reader will find in their proper place in the third book <\s>
<s> he drew portraits of her they are extant still with straight noses and enormous eyes and arthur pendennis delineavit et pinxit gallantly written underneath <\s>
<s> smirke he naturally preferred andromache <\s>
<s> and in consequence he was uncommonly kind to pen <\s>
<s> he gave him his elzevir horace of which the boy was fond and his little greek testament which his own mamma at clapham had purchased and presented to him <\s>
<s> he bought him a silver pencil case and in the matter of learning let him do just as much or as little as ever he pleased <\s>
<s> he always seemed to be on the point of unbosoming himself to pen nay he confessed to the latter that he had a an attachment an ardently cherished attachment about which pendennis longed to hear and said tell us old chap is she handsome <\s>
<s> has she got blue eyes or black <\s>
<s> but doctor portman's curate heaving a gentle sigh cast up his eyes to the ceiling and begged pen faintly to change the conversation <\s>

<s> pendennis was never tired of hearing the praises of her son we may be certain that this rogue of a tutor neglected no opportunity of conversing with her upon that subject <\s>
<s> it might be a little tedious to him to hear the stories about pen's generosity about his bravery in fighting the big naughty boy about his fun and jokes about his prodigious skill in latin music riding etc but what price would he not pay to be in her company <\s>

<s> smirke a very pleasing and well informed man <\s>

<s> a simple person of inexpensive habits she began forthwith to save and perhaps to be a little parsimonious in favour of her boy <\s>

<s> nor indeed did the doctor's silver dish covers of which he was so proud and which were flourished all over with the arms of the pendennises and surmounted with their crest come out of the plate chests again for long long years <\s>
<s> the household was diminished and its expenses curtailed <\s>
<s> there was a very blank anchorite repast when pen dined from home and he himself headed the remonstrance from the kitchen regarding the deteriorated quality of the fairoaks beer <\s>

<s> they are always sacrificing themselves or somebody for somebody else's sake <\s>
<s> there happened to be no young woman in the small circle of friends who were in the widow's intimacy whom pendennis could by any possibility gratify by endowing her with the inestimable treasure of a heart which he was longing to give away <\s>

<s> pen thought a pendennis much too grand a personage to stoop so low <\s>

<s> while these natural sentiments were waging war and trouble in honest pen's bosom it chanced one day that he rode into chatteris for the purpose of carrying to the county chronicle a tremendous and thrilling poem for the next week's paper and putting up his horse according to custom at the stables of the george hotel there he fell in with an old acquaintance <\s>

<s> rincer with that sort of good nature with which a young prince addresses his father's subjects never dreaming that those bonnes gens were his equals in life <\s>

<s> rincer a riddle asked miss rincer when she would be ready to marry him and paid his compliments to miss brett the other young lady in the bar all in a minute of time and with a liveliness and facetiousness which set all these ladies in a giggle and he gave a cluck expressive of great satisfaction as he tossed off his mixture which miss rincer prepared and handed to him <\s>
<s> have a drop said he to pen it's recommended to me by the faculty as a what do you call 'em a stomatic old boy <\s>

<s> he was reading out of the stage book that wonderful stage book which is not bound like any other book in the world but is rouged and tawdry like the hero or heroine who holds it and who holds it as people never do hold books and points with his finger to a passage and wags his head ominously at the audience and then lifts up eyes and finger to the ceiling professing to derive some intense consolation from the work between which and heaven there is a strong affinity <\s>

<s> more applause more umbrellas pen this time flaming with wine and enthusiasm clapped hands and sang bravo louder than all <\s>
<s> haller saw him and everybody else and old mr <\s>
<s> bows the little first fiddler of the orchestra which was this night increased by a detachment of the band of the dragoons by the kind permission of colonel swallowtail looked up from the desk where he was perched with his crutch beside him and smiled at the enthusiasm of the lad <\s>
<s> those who have only seen miss fotheringay in later days since her marriage and introduction into london life have little idea how beautiful a creature she was at the time when our friend pen first set eyes on her and i warn my reader as beforehand that the pencil which illustrates this work and can draw an ugly face tolerably well but is sadly put out when it tries to delineate a beauty can give no sort of notion of her <\s>
<s> she was of the tallest of women and at her then age of six and twenty for six and twenty she was though she vows she was only nineteen in the prime and fulness of her beauty <\s>
<s> her forehead was vast and her black hair waved over it with a natural ripple that beauties of late days have tried to imitate with the help of the crimping irons and was confined in shining and voluminous braids at the back of a neck such as you see on the shoulders of the louvre venus that delight of gods and men <\s>
<s> her eyes when she lifted them up to gaze on you and ere she dropped their purple deep fringed lids shone with tenderness and mystery unfathomable <\s>
<s> love and genius seemed to look out from them and then retire coyly as if ashamed to have been seen at the lattice <\s>
<s> who could have had such a commanding brow but a woman of high intellect <\s>
<s> she never laughed indeed her teeth were not good but a smile of endless tenderness and sweetness played round her beautiful lips and in the dimples of her cheeks and her lovely chin <\s>
<s> her nose defied description in those days <\s>
<s> her ears were like two little pearl shells which the earrings she wore though the handsomest properties in the theatre only insulted <\s>
<s> she was dressed in long flowing robes of black which she managed and swept to and fro with wonderful grace and out of the folds of which you only saw her sandals occasionally they were of rather a large size but pen thought them as ravishing as the slippers of cinderella <\s>
<s> but it was her hand and arm that this magnificent creature most excelled in and somehow you could never see her but through them <\s>
<s> when she folded them over her bosom in resignation when she dropped them in mute agony or raised them in superb command when in sportive gaiety her hands fluttered and waved before her like what shall we say like the snowy doves before the chariot of venus it was with these arms and hands that she beckoned repelled entreated embraced her admirers no single one for she was armed with her own virtue and with her father's valour whose sword would have leapt from its scabbard at any insult offered to his child but the whole house which rose to her as the phrase was as she curtseyed and bowed and charmed it <\s>
<s> thus she stood for a minute complete and beautiful as pen stared at her <\s>
<s> i say pen isn't she a stunner <\s>
<s> pen said she's speaking <\s>
<s> she began her business in a deep sweet voice <\s>
<s> those who know the play of the stranger are aware that the remarks made by the various characters are not valuable in themselves either for their sound sense their novelty of observation or their poetic fancy <\s>
<s> in fact if a man were to say it was a stupid play he would not be far wrong <\s>
<s> nobody ever talked so <\s>
<s> if we meet idiots in life as will happen it is a great mercy that they do not use such absurdly fine words <\s>
<s> the stranger's talk is sham like the book he reads and the hair he wears and the bank he sits on and the diamond ring he makes play with but in the midst of the balderdash there runs that reality of love children and forgiveness of wrong which will be listened to wherever it is preached and sets all the world sympathising <\s>
<s> with what smothered sorrow with what gushing pathos mrs <\s>
<s> haller delivered her part <\s>
<s> at first when as count wintersen's housekeeper and preparing for his excellency's arrival she has to give orders about the beds and furniture and the dinner etc to be got ready she did so with the calm agony of despair <\s>
<s> but when she could get rid of the stupid servants and give vent to her feelings to the pit and the house she overflowed to each individual as if he were her particular confidant and she was crying out her griefs on his shoulder the little fiddler in the orchestra whom she did not seem to watch though he followed her ceaselessly twitched twisted nodded pointed about and when she came to the favourite passage i have a william too if he be still alive ah yes if he be still alive <\s>
<s> his little sisters too <\s>
<s> why fancy dost thou rack me so <\s>
<s> why dost thou image my poor children fainting in sickness and crying to to their mum um other when she came to this passage little bows buried his face in his blue cotton handkerchief after crying out bravo <\s>
<s> all the house was affected <\s>
<s> foker for his part taking out a large yellow bandanna wept piteously <\s>
<s> as for pen he was gone too far for that <\s>
<s> he followed the woman about and about when she was off the stage it and the house were blank the lights and the red officers reeled wildly before his sight <\s>
<s> he watched her at the side scene where she stood waiting to come on the stage and where her father took off her shawl when the reconciliation arrived and she flung herself down on mr <\s>
<s> bingley's shoulders whilst the children clung to their knees and the countess mrs <\s>
<s> bingley and baron steinforth performed with great liveliness and spirit by garbetts while the rest of the characters formed a group round them pen's hot eyes only saw fotheringay fotheringay <\s>
<s> the curtain fell upon him like a pall <\s>
<s> he did not hear a word of what bingley said who came forward to announce the play for the next evening and who took the tumultuous applause as usual for himself <\s>
<s> pen was not even distinctly aware that the house was calling for miss fotheringay nor did the manager seem to comprehend that anybody else but himself had caused the success of the play <\s>
<s> at last he understood it stepped back with a grin and presently appeared with mrs <\s>
<s> haller on his arm <\s>
<s> how beautiful she looked <\s>
<s> her hair had fallen down the officers threw her flowers <\s>
<s> she clutched them to her heart <\s>
<s> she put back her hair and smiled all round <\s>
<s> her eyes met pen's <\s>
<s> down went the curtain again and she was gone <\s>
<s> not one note could he hear of the overture which the brass band of the dragoons blew by kind permission of colonel swallowtail <\s>
<s> she is a crusher ain't she now <\s>
<s> foker asked of his companion <\s>
<s> pen did not know exactly what foker said and answered vaguely <\s>
<s> he could not tell the other what he felt he could not have spoken just then to any mortal <\s>
<s> besides pendennis did not quite know what he felt yet it was something overwhelming maddening delicious a fever of wild joy and undefined longing <\s>
<s> and now rowkins and miss thackthwaite came on to dance the favourite double hornpipe and foker abandoned himself to the delights of this ballet just as he had to the tears of the tragedy a few minutes before <\s>
<s> pen did not care for it or indeed think about the dance except to remember that that woman was acting with her in the scene where she first came in <\s>
<s> it was a mist before his eyes <\s>
<s> at the end of the dance he looked at his watch and said it was time for him to go <\s>
<s> hang it stay to see the bravo of the battle axe foker said bingley's splendid in it he wears red tights and has to carry mrs <\s>
<s> over the pine bridge of the cataract only she's too heavy <\s>
<s> it's great fun do stop <\s>
<s> pen looked at the bill with one lingering fond hope that miss fotheringay's name might be hidden somewhere in the list of the actors of the after piece but there was no such name <\s>
<s> he had a long ride home <\s>
<s> he squeezed foker's hand <\s>
<s> he was choking to speak but he couldn't <\s>
<s> he quitted the theatre and walked frantically about the town he knew not how long then he mounted at the george and rode homewards and clavering clock sang out one as he came into the yard at fairoaks <\s>
<s> the lady of the house might have been awake but she only heard him from the passage outside his room as he dashed into bed and pulled the clothes over his head <\s>
<s> pen had not been in the habit of passing wakeful nights so he at once fell off into a sound sleep <\s>
<s> even in later days and with a great deal of care and other thoughtful matter to keep him awake a man from long practice or fatigue or resolution begins by going to sleep as usual and gets a nap in advance of anxiety <\s>
<s> but she soon comes up with him and jogs his shoulder and says come my man no more of this laziness you must wake up and have a talk with me <\s>
<s> then they fall to together in the midnight <\s>
<s> well whatever might afterwards happen to him poor little pen was not come to this state yet he tumbled into a sound sleep did not wake until an early hour in the morning when the rooks began to caw from the little wood beyond his bedroom windows and at that very instant and as his eyes started open the beloved image was in his mind <\s>
<s> my dear boy he heard her say you were in a sound sleep and i would not disturb you but i have been close by your pillow all this while and i don't intend that you shall leave me <\s>
<s> i bring with me fever and passion wild longing maddening desire restless craving and seeking <\s>
<s> many a long day ere this i heard you calling out for me and behold now i am come <\s>
<s> was pen frightened at the summons <\s>
<s> he did not know what was coming it was all wild pleasure and delight as yet <\s>
<s> and as when three years previously and on entering the fifth form at the cistercians his father had made him a present of a gold watch which the boy took from under his pillow and examined on the instant of waking for ever rubbing and polishing it up in private and retiring into corners to listen to its ticking so the young man exulted over his new delight felt in his waistcoat pocket to see that it was safe wound it up at nights and at the very first moment of waking hugged it and looked at it by the way that first watch of pen's was a showy ill manufactured piece it never went well from the beginning and was always getting out of order <\s>
<s> and after putting it aside into a drawer and forgetting it for some time he swapped it finally away for a more useful time keeper <\s>
<s> pen felt himself to be ever so many years older since yesterday <\s>
<s> there was no mistake about it now <\s>
<s> he was as much in love as the best hero in the best romance he ever read <\s>
<s> he told john to bring his shaving water with the utmost confidence <\s>
<s> he dressed himself in some of his finest clothes that morning and came splendidly down to breakfast patronising his mother and little laura who had been strumming her music lesson for hours before and who after he had read the prayers of which he did not heed one single syllable wondered at his grand appearance and asked him to tell her what the play was about <\s>
<s> pen laughed and declined to tell laura what the play was about <\s>
<s> in fact it was quite as well that she should not know <\s>
<s> then she asked him why he had got on his fine pin and beautiful new waistcoat <\s>
<s> pen blushed and told his mother that the old schoolfellow with whom he had dined at chatteris was reading with a tutor at baymouth a very learned man and as he was himself to go to college and as there were several young men pursuing their studies at baymouth he was anxious to ride over and and just see what the course of their reading was <\s>
<s> laura made a long face <\s>
<s> helen pendennis looked hard at her son troubled more than ever with the vague doubt and terror which had been haunting her ever since the last night when farmer gurnett brought back the news that pen would not return home to dinner <\s>
<s> arthur's eyes defied her <\s>
<s> she tried to console herself and drive off her fears <\s>
<s> the boy had never told her an untruth <\s>
<s> pen conducted himself during breakfast in a very haughty and supercilious manner and taking leave of the elder and younger lady was presently heard riding out of the stablecourt <\s>
<s> he went gently at first but galloped like a madman as soon as he thought that he was out of hearing <\s>
<s> smirke thinking of his own affairs and softly riding with his toes out to give pen his three hours reading at fairoaks met his pupil who shot by him like the wind <\s>
<s> smirke's pony shied as the other thundered past him the gentle curate went over his head among the stinging nettles in the hedge <\s>
<s> pen laughed as they met pointed towards the baymouth road and was gone half a mile in that direction before poor smirke had picked himself up <\s>
<s> pen had resolved in his mind that he must see foker that morning he must hear about her know about her be with somebody who knew her and honest smirke for his part sitting up among the stinging nettles as his pony cropped quietly in the hedge thought dismally to himself ought he to go to fairoaks now that his pupil was evidently gone away for the day <\s>
<s> yes he thought he might go too <\s>
<s> he might go and ask mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis when arthur would be back and hear miss laura her watts's catechism <\s>
<s> he got up on the little pony both were used to his slipping off and advanced upon the house from which his scholar had just rushed away in a whirlwind <\s>
<s> thus love makes fools of all of us big and little and the curate had tumbled over head and heels in pursuit of it and pen had started in the first heat of the mad race <\s>
<s> haller at home without slackening her pace rebecca the mare galloped on to baymouth where pen put her up at the inn stables and ran straightway to mr <\s>
<s> foker's lodgings which he knew from the direction given to him by that gentleman on the previous day <\s>
<s> on reaching these apartments which were over a chemist's shop whose stock of cigars and sodawater went off rapidly by the kind patronage of his young inmates pen only found mr <\s>
<s> spavin foker's friend and part owner of the tandem which the latter had driven into chatteris who was smoking and teaching a little dog a friend of his tricks with a bit of biscuit <\s>
<s> pen's healthy red face fresh from the gallop compared oddly with the waxy debauched little features of foker's chum the latter remarked it <\s>
<s> he thought he looks as fresh as a bean <\s>
<s> his hand don't shake of a morning i'd bet five to one <\s>
<s> foker had not come home at all <\s>
<s> here was a disappointment mr <\s>
<s> spavin could not say when his friend would return <\s>
<s> sometimes he stopped a day sometimes a week <\s>
<s> of what college was pen <\s>
<s> would he have anything <\s>
<s> there was a very fair tap of ale <\s>
<s> spavin was enabled to know pendennis's name on the card which the latter took out and laid down perhaps pen in these days was rather proud of having a card and so the young men took leave <\s>
<s> then pen went down the rock and walked about on the sand biting his nails by the shore of the much sounding sea <\s>
<s> it stretched before him bright and immeasurable <\s>
<s> the blue waters came rolling into the bay foaming and roaring hoarsely pen looked them in the face with blank eyes hardly regarding them <\s>
<s> what a tide there was pouring into the lad's own mind at the time and what a little power had he to check it <\s>
<s> pen flung stones into the sea but it still kept coming on <\s>
<s> he was in a rage at not seeing foker <\s>
<s> he wanted to see foker <\s>
<s> he must see foker <\s>
<s> suppose i go on on the chatteris road just to see if i can meet him pen thought <\s>
<s> rebecca was saddled in another half hour and galloping on the grass by the chatteris road <\s>
<s> about four miles from baymouth the clavering road branches off as everybody knows and the mare naturally was for taking that turn but cutting her over the shoulder pen passed the turning and rode on to the turnpike without seeing any sign of the black tandem and red wheels <\s>
<s> as he was at the turnpike he might as well go on that was quite clear <\s>
<s> so pen rode to the george and the hostler told him that mr <\s>
<s> foker was there sure enough and that he'd been a makin a tremendous row the night afore a drinkin and a singin and wanting to fight tom the postboy which i'm thinking he'd have had the worst of it the man added with a grin <\s>
<s> have you carried up your master's ot water to shave with <\s>
<s> he added in a very satirical manner to mr <\s>
<s> foker's domestic who here came down the yard bearing his master's clothes most beautifully brushed and arranged <\s>
<s> pendennis up to un and pen followed the man at last to the apartment where in the midst of an immense bed mr <\s>
<s> harry foker lay reposing <\s>
<s> the feather bed and bolsters swelled up all round mr <\s>
<s> foker so that you could hardly see his little sallow face and red silk nightcap <\s>
<s> sang out the voice from the bed <\s>
<s> is your mamma acquainted with your absence <\s>
<s> did you sup with us last night <\s>
<s> no stop who supped with us last night stoopid <\s>
<s> there was the three officers sir and mr <\s>
<s> bingley sir and mr <\s>
<s> costigan sir the man answered who received all mr <\s>
<s> foker's remarks with perfect gravity <\s>
<s> ah yes the cup and merry jest went round <\s>
<s> we chanted and i remember i wanted to fight a postboy <\s>
<s> did i thrash him stoopid <\s>
<s> fight didn't come off sir said stoopid still with perfect gravity <\s>
<s> he was arranging mr <\s>
<s> foker's dressing case a trunk the gift of a fond mother without which the young fellow never travelled <\s>
<s> it contained a prodigious apparatus in plate a silver dish a silver mug silver boxes and bottles for all sorts of essences and a choice of razors ready against the time when mr <\s>
<s> foker's beard should come <\s>
<s> do it some other day said the young fellow yawning and throwing up his little lean arms over his head <\s>
<s> no there was no fight but there was chanting <\s>
<s> bingley chanted i chanted the general chanted costigan i mean did you ever hear him sing the little pig under the bed pen <\s>
<s> the man we met yesterday said pen all in a tremor the father of of the fotheringay the very man <\s>
<s> ain't she a venus pen <\s>
<s> costigan's in the sittin room sir and says sir you asked him to breakfast sir <\s>
<s> called five times sir but wouldn't wake you on no account and has been here since eleven o'clock sir how much is it now <\s>
<s> what would the best of mothers say cried the little sluggard if she saw me in bed at this hour <\s>
<s> she sent me down here with a grinder <\s>
<s> she wants me to cultivate my neglected genus he be <\s>
<s> i say pen this isn't quite like seven o'clock school is it old boy and the young fellow burst out into a boyish laugh of enjoyment <\s>
<s> then he added go in and talk to the general whilst i dress <\s>
<s> and i say pendennis ask him to sing you the little pig under the bed it's capital <\s>
<s> pen went off in great perturbation to meet mr <\s>
<s> foker commenced his toilet <\s>
<s> foker's two grandfathers the one from whom he inherited a fortune was a brewer the other was an earl who endowed him with the most doting mother in the world <\s>
<s> the fokers had been at the cistercian school from father to son at which place our friend whose name could be seen over the playground wall on a public house sign under which foker's entire was painted had been dreadfully bullied on account of his trade his uncomely countenance his inaptitude for learning and cleanliness his gluttony and other weak points <\s>
<s> but those who know how a susceptible youth under the tyranny of his schoolfellows becomes silent and a sneak may understand how in a very few months after his liberation from bondage he developed himself as he had done and became the humorous the sarcastic the brilliant foker with whom we have made acquaintance <\s>
<s> a dunce he always was it is true for learning cannot be acquired by leaving school and entering at college as a fellow commoner but he was now in his own peculiar manner as great a dandy as he before had been a slattern and when he entered his sitting room to join his two guests arrived scented and arrayed in fine linen and perfectly splendid in appearance <\s>
<s> general or captain costigan for the latter was the rank which he preferred to assume was seated in the window with the newspaper held before him at arm's length <\s>
<s> the captain's eyes were somewhat dim and he was spelling the paper with the help of his lips as well as of those bloodshot eyes of his as you see gentlemen do to whom reading is a rare and difficult occupation <\s>
<s> his hat was cocked very much on one ear and as one of his feet lay up in the window seat the observer of such matters might remark by the size and shabbiness of the boots which the captain wore that times did not go very well with him <\s>
<s> poverty seems as if it were disposed before it takes possession of a man entirely to attack his extremities first the coverings of his head feet and hands are its first prey <\s>
<s> all these parts of the captain's person were particularly rakish and shabby <\s>
<s> as soon as he saw pen he descended from the window seat and saluted the new comer first in a military manner by conveying a couple of his fingers covered with a broken black glove to his hat and then removing that ornament altogether <\s>
<s> the captain was inclined to be bald but he brought a quantity of lank iron grey hair over his pate and had a couple of whisps of the same falling down on each side of his face <\s>
<s> much whisky had spoiled what complexion mr <\s>
<s> costigan may have possessed in his youth <\s>
<s> his once handsome face had now a copper tinge <\s>
<s> he wore a very high stock scarred and stained in many places and a dress coat tightly buttoned up in those parts where the buttons had not parted company from the garment <\s>
<s> the young gentleman to whom i had the honour to be introjuiced yesterday in the cathadral yard said the captain with a splendid bow and wave of his hat <\s>
<s> i hope i see you well sir <\s>
<s> i marked ye in the thayatre last night during me daughter's perfawrumance and missed ye on my return <\s>
<s> i did but conduct her home sir for jack costigan though poor is a gentleman and when i reintered the house to pay me respects to me joyous young friend mr <\s>
<s> we had a jolly night of ut sir mr <\s>
<s> foker the three gallant young dragoons and your umble servant <\s>
<s> gad sir it put me in mind of one of our old nights when i bore his majesty's commission in the foighting hundtherd and third <\s>
<s> and he pulled out an old snuff box which he presented with a stately air to his new acquaintance <\s>
<s> arthur was a great deal too much flurried to speak <\s>
<s> this shabby looking buck was was her father <\s>
<s> the captain was perfumed with the recollections of the last night's cigars and pulled and twisted the tuft on his chin as jauntily as any young dandy <\s>
<s> i hope miss f miss costigan is well sir pen said flushing up <\s>
<s> she she gave me greater pleasure than than i i i ever enjoyed at a play <\s>
<s> i think sir i think she's the finest actress in the world he gasped out <\s>
<s> your hand young man <\s>
<s> for ye speak from your heart cried the captain <\s>
<s> thank ye sir an old soldier and a fond father thanks ye <\s>
<s> she is the finest actress in the world <\s>
<s> i've seen the siddons sir and the o'nale they were great but what were they compared to miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> i do not wish she should ashume her own name while on the stage <\s>
<s> me family sir are proud people and the costigans of costiganstown think that an honest man who has borne her majesty's colours in the hundred and third would demean himself by permitting his daughter to earn her old father's bread <\s>
<s> there cannot be a more honourable duty surely pen said <\s>
<s> bedad sir i'd like to see the man who said jack costigan would consent to anything dishonourable <\s>
<s> i have a heart sir though i am poor i like a man who has a heart <\s>
<s> you have i read it in your honest face and steady eye <\s>
<s> and would you believe it <\s>
<s> he added after a pause and with a pathetic whisper that that bingley who has made his fortune by me child gives her but two guineas a week out of which she finds herself in dresses and which added to me own small means makes our all <\s>
<s> now the captain's means were so small as to be it may be said quite invisible <\s>
<s> but nobody knows how the wind is tempered to shorn irish lambs and in what marvellous places they find pasture <\s>
<s> if captain costigan whom i had the honour to know would but have told his history it would have been a great moral story <\s>
<s> but he neither would have told it if he could nor could if he would for the captain was not only unaccustomed to tell the truth he was unable even to think it and fact and fiction reeled together in his muzzy whiskified brain <\s>
<s> he began life rather brilliantly with a pair of colours a fine person and legs and one of the most beautiful voices in the world <\s>
<s> to his latest day he sang with admirable pathos and humour those wonderful irish ballads which are so mirthful and so melancholy and was always the first himself to cry at their pathos <\s>
<s> he was at once brave and maudlin humorous and an idiot always good natured and sometimes almost trustworthy <\s>
<s> up to the last day of his life he would drink with any man and back any man's bill and his end was in a spunging house where the sheriff's officer who took him was fond of him <\s>
<s> in his brief morning of life cos formed the delight of regimental messes and had the honour of singing his songs bacchanalian and sentimental at the tables of the most illustrious generals and commanders in chief in the course of which period he drank three times as much claret as was good for him and spent his doubtful patrimony <\s>
<s> what became of him subsequently to his retirement from the army is no affair of ours <\s>
<s> i take it no foreigner understands the life of an irish gentleman without money the way in which he manages to keep afloat the wind raising conspiracies in which he engages with heroes as unfortunate as himself the means by which he contrives during most days of the week to get his portion of whisky and water all these are mysteries to us inconceivable but suffice it to say that through all the storms of life jack had floated somehow and the lamp of his nose had never gone out <\s>
<s> before he and pen had had a half hour's conversation the captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughter's benefit which was to take place speedily and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year when poor miss fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture but was an arrangement with the manager by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold <\s>
<s> pen had but two pounds in his purse and he handed them over to the captain for the tickets he would have been afraid to offer more lest he should offend the latter's delicacy <\s>
<s> costigan scrawled him an order for a box lightly slipped the sovereigns into his waistcoat and slapped his hand over the place where they lay <\s>
<s> they seemed to warm his old sides <\s>
<s> faith sir said he the bullion's scarcer with me than it used to be as is the case with many a good fellow <\s>
<s> i won six hundthred of em in a single night sir when me kind friend his royal highness the duke of kent was in gibralther <\s>
<s> and he straightway poured out to pen a series of stories regarding the claret drunk the bets made the races ridden by the garrison there with which he kept the young gentleman amused until the arrival of their host and his breakfast <\s>
<s> then it was good to see the captain's behaviour before the devilled turkey and the mutton chops <\s>
<s> his stories poured forth unceasingly and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men <\s>
<s> when he got a bit of sunshine the old lazzarone basked in it he prated about his own affairs and past splendour and all the lords generals and lord lieutenants he had ever known <\s>
<s> he described the death of his darling bessie the late mrs <\s>
<s> costigan and the challenge he had sent to captain shanty clancy of the slashers for looking rude at miss fotheringay as she was on her kyar in the phaynix and then he described how the captain apologised gave a dinner at the kildare street where six of them drank twinty one bottles of claret etc <\s>
<s> he announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldier's existence and having had a second glass of curacoa was so happy that he began to cry <\s>
<s> altogether we should say that the captain was not a man of much strength of mind or a very eligible companion for youth but there are worse men holding much better places in life and more dishonest who have never committed half so many rogueries as he <\s>
<s> they walked out the captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends and in a maudlin state of contentment <\s>
<s> he winked at one or two tradesmen's shops where possibly he owed a bill as much as to say see the company i'm in sure i'll pay you my boy and they parted finally with mr <\s>
<s> foker at a billiard room where the latter had a particular engagement with some gentlemen of colonel swallowtail's regiment <\s>
<s> pen and the shabby captain still walked the street together the captain in his sly way making inquiries about mr <\s>
<s> foker's fortune and station in life <\s>
<s> pen told him how foker's father was a celebrated brewer and his mother was lady agnes milton lord rosherville's daughter <\s>
<s> the captain broke out into a strain of exaggerated compliment and panegyric about mr <\s>
<s> foker whose native aristocracie he said could be seen with the twinkling of an oi and only served to adawrun other qualities which he possessed a foin intellect and a generous heart in not one word of which speech did the captain accurately believe <\s>
<s> pen walked on listening to his companion's prate wondering amused and puzzled <\s>
<s> it had not as yet entered into the boy's head to disbelieve any statement that was made to him and being of a candid nature himself he took naturally for truth what other people told him <\s>
<s> costigan had never had a better listener and was highly flattered by the attentiveness and modest bearing of the young man <\s>
<s> so much pleased was he with the young gentleman so artless honest and cheerful did pen seem to be that the captain finally made him an invitation which he very seldom accorded to young men and asked pen if he would do him the fever to enter his humble abode which was near at hand where the captain would have the honour of inthrojuicing his young friend to his daughther miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> pen was so delightfully shocked at this invitation and was so stricken down by the happiness thus suddenly offered to him that he thought he should have dropped from the captain's arm at first and trembled lest the other should discover his emotion <\s>
<s> he gasped out a few incoherent words indicative of the high gratification he should have in being presented to the lady for whose for whose talents he had conceived such an admiration such an extreme admiration and followed the captain scarcely knowing whither that gentleman led him <\s>
<s> he was going to see her <\s>
<s> he was going to see her <\s>
<s> in her was the centre of the universe <\s>
<s> she was the kernel of the world for pen <\s>
<s> yesterday before he knew her seemed a period ever so long ago a revolution was between him and that time and a new world about to begin <\s>
<s> the captain conducted his young friend to that quiet little street in chatteris which is called prior's lane which lies in the ecclesiastical quarter of the town close by dean's green and the canons houses and is overlooked by the enormous towers of the cathedral there the captain dwelt modestly in the first floor of a low gabled house on the door of which was the brass plate of creed tailor and robe maker <\s>
<s> creed was dead however <\s>
<s> his widow was a pew opener in the cathedral hard by his eldest son was a little scamp of a choir boy who played toss halfpenny led his little brothers into mischief and had a voice as sweet as an angel <\s>
<s> a couple of the latter were sitting on the door step down which you went into the passage of the house and they jumped up with great alacrity to meet their lodger and plunged wildly and rather to pen's surprise at the swallow tails of the captain's dress coat for the truth is that the good natured gentleman when he was in cash generally brought home an apple or a piece of gingerbread for these children <\s>
<s> whereby the widdy never pressed me for rint when not convanient as he remarked afterwards to pen winking knowingly and laying a finger on his nose <\s>
<s> pen tumbled down the step and as he followed his companion up the creaking old stair his knees trembled under him <\s>
<s> he could hardly see when he entered following the captain and stood in the room in her room <\s>
<s> he saw something black before him and waving as if making a curtsey and heard but quite indistinctly costigan making a speech over him in which the captain with his usual magniloquence expressed to me child his wish to make her known to his dear and admirable young friend mr <\s>
<s> awther pindinnis a young gentleman of property in the neighbourhood a person of refoined moind and enviable manners a sincare lover of poethry and a man possest of a feeling and affectionate heart <\s>
<s> it is very fine weather miss fotheringay said in an irish accent and with a deep rich melancholy voice <\s>
<s> in this romantic way their conversation began and he found himself seated on a chair and having leisure to look at the young lady <\s>
<s> she looked still handsomer off the stage than before the lamps <\s>
<s> all her attitudes were naturally grand and majestical <\s>
<s> if she went and stood up against the mantelpiece her robe draped itself classically round her her chin supported itself on her hand the other lines of her form arranged themselves in full harmonious undulations she looked like a muse in contemplation <\s>
<s> if she sate down on a cane bottomed chair her arm rounded itself over the back of the seat her hand seemed as if it ought to have a sceptre put into it the folds of her dress fell naturally round her in order like ladies of honour round a throne and she looked like an empress <\s>
<s> all her movements were graceful and imperial <\s>
<s> in the morning you could see her hair was blue black her complexion of dazzling fairness with the faintest possible blush flickering as it were in her cheek <\s>
<s> her eyes were grey with prodigious long lashes and as for her mouth mr <\s>
<s> pendennis has given me subsequently to understand that it was of a staring red colour with which the most brilliant geranium sealing wax or guardsman's coat could not vie <\s>
<s> and very warm continued this empress and queen of sheba <\s>
<s> pen again assented and the conversation rolled on in this manner <\s>
<s> she asked costigan whether he had had a pleasant evening at the george and he recounted the supper and the tumblers of punch <\s>
<s> then the father asked her how she had been employing the morning <\s>
<s> bows came said she at ten and we studied ophalia <\s>
<s> it's for the twenty fourth when i hope sir we shall have the honour of seeing ye <\s>
<s> indeed indeed you will mr <\s>
<s> pendennis cried wondering that she should say ophalia and speak with an irish inflection of voice naturally who had not the least hibernian accent on the stage <\s>
<s> i've secured um for your benefit dear said the captain tapping his waistcoat pocket wherein lay pen's sovereigns and winking at pen with one eye at which the boy blushed <\s>
<s> mr  the gentleman's very obleging said mrs <\s>
<s> my name is pendennis said pen blushing <\s>
<s> i i hope you'll you'll remember it <\s>
<s> his heart thumped so as he made this audacious declaration that he almost choked in uttering it <\s>
<s> pendennis she answered slowly and looking him full in the eyes with a glance so straight so clear so bright so killing with a voice so sweet so round so low that the word and the glance shot pen through and through and perfectly transfixed him with pleasure <\s>
<s> i never knew the name was so pretty before pen said <\s>
<s> tis a very pretty name ophelia said <\s>
<s> pentweazle's not a pretty name <\s>
<s> remember papa when we were on the norwich circuit young pentweazle who used to play second old men and married miss rancy the columbine they're both engaged in london now at the queen's and get five pounds a week <\s>
<s> pentweazle wasn't his real name <\s>
<s> twas judkin gave it him i don't know why <\s>
<s> his name was harrington that is his real name was potts fawther a clergyman very respectable <\s>
<s> harrington was in london and got in debt <\s>
<s> ye remember he came out in falkland to mrs <\s>
<s> and a pretty julia she was the captain interposed a woman of fifty and a mother of ten children <\s>
<s> tis you ought to have been julia or my name's not jack costigan <\s>
<s> i didn't take the leading business then miss fotheringay said modestly i wasn't fit for't till bows taught me <\s>
<s> true for you my dear said the captain and bending to pendennis he added rejuiced in circumstances sir i was for some time a fencing master in dublin there's only three men in the empire could touch me with the foil once but jack costigan's getting old and stiff now sir and my daughter had an engagement at the thayater there and twas there that my friend mr <\s>
<s> bows who saw her capabilities and is an uncommon cute man gave her lessons in the dramatic art and made her what ye see <\s>
<s> what have ye done since bows went emily <\s>
<s> sure i've made a pie emily said with perfect simplicity <\s>
<s> she pronounced it poy <\s>
<s> if ye'll try it at four o'clock sir say the word said costigan gallantly <\s>
<s> that girl sir makes the best veal and ham pie in england and i think i can promise ye a glass of punch of the right flavour <\s>
<s> pen had promised to be at home to dinner at six o'clock but the rascal thought he could accommodate pleasure and duty in this point and was only too eager to accept this invitation <\s>
<s> he looked on with delight and wonder whilst ophelia busied herself about the room and prepared for the dinner <\s>
<s> she arranged the glasses and laid and smoothed the little cloth all which duties she performed with a quiet grace and good humour which enchanted her guest more and more <\s>
<s> the poy arrived from the baker's in the hands of one of the little choir boy's brothers at the proper hour and at four o'clock pen found himself at dinner actually at dinner with the greatest tragic actress in the world and her father with the handsomest woman in all creation with his first and only love whom he had adored ever since when ever since yesterday ever since for ever <\s>
<s> he ate a crust of her making he poured her out a glass of beer he saw her drink a glass of punch just one wine glass full out of the tumbler which she mixed for her papa <\s>
<s> she was perfectly good natured and offered to mix one for pendennis too <\s>
<s> it was prodigiously strong pen had never in his life drunk so much spirits and water <\s>
<s> was it the punch or the punch maker who intoxicated him <\s>
<s> during dinner when the captain whom his daughter treated most respectfully ceased prattling about himself and his adventures pen tried to engage the fotheringay in conversation about poetry and about her profession <\s>
<s> he asked her what she thought of ophelia's madness and whether she was in love with hamlet or not <\s>
<s> in love with such a little ojous wretch as that stunted manager of a bingley <\s>
<s> she bristled with indignation at the thought <\s>
<s> pen explained it was not of her he spoke but of ophelia of the play <\s>
<s> oh indeed if no offence was meant none was taken but as for bingley indeed she did not value him not that glass of punch <\s>
<s> pen next tried her on kotzebue <\s>
<s> who was he the author of the play in which she had been performing so admirably <\s>
<s> she did not know that the man's name at the beginning of the book was thompson she said <\s>
<s> pen laughed at her adorable simplicity <\s>
<s> he told her of the melancholy fate of the author of the play and how sand had killed him <\s>
<s> it was for the first time in her life that miss costigan had ever heard of mr <\s>
<s> kotzebue's existence but she looked as if she was very much interested and her sympathy sufficed for honest pen <\s>
<s> and in the midst of this simple conversation the hour and a quarter which poor pen could afford to allow himself passed away only too quickly and he had taken leave he was gone and away on his rapid road homewards on the back of rebecca <\s>
<s> she was called upon to show her mettle in the three journeys which she made that day <\s>
<s> what was that he was talking about the madness of hamlet and the theory of the great german critic on the subject <\s>
<s> emily asked of her father <\s>
<s> deed then i don't know milly dear answered the captain <\s>
<s> we'll ask bows when he comes <\s>
<s> anyhow he's a nice fair spoken pretty young man the lady said how many tickets did he take of you <\s>
<s> faith then he took six and gev me two guineas milly the captain said <\s>
<s> i suppose them young chaps is not too flush of coin <\s>
<s> he's full of book learning miss fotheringay continued <\s>
<s> he he what a droll name indeed now and the poor fellow killed by sand too <\s>
<s> did ye ever hear such a thing <\s>
<s> i'll ask bows about it papa dear <\s>
<s> a queer death sure enough ejaculated the captain and changed the painful theme <\s>
<s> tis an elegant mare the young gentleman rides costigan went on to say and a grand breakfast intirely that young mister foker gave us <\s>
<s> he's good for two private boxes and at leest twenty tickets i should say cried the daughter a prudent lass who always kept her fine eyes on the main chance <\s>
<s> i'll go bail of that answered the papa and so their conversation continued awhile until the tumbler of punch was finished and their hour of departure soon came too for at half past six miss fotheringay was to appear at the theatre again whither her father always accompanied her and stood as we have seen in the side scene watching her and drank spirits and water in the green room with the company there <\s>
<s> how beautiful she is thought pen cantering homewards <\s>
<s> how simple and how tender <\s>
<s> how charming it is to see a woman of her commanding genius busying herself with the delightful though humble offices of domestic life cooking dishes to make her old father comfortable and brewing drink for him with her delicate fingers <\s>
<s> how rude it was of me to begin to talk about professional matters and how well she turned the conversation <\s>
<s> by the way she talked about professional matters herself but then with what fun and humour she told the story of her comrade pentweazle as he was called <\s>
<s> there is no humour like irish humour <\s>
<s> her father is rather tedious but thoroughly amiable and how fine of him giving lessons in fencing after he quitted the army where he was the pet of the duke of kent <\s>
<s> i should like to continue my fencing or i shall forget what angelo taught me <\s>
<s> uncle arthur always liked me to fence he says it is the exercise of a gentleman <\s>
<s> i'll take some lessons of captain costigan <\s>
<s> go along rebecca up the hill old lady <\s>
<s> pendennis pendennis how she spoke the word <\s>
<s> how good how noble how beautiful how perfect she is <\s>
<s> now the reader who has had the benefit of overhearing the entire conversation which pen had with miss fotheringay can judge for himself about the powers of her mind and may perhaps be disposed to think that she has not said anything astonishingly humorous or intellectual in the course of the above interview <\s>
<s> she has married and taken her position in the world as the most spotless and irreproachable lady since and i have had the pleasure of making her acquaintance and must certainly own against my friend pen's opinion that his adored emily is not a clever woman <\s>
<s> the truth is she had not only never heard of kotzebue but she had never heard of farquhar or congreve or any dramatist in whose plays she had not a part and of these dramas she only knew the part which concerned herself <\s>
<s> a wag once told her that dante was born at algiers and asked her which dr <\s>
<s> johnson wrote first irene or every man in his humour <\s>
<s> but she had the best of the joke for she had never heard of irene or every man in his humour or dante or perhaps algiers <\s>
<s> it was all one to her <\s>
<s> she acted what little bows told her where he told her to sob she sobbed where he told her to laugh she laughed <\s>
<s> she gave the tirade or the repartee without the slightest notion of its meaning <\s>
<s> she went to church and goes every sunday with a reputation perfectly intact and was and is as guiltless of sense as of any other crime <\s>
<s> but what did our pen know of these things <\s>
<s> he saw a pair of bright eyes and he believed in them a beautiful image and he fell down and worshipped it <\s>
<s> he supplied the meaning which her words wanted and created the divinity which he loved <\s>
<s> was titania the first who fell in love with an ass or pygmalion the only artist who has gone crazy about a stone <\s>
<s> he had found her he had found what his soul thirsted after <\s>
<s> he flung himself into the stream and drank with all his might <\s>
<s> let those say who have been thirsty once how delicious that first draught is <\s>
<s> as he rode down the avenue towards home pen shrieked with laughter as he saw the reverend mr <\s>
<s> smirke once more coming demurely away from fairoaks on his pony <\s>
<s> smirke had dawdled and stayed at the cottages on the way and then dawdled with laura over her lessons and then looked at mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis's gardens and improvements until he had perfectly bored out that lady and he had taken his leave at the very last minute without that invitation to dinner which he fondly expected <\s>
<s> pen was full of kindness and triumph <\s>
<s> what picked up and sound <\s>
<s> he cried out laughing <\s>
<s> come along back old fellow and eat my dinner i have had mine but we will have a bottle of the old wine and drink her health smirke <\s>
<s> poor smirke turned the pony's head round and jogged along with arthur <\s>
<s> his mother was charmed to see him in such high spirits and welcomed mr <\s>
<s> smirke for his sake when arthur said he had forced the curate back to dine <\s>
<s> he gave a most ludicrous account of the play of the night before and of the acting of bingley the manager in his rickety hessians and the enormous mrs <\s>
<s> bingley as the countess in rumpled green satin and a polish cap he mimicked them and delighted his mother and little laura who clapped her hands with pleasure <\s>
<s> she's a stunner ma'am pen said laughing and using the words of his revered friend mr <\s>
<s> what is a stunner arthur <\s>
<s> cried laura in the same voice <\s>
<s> so he gave them a queer account of mr <\s>
<s> foker and how he used to be called vats and grains and by other contumelious names at school and how he was now exceedingly rich and a fellow commoner at st <\s>
<s> but gay and communicative as he was mr <\s>
<s> pen did not say one syllable about his ride to chatteris that day or about the new friends whom he had made there <\s>
<s> when the two ladies retired pen with flashing eyes filled up two great bumpers of madeira and looking smirke full in the face said here's to her <\s>
<s> here's to her said the curate with a sigh lifting the glass and emptying it so that his face was a little pink when he put it down <\s>
<s> pen had even less sleep that night than on the night before <\s>
<s> in the morning and almost before dawn he went out and saddled that unfortunate rebecca himself and rode her on the downs like mad <\s>
<s> again love had roused him and said awake pendennis i am here <\s>
<s> that charming fever that delicious longing and fire and uncertainty he hugged them to him he would not have lost them for all the world <\s>
<s> contains both love and war cicero and euripides did not occupy mr <\s>
<s> pen much for some time after this and honest mr <\s>
<s> smirke had a very easy time with his pupil <\s>
<s> rebecca was the animal who suffered most in the present state of pen's mind for besides those days when he could publicly announce his intention of going to chatteris to take a fencing lesson and went thither with the knowledge of his mother whenever he saw three hours clear before him the young rascal made a rush for the city and found his way to prior's lane <\s>
<s> he was as frantic with vexation when rebecca went lame as richard at bosworth when his horse was killed under him and got deeply into the books of the man who kept the hunting stables at chatteris for the doctoring of his own and the hire of another animal <\s>
<s> then and perhaps once in a week under pretence of going to read a greek play with smirke this young reprobate set off so as to be in time for the competitor down coach stayed a couple of hours in chatteris and returned on the rival which left for london at ten at night <\s>
<s> once his secret was nearly lost by smirke's simplicity of whom mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis asked whether they had read a great deal the night before or a question to that effect <\s>
<s> smirke was about to tell the truth that he had never seen mr <\s>
<s> pen at all when the latter's boot heel came grinding down on mr <\s>
<s> smirke's toe under the table and warned the curate not to betray him <\s>
<s> they had had conversations on the tender subject of course <\s>
<s> it is good sport if you are not yourself engaged in the conversation to hear two men in love talk <\s>
<s> there must be a confidant and depositary somewhere <\s>
<s> when informed under the most solemn vows of secrecy of pen's condition of mind the curate said with no small tremor that he hoped it was no unworthy object no unlawful attachment which pen had formed for if so the poor fellow felt it would be his duty to break his vow and inform pen's mother and then there would be a quarrel he felt with sickening apprehension and he would never again have a chance of seeing what he most liked in the world <\s>
<s> pen bounced out at the curate's question <\s>
<s> she is as pure as she is beautiful i would give my heart to no other woman <\s>
<s> i keep the matter a secret in my family because because there are reasons of a weighty nature which i am not at liberty to disclose <\s>
<s> but any man who breathes a word against her purity insults both her honour and mine and and dammy i won't stand it <\s>
<s> smirke with a faint laugh only said well well don't call me out arthur for you know i can't fight but by this compromise the wretched curate was put more than ever into the power of his pupil and the greek and mathematics suffered correspondingly <\s>
<s> if the reverend gentleman had had much discernment and looked into the poet's corner of the county chronicle as it arrived in the wednesday's bag he might have seen mrs <\s>
<s> haller passion and genius lines to miss fotheringay of the theatre royal appearing every week and other verses of the most gloomy thrilling and passionate cast <\s>
<s> but as these poems were no longer signed nep by their artful composer but subscribed eros neither the tutor nor helen the good soul who cut all her son's verses out of the paper knew that nep was no other than that flaming eros who sang so vehemently the character of the new actress <\s>
<s> who is the lady at last asked mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis whom your rival is always singing in the county chronicle <\s>
<s> he writes something like you dear pen but yours is much the best <\s>
<s> have you seen miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> pen said yes he had that night he went to see the stranger she acted mrs <\s>
<s> by the way she was going to have a benefit and was to appear in ophelia suppose we were to go shakspeare you know mother we can get horses from the clavering arms <\s>
<s> little laura sprang up with delight she longed for a play <\s>
<s> pen introduced shakspeare you know because the deceased pendennis as became a man of his character professed an uncommon respect for the bard of avon in whose works he safely said there was more poetry than in all johnson's poets put together <\s>
<s> pendennis did not much read the works in question yet he enjoined pen to peruse them and often said what pleasure he should have when the boy was of a proper age in taking him and mother to see some good plays of the immortal poet <\s>
<s> the ready tears welled up in the kind mother's eyes as she remembered these speeches of the man who was gone <\s>
<s> she kissed her son fondly and said she would go <\s>
<s> laura jumped for joy <\s>
<s> was pen happy was he ashamed <\s>
<s> as he held his mother to him he longed to tell her all but he kept his counsel <\s>
<s> he would see how his mother liked her the play should be the thing and he would try his mother like hamlet's <\s>
<s> helen in her good humour asked mr <\s>
<s> smirke to be of the party <\s>
<s> that ecclesiastic had been bred up by a fond parent at clapham who had an objection to dramatic entertainments and he had never yet seen a play <\s>
<s> but shakspeare but to go with mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis in her carriage and sit a whole night by her side he could not resist the idea of so much pleasure and made a feeble speech in which he spoke of temptation and gratitude and finally accepted mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis's most kind offer <\s>
<s> as he spoke he gave her a look which made her exceedingly uncomfortable <\s>
<s> she had seen that look more than once of late pursuing her <\s>
<s> he became more positively odious every day in the widow's eyes <\s>
<s> we are not going to say a great deal about pen's courtship of miss fotheringay for the reader has already had a specimen of her conversation much of which need surely not be reported <\s>
<s> pen sate with her hour after hour and poured forth all his honest boyish soul to her <\s>
<s> everything he knew or hoped or felt or had read or fancied he told to her <\s>
<s> he never tired of talking and longing <\s>
<s> one after another as his thoughts rose in his hot eager brain he clothed them in words and told them to her <\s>
<s> her part of the tete a tete was not to talk but to appear as if she understood what pen talked a difficult matter for the young fellow blurted out no small quantity of nonsense and to look exceedingly handsome and sympathising <\s>
<s> the fact is whilst he was making one of his tirades and delighted perhaps and wondering at his own eloquence the lad would go on for twenty minutes at a time the lovely emily who could not comprehend a tenth part of his talk had leisure to think about her own affairs and would arrange in her own mind how they should dress the cold mutton or how she would turn the black satin or make herself out of her scarf a bonnet like miss thackthwaite's new one and so forth <\s>
<s> pen spouted byron and moore passion and poetry her business was to throw up her eyes or fixing them for a moment on his face to cry oh tis beautiful <\s>
<s> repeat those lines again <\s>
<s> and off the boy went and she returned to her own simple thoughts about the turned gown or the hashed mutton <\s>
<s> in fact pen's passion was not long a secret from the lovely emily or her father <\s>
<s> upon his second visit his admiration was quite evident to both of them and on his departure the old gentleman said to his daughter as he winked at her over his glass of grog faith milly darling i think ye've hooked that chap <\s>
<s> pooh tis only a boy papa dear milly remarked <\s>
<s> sure he's but a child <\s>
<s> pen would have been very much pleased if he had heard that phrase he was galloping home wild with pleasure and shouting out her name as he rode <\s>
<s> ye've hooked um any how said the captain and let me tell ye he's not a bad fish <\s>
<s> i asked tom at the george and flint the grocer where his mother dales fine fortune drives in her chariot splendid park and grounds fairoaks park only son property all his own at twenty one ye might go further and not fare so well miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> them boys are mostly talk said milly seriously <\s>
<s> ye know at dublin how ye went on about young poldoody and i've a whole desk full of verses he wrote me when he was in trinity college but he went abroad and his mother married him to an englishwoman <\s>
<s> lord poldoody was a young nobleman and in them it's natural and ye weren't in the position in which ye are now milly dear <\s>
<s> but ye mustn't encourage this young chap too much for bedad jack costigan won't have any thrilling with his daughter <\s>
<s> no more will his daughter papa you may be sure of that milly said <\s>
<s> a little sip more of the punch sure tis beautiful <\s>
<s> ye needn't be afraid about the young chap i think i'm old enough to take care of myself captain costigan <\s>
<s> so pen used to come day after day rushing in and galloping away and growing more wild about the girl with every visit <\s>
<s> sometimes the captain was present at their meetings but having a perfect confidence in his daughter he was more often inclined to leave the young couple to themselves and cocked his hat over his eye and strutted off on some errand when pen entered <\s>
<s> how delightful those interviews were <\s>
<s> the captain's drawing room was a low wainscoted room with a large window looking into the dean's garden <\s>
<s> there pen sate and talked and talked emily looking beautiful as she sate at her work looking beautiful and calm and the sunshine came streaming in at the great windows and lighted up her superb face and form <\s>
<s> in the midst of the conversation the great bell would begin to boom and he would pause smiling and be silent until the sound of the vast music died away or the rooks in the cathedral elms would make a great noise towards sunset or the sound of the organ and the choristers would come over the quiet air and gently hush pen's talking <\s>
<s> by the way it must be said that miss fotheringay in a plain shawl and a close bonnet and veil went to church every sunday of her life accompanied by her indefatigable father who gave the responses in a very rich and fine brogue joined in the psalms and chanting and behaved in the most exemplary manner <\s>
<s> little bows the house friend of the family was exceedingly wroth at the notion of miss fotheringay's marriage with a stripling seven or eight years her junior <\s>
<s> bows who was a cripple and owned that he was a little more deformed even than bingley the manager so that he could not appear on the stage was a singular wild man of no small talents and humour <\s>
<s> attracted first by miss fotheringay's beauty he began to teach her how to act <\s>
<s> he shrieked out in his cracked voice the parts and his pupil learned them from his lips by rote and repeated them in her full rich tones <\s>
<s> he indicated the attitudes and set and moved those beautiful arms of hers <\s>
<s> those who remember this grand actress on the stage can recall how she used always precisely the same gestures looks and tones how she stood on the same plank of the stage in the same position rolled her eyes at the same instant and to the same degree and wept with precisely the same heart rending pathos and over the same pathetic syllable <\s>
<s> and after she had come out trembling with emotion before the audience and looking so exhausted and tearful that you fancied she would faint with sensibility she would gather up her hair the instant she was behind the curtain and go home to a mutton chop and a glass of brown stout and the harrowing labours of the day over she went to bed and snored as resolutely and as regularly as a porter <\s>
<s> bows then was indignant at the notion that his pupil should throw her chances away in life by bestowing her hand upon a little country squire <\s>
<s> as soon as a london manager saw her he prophesied that she would get a london engagement and a great success <\s>
<s> the misfortune was that the london managers had seen her <\s>
<s> she had played in london three years before and failed from utter stupidity <\s>
<s> since then it was that bows had taken her in hand and taught her part after part <\s>
<s> how he worked and screamed and twisted and repeated lines over and over again and with what indomitable patience and dulness she followed him <\s>
<s> she knew that he made her and let herself be made <\s>
<s> she was not grateful or ungrateful or unkind or ill humoured <\s>
<s> she was only stupid and pen was madly in love with her <\s>
<s> the post horses from the clavering arms arrived in due time and carried the party to the theatre at chatteris where pen was gratified in perceiving that a tolerably large audience was assembled <\s>
<s> the young gentlemen from baymouth had a box in the front of which sate mr <\s>
<s> foker and his friend mr <\s>
<s> spavin splendidly attired in the most full blown evening costume <\s>
<s> they saluted pen in a cordial manner and examined his party of which they approved for little laura was a pretty little red cheeked girl with a quantity of shining brown ringlets and mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis dressed in black velvet with the diamond cross which she sported on great occasions looked uncommonly handsome and majestic <\s>
<s> behind these sate mr <\s>
<s> arthur and the gentle smirke with the curl reposing on his fair forehead and his white tie in perfect order <\s>
<s> he blushed to find himself in such a place but how happy was he to be there <\s>
<s> pendennis brought books of hamlet with them to follow the tragedy as is the custom of honest countryfolks who go to a play in state <\s>
<s> samuel coachman groom and gardener to mr <\s>
<s> pendennis took his place in the pit where mr <\s>
<s> foker's man was also visible <\s>
<s> it was dotted with non commissioned officers of the dragoons whose band by kind permission of colonel swallowtail were as usual in the orchestra and that corpulent and distinguished warrior himself with his waterloo medal and a number of his young men made a handsome show in the boxes <\s>
<s> who is that odd looking person bowing to you arthur <\s>
<s> pendennis asked of her son <\s>
<s> pen blushed a great deal <\s>
<s> his name is captain costigan ma'am he said a peninsular officer <\s>
<s> in fact it was the captain in a new shoot of clothes as he called them and with a large pair of white kid gloves one of which he waved to pendennis whilst he laid the other sprawling over his heart and coat buttons <\s>
<s> pen did not say any more <\s>
<s> and how was mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis to know that mr <\s>
<s> costigan was the father of miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> hornbull from london was the hamlet of the night mr <\s>
<s> bingley modestly contenting himself with the part of horatio and reserving his chief strength for william in black eyed susan which was the second piece <\s>
<s> we have nothing to do with the play except to say that ophelia looked lovely and performed with admirable wild pathos laughing weeping gazing wildly waving her beautiful white arms and flinging about her snatches of flowers and songs with the most charming madness <\s>
<s> what an opportunity her splendid black hair had of tossing over her shoulders <\s>
<s> she made the most charming corpse ever seen and while hamlet and laertes were battling in her grave she was looking out from the back scenes with some curiosity towards pen's box and the family party assembled in it <\s>
<s> there was but one voice in her praise there <\s>
<s> pendennis was in ecstasies with her beauty <\s>
<s> little laura was bewildered by the piece and the ghost and the play within the play during which as hamlet lay at ophelia's knee pen felt that he would have liked to strangle mr <\s>
<s> hornbull but cried out great praises of that beautiful young creature <\s>
<s> pen was charmed with the effect which she produced on his mother and the clergyman for his part was exceedingly enthusiastic <\s>
<s> when the curtain fell upon that group of slaughtered personages who are despatched so suddenly at the end of hamlet and whose demise astonished poor little laura not a little there was an immense shouting and applause from all quarters of the house the intrepid smirke violently excited clapped his hands and cried out bravo bravo as loud as the dragoon officers themselves <\s>
<s> these were greatly moved ils s'agitaient sur leurs bancs to borrow a phrase from our neighbours <\s>
<s> they were led cheering into action by the portly swallowtail who waved his cap the non commissioned officers in the pit of course gallantly following their chiefs <\s>
<s> there was a roar of bravos rang through the house pen bellowing with the loudest fotheringay <\s>
<s> spavin and foker giving the view halloo from their box <\s>
<s> pendennis began to wave about her pocket handkerchief and little laura danced laughed clapped and looked up at pen with wonder <\s>
<s> hornbull led the beneficiaire forward amidst bursts of enthusiasm and she looked so handsome and radiant with her hair still over her shoulders that pen hardly could contain himself for rapture and he leaned over his mother's chair and shouted and hurrayed and waved his hat <\s>
<s> it was all he could do to keep his secret from helen and not say look <\s>
<s> i tell you i love her <\s>
<s> but he disguised these feelings under an enormous bellowing and hurraying <\s>
<s> as for miss fotheringay and her behaviour the reader is referred to a former page for an account of that <\s>

<s> you saw how beautiful she was he said to his mother with a soothing protecting air like hamlet with gertrude in the play <\s>

<s> send for the major <\s>
<s> with all my heart said arthur prince of pendennis and grand duke of fairoaks with a most superb wave of the hand <\s>
<s> and the colloquy terminated by the writing of those two letters which were laid on major pendennis's breakfast table in london at the commencement of prince arthur's most veracious history <\s>
<s> in which the major makes his appearance our acquaintance major arthur pendennis arrived in due time at fairoaks after a dreary night passed in the mail coach where a stout fellow passenger swelling preternaturally with great coats had crowded him into a corner and kept him awake by snoring indecently where a widow lady opposite had not only shut out the fresh air by closing all the windows of the vehicle but had filled the interior with fumes of jamaica rum and water which she sucked perpetually from a bottle in her reticule where whenever he caught a brief moment of sleep the twanging of the horn at the turnpike gates or the scuffling of his huge neighbour wedging him closer and closer or the play of the widow's feet on his own tender toes speedily woke up the poor gentleman to the horrors and realities of life a life which has passed away now and become impossible and only lives in fond memories <\s>
<s> eight miles an hour for twenty or five and twenty hours a tight mail coach a hard seat a gouty tendency a perpetual change of coachmen grumbling because you did not fee them enough a fellow passenger partial to spirits and water who has not borne with these evils in the jolly old times <\s>
<s> and how could people travel under such difficulties <\s>
<s> and yet they did and were merry too <\s>
<s> next the widow and by the side of the major's servant on the roof were a couple of school boys going home for the midsummer holidays and major pendennis wondered to see them sup at the inn at bagshot where they took in a cargo of ham eggs pie pickles tea coffee and boiled beef which surprised the poor major sipping a cup of very feeble tea and thinking with a tender dejection that lord steyne's dinner was coming off at that very moment <\s>
<s> the ingenuous ardour of the boys however amused the major who was very good natured and he became the more interested when he found that the one who travelled inside with him was a lord's son whose noble father pendennis of course had met in the world of fashion which he frequented <\s>
<s> the little lord slept all night through in spite of the squeezing and the horn blowing and the widow and he looked as fresh as paint and indeed pronounced himself to be so when the major with a yellow face a bristly beard a wig out of curl and strong rheumatic griefs shooting through various limbs of his uneasy body descended at the little lodge gate at fairoaks where the porteress and gardener's wife reverentially greeted him and still more respectfully mr <\s>
<s> helen was on the look out for this expected guest and saw him from her window <\s>
<s> but she did not come forward immediately to greet him <\s>
<s> she knew the major did not like to be seen at a surprise and required a little preparation before he cared to be visible <\s>
<s> pen when a boy had incurred sad disgrace by carrying off from the major's dressing table a little morocco box which it must be confessed contained the major's back teeth which he naturally would leave out of his jaws in a jolting mail coach and without which he would not choose to appear <\s>
<s> morgan his man made a mystery of mystery of his wigs curling them in private places introducing them mysteriously to his master's room nor without his head of hair would the major care to show himself to any member of his family or any acquaintance <\s>
<s> he went to his apartment then and supplied these deficiencies he groaned and moaned and wheezed and cursed morgan through his toilet as an old buck will who has been up all night with a rheumatism and has a long duty to perform <\s>
<s> and finally being belted curled and set straight he descended upon the drawing room with a grave majestic air such as befitted one who was at once a man of business and a man of fashion <\s>
<s> pen was not there however only helen and little laura sewing at her knees and to whom he never presented more than a forefinger as he did on this occasion after saluting his sister in law <\s>
<s> laura took the finger trembling and dropped it and then fled out of the room <\s>
<s> major pendennis did not want to keep her or indeed to have her in the house at all and had his private reason for disapproving of her which we may mention on some future occasion <\s>
<s> meanwhile laura disappeared and wandered about the premises seeking for pen whom she presently found in the orchard pacing up and down a walk there in earnest conversation with mr <\s>
<s> he was so occupied that he did not hear laura's clear voice singing out until smirke pulled him by the coat and pointed towards her as she came running <\s>
<s> she ran up and put her hand into his <\s>
<s> come in pen she said there's somebody come uncle arthur's come <\s>
<s> he is is he <\s>
<s> said pen and she felt him grasp her little hand <\s>
<s> he looked round at smirke with uncommon fierceness as much as to say i am ready for him or any man mr <\s>
<s> smirke cast up his eyes as usual and heaved a gentle sigh <\s>
<s> lead on laura pen said with a half fierce half comic air lead on and say i wait upon my uncle <\s>
<s> but he was laughing in order to hide a great anxiety and was screwing his courage inwardly to face the ordeal which he knew was now before him <\s>
<s> pen had taken smirke into his confidence in the last two days and after the outbreak attendant on the discovery of doctor portman and during every one of those forty eight hours which he had passed in mr <\s>
<s> smirke's society had done nothing but talk to his tutor about miss fotheringay miss emily fotheringay emily etc to all which talk smirke listened without difficulty for he was in love himself most anxious in all things to propitiate pen and indeed very much himself enraptured by the personal charms of this goddess whose like never having been before at a theatrical representation he had not beheld until now <\s>
<s> pen's fire and volubility his hot eloquence and rich poetical tropes and figures his manly heart kind ardent and hopeful refusing to see any defects in the person he loved any difficulties in their position that he might not overcome had half convinced mr <\s>
<s> smirke that the arrangement proposed by mr <\s>
<s> pen was a very feasible and prudent one and that it would be a great comfort to have emily settled at fairoaks captain costigan in the yellow room established for life there and pen married at eighteen <\s>
<s> and it is a fact that in these two days the boy had almost talked over his mother too had parried all her objections one after another with that indignant good sense which is often the perfection of absurdity and had brought her almost to acquiesce in the belief that if the marriage was doomed in heaven why doomed it was that if the young woman was a good person it was all that she for her part had to ask and rather to dread the arrival of the guardian uncle who she foresaw would regard mr <\s>
<s> pen's marriage in a manner very different to that simple romantic honest and utterly absurd way in which the widow was already disposed to look at questions of this sort <\s>
<s> for as in the old allegory of the gold and silver shield about which the two knights quarrelled each is right according to the point from which he looks so about marriage the question whether it is foolish or good wise or otherwise depends upon the point of view from which you regard it <\s>
<s> if it means a snug house in belgravia and pretty little dinner parties and a pretty little brougham to drive in the park and a decent provision not only for the young people but for the little belgravians to come and if these are the necessaries of life and they are with many honest people to talk of any other arrangement is an absurdity of love in lodgings a babyish folly of affection that can't pay coach hire or afford a decent milliner as mere wicked balderdash and childish romance <\s>
<s> if on the other hand your opinion is that people not with an assured subsistence but with a fair chance to obtain it and with the stimulus of hope health and strong affection may take the chance of fortune for better or worse and share its good or its evil together the polite theory then becomes an absurdity in its turn worse than an absurdity a blasphemy almost and doubt of providence and a man who waits to make his chosen woman happy until he can drive her to church in a neat little carriage with a pair of horses is no better than a coward or a trifler who is neither worthy of love nor of fortune <\s>
<s> i don't say that the town folks are not right but helen pendennis was a country bred woman and the book of life as she interpreted it told her a different story to that page which is read in cities <\s>
<s> like most soft and sentimental women matchmaking in general formed a great part of her thoughts and i daresay she had begun to speculate about her son's falling in love and marrying long before the subject had ever entered into the brains of the young gentleman <\s>
<s> it pleased her with that dismal pleasure which the idea of sacrificing themselves gives to certain women to think of the day when she would give up all to pen and he should bring his wife home and she would surrender the keys and the best bedroom and go and sit at the side of the table and see him happy <\s>
<s> what did she want in life but to see the lad prosper <\s>
<s> as an empress certainly was not too good for him and would be honoured by becoming mrs <\s>
<s> pen so if he selected humble esther instead of queen vashti she would be content with his lordship's choice <\s>
<s> never mind how lowly or poor the person might be who was to enjoy that prodigious honour mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis was willing to bow before her and welcome her and yield her up the first place <\s>
<s> but an actress a mature woman who had long ceased blushing except with rouge as she stood under the eager glances of thousands of eyes an illiterate and ill bred person very likely who must have lived with light associates and have heard doubtful conversation oh <\s>
<s> it was hard that such a one should be chosen and that the matron should be deposed to give place to such a sultana <\s>
<s> all these doubts the widow laid before pen during the two days which had of necessity to elapse ere the uncle came down but he met them with that happy frankness and ease which a young gentleman exhibits at his time of life and routed his mother's objections with infinite satisfaction to himself <\s>
<s> miss costigan was a paragon of virtue and delicacy she was as sensitive as the most timid maiden she was as pure as the unsullied snow she had the finest manners the most graceful wit and genius the most charming refinement and justness of appreciation in all matters of taste she had the most admirable temper and devotion to her father a good old gentleman of high family and fallen fortunes who had lived however with the best society in europe he was in no hurry and could afford to wait any time till he was one and twenty <\s>
<s> but he felt and here his face assumed an awful and harrowing solemnity that he was engaged in the one only passion of his life and that death alone could close it <\s>
<s> helen told him with a sad smile and shake of the head that people survived these passions and as for long engagements contracted between very young men and old women she knew an instance in her own family laura's poor father was an instance how fatal they were <\s>
<s> pen however was resolved that death must be his doom in case of disappointment and rather than this rather than baulk him in fact this lady would have submitted to any sacrifice or personal pain and would have gone down on her knees and have kissed the feet of a hottentot daughter in law <\s>
<s> arthur knew his power over the widow and the young tyrant was touched whilst he exercised it <\s>
<s> in those two days he brought her almost into submission and patronised her very kindly and he passed one evening with the lovely pie maker at chatteris in which he bragged of his influence over his mother and he spent the other night in composing a most flaming and conceited copy of verses to his divinity in which he vowed like montrose that he would make her famous with his sword and glorious by his pen and that he would love her as no mortal woman had been adored since the creation of womankind <\s>
<s> it was on that night long after midnight that wakeful helen passing stealthily by her son's door saw a light streaming through the chink of the door into the dark passage and heard pen tossing and tumbling and mumbling verses in his bed <\s>
<s> she waited outside for a while anxiously listening to him <\s>
<s> in infantile fevers and early boyish illnesses many a night before the kind soul had so kept watch <\s>
<s> she turned the lock very softly now and went in so gently that pen for a moment did not see her <\s>
<s> his face was turned from her <\s>
<s> his papers on his desk were scattered about and more were lying on the bed round him <\s>
<s> he was biting a pencil and thinking of rhymes and all sorts of follies and passions <\s>
<s> he was hamlet jumping into ophelia's grave he was the stranger taking mrs <\s>
<s> haller to his arms beautiful mrs <\s>
<s> haller with the raven ringlets falling over her shoulders <\s>
<s> despair and byron thomas moore and all the loves of the angels waller and herrick beranger and all the love songs he had ever read were working and seething in this young gentleman's mind and he was at the very height and paroxysm of the imaginative frenzy when his mother found him <\s>
<s> arthur said the mother's soft silver voice and he started up and turned round <\s>
<s> he clutched some of the papers and pushed them under the pillow <\s>
<s> why don't you go to sleep my dear <\s>
<s> she said with a sweet tender smile and sate down on the bed and took one of his hot hands <\s>
<s> pen looked at her wildly for an instant i couldn't sleep he said i i was i was writing and hereupon he flung his arms round her neck and said o mother <\s>
<s> i love her i love her how could such a kind soul as that help soothing and pitying him <\s>
<s> the gentle creature did her best and thought with a strange wonderment and tenderness that it was only yesterday that he was a child in that bed and how she used to come and say her prayers over it before he woke upon holiday mornings <\s>
<s> they were very grand verses no doubt although miss fotheringay did not understand them but old cos with a wink and a knowing finger on his nose said put them up with th other letthers milly darling <\s>
<s> poldoody's pomes was nothing to this <\s>
<s> so milly locked up the manuscripts <\s>
<s> when then the major being dressed and presentable presented himself to mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis he found in the course of ten minutes colloquy that the poor widow was not merely distressed at the idea of the marriage contemplated by pen but actually more distressed at thinking that the boy himself was unhappy about it and that his uncle and he should have any violent altercation on the subject <\s>
<s> she besought major pendennis to be very gentle with arthur he has a very high spirit and will not brook unkind words she hinted <\s>
<s> portman spoke to him rather roughly and i must own unjustly the other night for my dearest boy's honour is as high as any mother can desire but pen's answer quite frightened me it was so indignant <\s>
<s> recollect he is a man now and be very very cautious said the widow laying a fair long hand on the major's sleeve <\s>
<s> he took it up kissed it gallantly and looked in her alarmed face with wonder and a scorn which he was too polite to show <\s>
<s> thought the old negotiator the boy has actually talked the woman round and she'd get him a wife as she would a toy if master cried for it <\s>
<s> why are there no such things as lettres de cachet and a bastille for young fellows of family <\s>
<s> the major lived in such good company that he might be excused for feeling like an earl he kissed the widow's timid hand pressed it in both his and laid it down on the table with one of his own over it as he smiled and looked her in the face <\s>
<s> confess said he now that you are thinking how you possibly can make it up to your conscience to let the boy have his own way <\s>
<s> she blushed and was moved in the usual manner of females <\s>
<s> i am thinking that he is very unhappy and i am too to contradict him or to let him have his own wish <\s>
<s> asked the other and added with great comfort to his inward self i'm d  d if he shall <\s>
<s> to think that he should have formed so foolish and cruel and fatal an attachment the widow said which can but end in pain whatever be the issue <\s>
<s> the issue shan't be marriage my dear sister the major said resolutely <\s>
<s> we're not going to have a pendennis the head of the house marry a strolling mountebank from a booth <\s>
<s> no no we won't marry into greenwich fair ma'am <\s>
<s> if the match is broken suddenly off the widow interposed i don't know what may be the consequence <\s>
<s> i know arthur's ardent temper the intensity of his affections the agony of his pleasures and disappointments and i tremble at this one if it must be <\s>
<s> indeed indeed it must not come on him too suddenly <\s>
<s> my dear madam the major said with an air of the deepest commiseration i've no doubt arthur will have to suffer confoundedly before he gets over the little disappointment <\s>
<s> but is he think you the only person who has been so rendered miserable <\s>
<s> no indeed said helen holding down her eyes <\s>
<s> she was thinking of her own case and was at that moment seventeen again and most miserable <\s>
<s> i myself whispered her brother in law have undergone a disappointment in early life <\s>
<s> a young woman with fifteen thousand pounds niece to an earl most accomplished creature a third of her money would have run up my promotion in no time and i should have been a lieutenant colonel at thirty but it might not be <\s>
<s> i was but a penniless lieutenant her parents interfered and i embarked for india where i had the honour of being secretary to lord buckley when commander in chief without her <\s>
<s> we returned our letters sent back our locks of hair the major here passed his fingers through his wig we suffered but we recovered <\s>
<s> she is now a baronet's wife with thirteen grown up children altered it is true in person but her daughters remind me of what she was and the third is to be presented early next week <\s>
<s> helen did not answer <\s>
<s> she was still thinking of old times <\s>
<s> i suppose if one lives to be a hundred there are certain passages of one's early life whereof the recollection will always carry us back to youth again and that helen was thinking of one of these <\s>
<s> look at my own brother my dear creature the major continued gallantly he himself you know had a little disappointment when he started in the the medical profession an eligible opportunity presented itself <\s>
<s> miss balls i remember the name was daughter of an apoth a practitioner in very large practice my brother had very nearly succeeded in his suit but difficulties arose disappointments supervened and and i am sure he had no reason to regret the disappointment which gave him this hand said the major and he once more politely pressed helen's fingers <\s>
<s> those marriages between people of such different rank and age said helen are sad things <\s>
<s> i have known them produce a great deal of unhappiness laura's father my cousin who who was brought up with me she added in a low voice was an instance of that <\s>
<s> most injudicious cut in the major <\s>
<s> i don't know anything more painful than for a man to marry his superior in age or his inferior in station <\s>
<s> fancy marrying a woman of low rank of life and having your house filled with her confounded tag rag and bobtail of relations <\s>
<s> fancy your wife attached to a mother who dropped her h's or called maria marire <\s>
<s> how are you to introduce her into society <\s>
<s> pendennis i will name no names but in the very best circles of london society i have seen men suffering the most excruciating agony i have known them to be cut to be lost utterly from the vulgarity of their wives connections <\s>
<s> what did lady snapperton do last year at her dejeune dansant after the bohemian ball <\s>
<s> she told lord brouncker that he might bring his daughters or send them with a proper chaperon but that she would not receive lady brouncker who was a druggist's daughter or some such thing and as tom wagg remarked of her never wanted medicine certainly for she never had an h in her life <\s>
<s> good ged what would have been the trifling pang of a separation in the first instance to the enduring infliction of a constant misalliance and intercourse with low people <\s>
<s> said helen dimly disposed towards laughter but yet checking the inclination because she remembered in what prodigious respect her deceased husband held major pendennis and his stories of the great world <\s>
<s> then this fatal woman is ten years older than that silly young scapegrace of an arthur <\s>
<s> what happens in such cases my dear creature <\s>
<s> i don't mind telling you now we are alone that in the highest state of society misery undeviating misery is the result <\s>
<s> look at lord clodworthy come into a room with his wife why good ged she looks like clodworthy's mother <\s>
<s> what's the case between lord and lady willowbank whose love match was notorious <\s>
<s> he has already cut her down twice when she has hanged herself out of jealousy for mademoiselle de sainte cunegonde the dancer and mark my words good ged one day he'll not cut the old woman down <\s>
<s> no my dear madam you are not in the world but i am you are a little romantic and sentimental you know you are women with those large beautiful eyes always are ); you must leave this matter to my experience <\s>
<s> marry at eighteen an actress of thirty bah bah i would as soon he sent into the kitchen and married the cook <\s>
<s> i know the evils of premature engagements sighed out helen and as she has made this allusion no less than thrice in the course of the above conversation and seems to be so oppressed with the notion of long engagements and unequal marriages and as the circumstance we have to relate will explain what perhaps some persons are anxious to know namely who little laura is who has appeared more than once before us it will be as well to clear up these points in another chapter <\s>
<s> in which pen is kept waiting at the door while the reader is informed who little laura was <\s>
<s> once upon a time then there was a young gentleman of cambridge university who came to pass the long vacation at the village where young helen thistlewood was living with her mother the widow of the lieutenant slain at copenhagen <\s>
<s> this gentleman whose name was the reverend francis bell was nephew to mrs <\s>
<s> thistlewood and by consequence own cousin to miss helen so that it was very right that he should take lodgings in his aunt's house who lived in a very small way and there he passed the long vacation reading with three or four pupils who accompanied him to the village <\s>

<s> on his knees before those peas and her he pledged himself to an endless affection <\s>
<s> miss coacher was by many years the young fellow's senior and her own heart had been lacerated by many previous disappointments in the matrimonial line <\s>
<s> no less than three pupils of her father had trifled with those young affections <\s>
<s> the apothecary of the village had despicably jilted her <\s>
<s> the dragoon officer with whom she had danced so many many times during that happy season which she passed at bath with her gouty grandmamma one day gaily shook his bridle rein and galloped away never to return <\s>
<s> wounded by the shafts of repeated ingratitude can it be wondered at that the heart of martha coacher should pant to find rest somewhere <\s>
<s> she listened to the proposals of the gawky gallant honest boy with great kindness and good humour at the end of his speech she said law bell i'm sure you are too young to think of such things but intimated that she too would revolve them in her own virgin bosom <\s>
<s> she could not refer mr <\s>
<s> bell to her mamma for mr <\s>
<s> coacher was a widower and being immersed in his books was of course unable to take the direction of so frail and wondrous an article as a lady's heart which miss martha had to manage for herself <\s>
<s> a lock of her hair tied up in a piece of blue ribbon conveyed to the happy bell the result of the vestal's conference with herself <\s>
<s> thrice before had she snipt off one of her auburn ringlets and given them away <\s>
<s> the possessors were faithless but the hair had grown again and martha had indeed occasion to say that men were deceivers when she handed over this token of love to the simple boy <\s>
<s> number 6 however was an exception to former passions francis bell was the most faithful of lovers <\s>
<s> when his time arrived to go to college and it became necessary to acquaint mr <\s>
<s> coacher of the arrangements that had been made the latter cried god bless my soul i hadn't the least idea what was going on as was indeed very likely for he had been taken in three times before in precisely a similar manner and francis went to the university resolved to conquer honours so as to be able to lay them at the feet of his beloved martha <\s>
<s> this prize in view made him labour prodigiously <\s>
<s> news came term after term of the honours he won <\s>
<s> he sent the prize books for his college essays to old coacher and his silver declamation cup to miss martha <\s>
<s> in due season he was high among the wranglers and a fellow of his college and during all the time of these transactions a constant tender correspondence was kept up with miss coacher to whose influence and perhaps with justice he attributed the successes which he had won <\s>
<s> by the time however when the rev <\s>
<s> francis bell m a and fellow and tutor of his college was twenty six years of age it happened that miss coacher was thirty four nor had her charms her manners or her temper improved since that sunny day in the springtime of life when he found her picking peas in the garden <\s>
<s> having achieved his honours he relaxed in the ardour of his studies and his judgment and tastes also perhaps became cooler <\s>
<s> the sunshine of the pea garden faded away from miss martha and poor bell found himself engaged and his hand pledged to that bond in a thousand letters to a coarse ill tempered ill favoured ill mannered middle aged woman <\s>
<s> it was in consequence of one of many altercations in which martha's eloquence shone and in which therefore she was frequently pleased to indulge that francis refused to take his pupils to bearleader's green where mr <\s>
<s> coacher's living was and where bell was in the habit of spending the summer and he bethought him that he would pass the vacation at his aunt's village which he had not seen for many years not since little helen was a girl and used to sit on his knee <\s>
<s> down then he came and lived with them <\s>
<s> helen was grown a beautiful young woman now <\s>
<s> the cousins were nearly four months together from june to october <\s>
<s> they walked in the summer evenings they met in the early morn <\s>
<s> they read out of the same book when the old lady dozed at night over the candles <\s>
<s> what little helen knew frank taught her <\s>
<s> she sang to him she gave her artless heart to him <\s>
<s> she was aware of all his story <\s>
<s> had he made any secret had he not shown the picture of the woman to whom he was engaged and with a blush her letters hard eager and cruel the days went on and on happier and closer with more kindness more confidence and more pity <\s>
<s> at last one morning in october came when francis went back to college and the poor girl felt that her tender heart was gone with him <\s>
<s> frank too wakened up from the delightful midsummer dream to the horrible reality of his own pain <\s>
<s> he gnashed and tore at the chain which bound him <\s>
<s> he was frantic to break it and be free <\s>
<s> should he confess give his savings to the woman to whom he was bound and beg his release there was time yet he temporised <\s>
<s> no living might fall in for years to come <\s>
<s> the cousins went on corresponding sadly and fondly the betrothed woman hard jealous and dissatisfied complaining bitterly and with reason of her francis's altered tone <\s>
<s> at last things came to a crisis and the new attachment was discovered <\s>
<s> francis owned it cared not to disguise it rebuked martha with her violent temper and angry imperiousness and worst of all with her inferiority and her age <\s>
<s> her reply was that if he did not keep his promise she would carry his letters into every court in the kingdom letters in which his love was pledged to her ten thousand times and after exposing him to the world as the perjurer and traitor he was she would kill herself <\s>
<s> frank had one more interview with helen whose mother was dead then and who was living companion with old lady pontypool one more interview where it was resolved that he was to do his duty that is to redeem his vow that is to pay a debt cozened from him by a sharper that is to make two honest people miserable <\s>
<s> so the two judged their duty to be and they parted <\s>
<s> the living fell in only too soon but yet frank bell was quite a grey and worn out man when he was inducted into it <\s>
<s> helen wrote him a letter on his marriage beginning my dear cousin and ending always truly yours <\s>
<s> she sent him back the other letters and the lock of his hair all but a small piece <\s>
<s> she had it in her desk when she was talking to the major <\s>
<s> bell lived for three or four years in his living at the end of which time the chaplainship of coventry island falling vacant frank applied for it privately and having procured it announced the appointment to his wife <\s>
<s> she objected as she did to everything <\s>
<s> he told her bitterly that he did not want her to come so she went <\s>
<s> bell went out in governor crawley's time and was very intimate with that gentleman in his later years <\s>
<s> and it was in coventry island years after his own marriage and five years after he had heard of the birth of helen's boy that his own daughter was born <\s>
<s> she was not the daughter of the first mrs <\s>
<s> bell who died of island fever very soon after helen pendennis and her husband to whom helen had told everything wrote to inform bell of the birth of their child <\s>
<s> i was old was i <\s>

<s> but i married you mr <\s>
<s> bell and kept you from marrying her <\s>
<s> and hereupon she died <\s>
<s> bell married a colonial lady whom he loved fondly <\s>
<s> but he was not doomed to prosper in love and this lady dying in childbirth bell gave up too sending his little girl home to helen pendennis and her husband with a parting prayer that they would befriend her <\s>
<s> the little thing came to fairoaks from bristol which is not very far off dressed in black and in company of a soldier's wife her nurse at parting from whom she wept bitterly <\s>
<s> but she soon dried up her grief under helen's motherly care <\s>
<s> round her neck she had a locket with hair which helen had given ah how many years ago <\s>
<s> to poor francis dead and buried <\s>
<s> this child was all that was left of him and she cherished as so tender a creature would the legacy which he had bequeathed to her <\s>
<s> the girl's name as his dying letter stated was helen laura <\s>
<s> but john pendennis though he accepted the trust was always rather jealous of the orphan and gloomily ordered that she should be called by her own mother's name and not by that first one which her father had given her <\s>
<s> she was afraid of mr <\s>
<s> pendennis to the last moment of his life <\s>
<s> and it was only when her husband was gone that helen dared openly to indulge in the tenderness which she felt for the little girl <\s>
<s> thus it was that laura bell became mrs <\s>
<s> neither her husband nor that gentleman's brother the major viewed her with very favourable eyes <\s>
<s> she reminded the first of circumstances in his wife's life which he was forced to accept but would have forgotten much more willingly and as for the second how could he regard her <\s>
<s> she was neither related to his own family of pendennis nor to any nobleman in this empire and she had but a couple of thousand pounds for her fortune <\s>
<s> and now let mr <\s>
<s> pen come in who has been waiting all this while <\s>
<s> having strung up his nerves and prepared himself without at the door for the meeting he came to it determined to face the awful uncle <\s>
<s> he had settled in his mind that the encounter was to be a fierce one and was resolved on bearing it through with all the courage and dignity of the famous family which he represented <\s>
<s> and he flung open the door and entered with the most severe and warlike expression armed cap a pie as it were with lance couched and plumes displayed and glancing at his adversary as if to say come on i'm ready <\s>
<s> the old man of the world as he surveyed the boy's demeanour could hardly help a grin at his admirable pompous simplicity <\s>
<s> major pendennis too had examined his ground and finding that the widow was already half won over to the enemy and having a shrewd notion that threats and tragic exhortations would have no effect upon the boy who was inclined to be perfectly stubborn and awfully serious the major laid aside the authoritative manner at once and with the most good humoured natural smile in the world held out his hands to pen shook the lad's passive fingers gaily and said well pen my boy tell us all about it <\s>
<s> helen was delighted with the generosity of the major's good humour <\s>
<s> on the contrary it quite took aback and disappointed poor pen whose nerves were strung up for a tragedy and who felt that his grand entree was altogether baulked and ludicrous <\s>
<s> he blushed and winced with mortified vanity and bewilderment <\s>
<s> he felt immensely inclined to begin to cry i i i didn't know that you were come till just now he said is is town very full i suppose <\s>
<s> if pen could hardly gulp his tears down it was all the major could do to keep from laughter <\s>
<s> he turned round and shot a comical glance at mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis who too felt that the scene was at once ridiculous and sentimental <\s>
<s> and so having nothing to say she went up and kissed mr <\s>
<s> pen as he thought of her tenderness and soft obedience to his wishes it is very possible too the boy was melted <\s>
<s> what a couple of fools they are thought the old guardian <\s>
<s> if i hadn't come down she would have driven over in state to pay a visit and give her blessing to the young lady's family <\s>
<s> come come said he still grinning at the couple let us have as little sentiment as possible and pen my good fellow tell us the whole story <\s>
<s> pen got back at once to his tragic and heroical air <\s>
<s> the story is sir said he as i have written it to you before <\s>
<s> i have made the acquaintance of a most beautiful and most virtuous lady of a high family although in reduced circumstances i have found the woman in whom i know that the happiness of my life is centred i feel that i never never can think about any woman but her <\s>
<s> i am aware of the difference of our ages and other difficulties in my way <\s>
<s> but my affection was so great that i felt i could surmount all these that we both could and she has consented to unite her lot with mine and to accept my heart and my fortune <\s>
<s> how much is that my boy <\s>
<s> has anybody left you some money <\s>
<s> i don't know that you are worth a shilling in the world <\s>
<s> you know what i have is his cried out mrs <\s>
<s> good heavens madam hold your tongue <\s>
<s> was what the guardian was disposed to say but he kept his temper not without a struggle <\s>
<s> no doubt no doubt he said <\s>
<s> you would sacrifice anything for him <\s>
<s> but it is after all then your fortune which pen is offering to the young lady and of which he wishes to take possession at eighteen <\s>
<s> i know my mother will give me anything pen said looking rather disturbed <\s>
<s> yes my good fellow but there is reason in all things <\s>
<s> if your mother keeps the house it is but fair that she should select her company <\s>
<s> when you give her house over her head and transfer her banker's account to yourself for the benefit of miss what d' you call 'em miss costigan don't you think you should at least have consulted my sister as one of the principal parties in the transaction <\s>
<s> i am speaking to you you see without the least anger or assumption of authority such as the law and your father's will give me over you for three years to come but as one man of the world to another and i ask you if you think that because you can do what you like with your mother therefore you have a right to do so <\s>
<s> as you are her dependent would it not have been more generous to wait before you took this step and at least to have paid her the courtesy to ask her leave <\s>
<s> pen held down his head and began dimly to perceive that the action on which he had prided himself as a most romantic generous instance of disinterested affection was perhaps a very selfish and headstrong piece of folly <\s>
<s> i did it in a moment of passion said pen floundering i was not aware what i was going to say or to do and in this he spoke with perfect sincerity but now it is said and i stand to it <\s>
<s> no i neither can nor will recall it <\s>
<s> i'll die rather than do so <\s>
<s> and i i don't want to burthen my mother he continued <\s>
<s> i'll work for myself <\s>
<s> i'll go on the stage and act with her <\s>
<s> she she says i should do well there <\s>
<s> but will she take you on those terms <\s>
<s> mind i do not say that miss costigan is not the most disinterested of women but don't you suppose now fairly that your position as a young gentleman of ancient birth and decent expectations forms a part of the cause why she finds your addresses welcome <\s>
<s> i'll die i say rather than forfeit my pledge to her said pen doubling his fists and turning red <\s>
<s> who asks you my dear friend <\s>
<s> answered the imperturbable guardian <\s>
<s> no gentleman breaks his word of course when it has been given freely <\s>
<s> but after all you can wait <\s>
<s> you owe something to your mother something to your family something to me as your father's representative <\s>
<s> oh of course pen said feeling rather relieved <\s>
<s> well as you have pledged your word to her give us another will you arthur <\s>
<s> that you will make no private marriage that you won't be taking a trip to scotland you understand <\s>
<s> that would be a falsehood <\s>
<s> pen never told his mother a falsehood helen said <\s>
<s> pen hung down his head again and his eyes filled with tears of shame <\s>
<s> had not this whole intrigue been a falsehood to that tender and confiding creature who was ready to give up all for his sake <\s>
<s> he gave his uncle his hand <\s>
<s> no sir on my word of honour as a gentleman he said i will never marry without my mother's consent <\s>
<s> and giving helen a bright parting look of confidence and affection unchangeable the boy went out of the drawing room into his own study <\s>
<s> he's an angel he's an angel the mother cried out in one of her usual raptures <\s>
<s> he comes of a good stock ma'am said her brother in law of a good stock on both sides <\s>
<s> the major was greatly pleased with the result of his diplomacy so much so that he once more saluted the tips of mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis's glove and dropping the curt manly and straightforward tone in which he had conducted the conversation with the lad assumed a certain drawl which he always adopted when he was most conceited and fine <\s>
<s> my dear creature said he in that his politest tone i think it certainly as well that i came down and i flatter myself that last botte was a successful one <\s>
<s> i tell you how i came to think of it <\s>
<s> three years ago my kind friend lady ferrybridge sent for me in the greatest state of alarm about her son gretna whose affair you remember and implored me to use my influence with the young gentleman who was engaged in an affaire de coeur with a scotch clergyman's daughter miss mactoddy <\s>
<s> i implored i entreated gentle measures <\s>
<s> but lord ferrybridge was furious and tried the high hand <\s>
<s> gretna was sulky and silent and his parents thought they had conquered <\s>
<s> but what was the fact my dear creature <\s>
<s> the young people had been married for three months before lord ferrybridge knew anything about it <\s>
<s> and that was why i extracted the promise from master pen <\s>
<s> arthur would never have done so mrs <\s>
<s> he hasn't that is one comfort answered the brother in law <\s>
<s> like a wary and patient man of the world major pendennis did not press poor pen any farther for the moment but hoped the best from time and that the young fellow's eyes would be opened before long to see the absurdity of which he was guilty <\s>
<s> and having found out how keen the boy's point of honour was he worked kindly upon that kindly feeling with great skill discoursing him over their wine after dinner and pointing out to pen the necessity of a perfect uprightness and openness in all his dealings and entreating that his communications with his interesting young friend as the major politely called miss fotheringay should be carried on with the knowledge if not approbation of mrs <\s>
<s> after all pen the major said with a convenient frankness that did not displease the boy whilst it advanced the interests of the negotiator you must bear in mind that you are throwing yourself away <\s>
<s> your mother may submit to your marriage as she would to anything else you desired if you did but cry long enough for it but be sure of this that it can never please her <\s>
<s> you take a young woman off the boards of a country theatre and prefer her for such is the case to one of the finest ladies in england <\s>
<s> and your mother will submit to your choice but you can't suppose that she will be happy under it <\s>
<s> i have often fancied entre nous that my sister had it in her eye to make a marriage between you and that little ward of hers flora laura what's her name <\s>
<s> and i always determined to do my small endeavour to prevent any such match <\s>
<s> the child has but two thousand pounds i am given to understand <\s>
<s> it is only with the utmost economy and care that my sister can provide for the decent maintenance of her house and for your appearance and education as a gentleman and i don't care to own to you that i had other and much higher views for you <\s>
<s> with your name and birth sir with your talents which i suppose are respectable with the friends whom i have the honour to possess i could have placed you in an excellent position a remarkable position for a young man of such exceeding small means and had hoped to see you at least try to restore the honours of our name <\s>
<s> your mother's softness stopped one prospect or you might have been a general like our gallant ancestor who fought at ramillies and malplaquet <\s>
<s> i had another plan in view my excellent and kind friend lord bagwig who is very well disposed towards me would i have little doubt have attached you to his mission at pumpernickel and you might have advanced in the diplomatic service <\s>
<s> but pardon me for recurring to the subject how is a man to serve a young gentleman of eighteen who proposes to marry a lady of thirty whom he has selected from a booth in a fair well not a fair a barn <\s>
<s> that profession at once is closed to you <\s>
<s> the public service is closed to you <\s>
<s> society is closed to you <\s>
<s> you see my good friend to what you bring yourself <\s>
<s> you may get on at the bar to be sure where i am given to understand that gentlemen of merit occasionally marry out of their kitchens but in no other profession <\s>
<s> or you may come and live down here down here mon dieu <\s>
<s> for ever said the major with a dreary shrug as he thought with inexpressible fondness of pall mall where your mother will receive the mrs <\s>
<s> arthur that is to be with perfect kindness where the good people of the county won't visit you and where by gad sir i shall be shy of visiting you myself for i'm a plain spoken man and i own to you that i like to live with gentlemen for my companions where you will have to live with rum and water drinking gentlemen farmers and drag through your life the young husband of an old woman who if she doesn't quarrel with your mother will at least cost that lady her position in society and drag her down into that dubious caste into which you must inevitably fall <\s>
<s> it is no affair of mine my good sir <\s>
<s> i am not angry <\s>
<s> your downfall will not hurt me farther than that it will extinguish the hopes i had of seeing my family once more taking its place in the world <\s>
<s> it is only your mother and yourself that will be ruined <\s>
<s> and i pity you both from my soul <\s>
<s> pass the claret it is some i sent to your poor father i remember i bought it at poor lord levant's sale <\s>
<s> but of course added the major smacking the wine having engaged yourself you will do what becomes you as a man of honour however fatal your promise may be <\s>
<s> however promise us on our side my boy what i set out by entreating you to grant that there shall be nothing clandestine that you will pursue your studies that you will only visit your interesting friend at proper intervals <\s>
<s> do you write to her much <\s>
<s> pen blushed and said why yes he had written <\s>
<s> i suppose verses eh <\s>
<s> as well as prose <\s>
<s> i was a dab at verses myself <\s>
<s> i recollect when i first joined i used to write verses for the fellows in the regiment and did some pretty things in that way <\s>
<s> i was talking to my old friend general hobbler about some lines i dashed off for him in the year 1806 when we were at the cape and gad he remembered every line of them still for he'd used em so often the old rogue and had actually tried em on mrs <\s>
<s> hobbler sir who brought him sixty thousand pounds <\s>
<s> i suppose you've tried verses eh pen <\s>
<s> pen blushed again and said why yes he had written verses <\s>
<s> and does the fair one respond in poetry or prose <\s>
<s> asked the major eyeing his nephew with the queerest expression as much as to say o moses and green spectacles <\s>
<s> what a fool the boy is <\s>
<s> she had written but not in verse the young lover owned and he gave his breast pocket the benefit of a squeeze with his left arm which the major remarked according to his wont <\s>
<s> you have got the letters there i see said the old campaigner nodding at pen and pointing to his own chest which was manfully wadded with cotton by mr <\s>
<s> you know you have <\s>
<s> i would give twopence to see em <\s>
<s> why said pen twiddling the stalks of the strawberries i i but this sentence never finished for pen's face was so comical and embarrassed as the major watched it that the elder could contain his gravity no longer and burst into a fit of laughter in which chorus pen himself was obliged to join after a minute when he broke out fairly into a guffaw <\s>
<s> it sent them with great good humour into mrs <\s>
<s> she was pleased to hear them laughing in the hall as they crossed it <\s>
<s> said the major putting his arm gaily on pen's shoulder and giving a playful push at the boy's breast pocket <\s>
<s> he felt the papers crackling there sure enough <\s>
<s> the young fellow was delighted conceited triumphant and in one word a spoony <\s>
<s> the pair came to the tea table in the highest spirits <\s>
<s> the major's politeness was beyond expression <\s>
<s> he had never tasted such good tea and such bread was only to be had in the country <\s>
<s> pendennis for one of her charming songs <\s>
<s> he then made pen sing and was delighted and astonished at the beauty of the boy's voice he made his nephew fetch his maps and drawings and praised them as really remarkable works of talent in a young fellow he complimented him on his french pronunciation he flattered the simple boy as adroitly as ever lover flattered a mistress and when bedtime came mother and son went to their several rooms perfectly enchanted with the kind major <\s>
<s> when they had reached those apartments i suppose helen took to her knees as usual and pen read over his letters before going to bed just as if he didn't know every word of them by heart already <\s>
<s> in truth there were but three of those documents and to learn their contents required no great effort of memory <\s>
<s> 1 miss fotheringay presents grateful compliments to mr <\s>
<s> pendennis and in her papa's name and her own begs to thank him for his most beautiful presents <\s>
<s> they will always be kept carefully and miss f <\s>
<s> will never forget the delightful evening which they passed on tuesday last <\s>
<s> 2 said dear sir we shall have a small quiet party of social friends at our humble board next tuesday evening at an early tea when i shall wear the beautiful scarf which with its accompanying delightful verses i shall ever ever cherish and papa bids me say how happy he will be if you will join the feast of reason and the flow of soul in our festive little party as i am sure will be your truly grateful emily fotheringay <\s>
<s> 3 was somewhat more confidential and showed that matters had proceeded rather far <\s>
<s> you were odious yesterday night the letter said <\s>
<s> why did you not come to the stage door <\s>
<s> papa could not escort me on account of his eye he had an accident and fell down over a loose carpet on the stair on sunday night <\s>
<s> i saw you looking at miss diggle all night and you were so enchanted with lydia languish you scarcely once looked at julia <\s>
<s> i could have crushed bingley i was so angry <\s>
<s> i play ella rosenberg on friday will you come then <\s>
<s> miss diggle performs ever your e <\s>
<s> these three letters mr <\s>
<s> pen used to read at intervals during the day and night and embrace with that delight and fervour which such beautiful compositions surely warranted <\s>
<s> a thousand times at least he had kissed fondly the musky satin paper made sacred to him by the hand of emily fotheringay <\s>
<s> this was all he had in return for his passion and flames his vows and protests his rhymes and similes his wakeful nights and endless thoughts his fondness fears and folly <\s>
<s> the young wiseacre had pledged away his all for this signed his name to endless promissory notes conferring his heart upon the bearer bound himself for life and got back twopence as an equivalent <\s>
<s> for miss costigan was a young lady of such perfect good conduct and self command that she never would have thought of giving more and reserved the treasures of her affection until she could transfer them lawfully at church <\s>
<s> pen was content with what tokens of regard he had got and mumbled over his three letters in a rapture of high spirits and went to sleep delighted with his kind old uncle from london who must evidently yield to his wishes in time and in a word in a preposterous state of contentment with himself and all the world <\s>
<s> in which the major opens the campaign let those who have a real and heartfelt relish for london society and the privilege of an entree into its most select circles admit that major pendennis was a man of no ordinary generosity and affection in the sacrifice which he now made <\s>
<s> he gave up london in may his newspapers and his mornings his afternoons from club to club his little confidential visits to my ladies his rides in rotten row his dinners and his stall at the opera his rapid escapades to fulham or richmond on saturdays and sundays his bow from my lord duke or my lord marquis at the great london entertainments and his name in the morning post of the succeeding day his quieter little festivals more select secret and delightful all these he resigned to lock himself into a lone little country house with a simple widow and a greenhorn of a son a mawkish curate and a little girl of ten years of age <\s>
<s> he made the sacrifice and it was the greater that few knew the extent of it <\s>
<s> his letters came down franked from town and he showed the invitations to helen with a sigh <\s>
<s> it was beautiful and tragical to see him refuse one party after another at least to those who could understand as helen didn't the melancholy grandeur of his self denial <\s>
<s> helen did not or only smiled at the awful pathos with which the major spoke of the court guide in general but young pen looked with great respect at the great names upon the superscriptions of his uncle's letters and listened to the major's stories about the fashionable world with constant interest and sympathy <\s>
<s> the elder pendennis's rich memory was stored with thousands of these delightful tales and he poured them into pen's willing ear with unfailing eloquence <\s>
<s> he knew the name and pedigree of everybody in the peerage and everybody's relations <\s>
<s> my dear boy he would say with a mournful earnestness and veracity you cannot begin your genealogical studies too early i wish to heavens you would read in debrett every day <\s>
<s> not so much the historical part for the pedigrees between ourselves are many of them very fabulous and there are few families that can show such a clear descent as our own as the account of family alliances and who is related to whom <\s>
<s> i have known a man's career in life blasted by ignorance on this important this all important subject <\s>
<s> why only last month at dinner at my lord hobanob's a young man who has lately been received among us young mr <\s>
<s> suckling author of a work i believe began to speak lightly of admiral bowser's conduct for ratting to ministers in what i must own is the most audacious manner <\s>
<s> but who do you think sate next and opposite to this mr <\s>
<s> why why next to him was lady grampound bowser's daughter and opposite to him was lord grampound bowser's son in law <\s>
<s> the infatuated young man went on cutting his jokes at the admiral's expense fancying that all the world was laughing with him and i leave you to imagine lady hobanob's feelings hobanob's those of every well bred man as the wretched intru was so exposing himself <\s>
<s> he will never dine again in south street <\s>
<s> i promise you that <\s>
<s> with such discourses the major entertained his nephew as he paced the terrace in front of the house for his two hours constitutional walk or as they sate together after dinner over their wine <\s>
<s> he grieved that sir francis clavering had not come down to the park to live in it since his marriage and to make a society for the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> he mourned that lord eyrie was not in the country that he might take pen and present him to his lordship <\s>
<s> he has daughters the major said <\s>
<s> you might have married lady emily or lady barbara trehawk but all those dreams are over my poor fellow you must lie on the bed which you have made for yourself <\s>
<s> these things to hear did young pendennis seriously incline <\s>
<s> they are not so interesting in print as when delivered orally but the major's anecdotes of the great george of the royal dukes of the statesmen beauties and fashionable ladies of the day filled young pen's soul with longing and wonder and he found the conversations with his guardian which sadly bored and perplexed poor mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis for his own part never tedious <\s>
<s> it can't be said that mr <\s>
<s> pen's new guide philosopher and friend discoursed him on the most elevated subjects or treated the subjects which he chose in the most elevated manner <\s>
<s> but his morality such as it was was consistent <\s>
<s> it might not perhaps tend to a man's progress in another world but it was pretty well calculated to advance his interests in this and then it must be remembered that the major never for one instant doubted that his views were the only views practicable and that his conduct was perfectly virtuous and respectable <\s>
<s> he was a man of honour in a word and had his eyes what he called open <\s>
<s> he took pity on this young greenhorn of a nephew and wanted to open his eyes too <\s>
<s> no man for instance went more regularly to church when in the country than the old bachelor <\s>
<s> it don't matter so much in town pen he said for there the women go and the men are not missed <\s>
<s> but when a gentleman is sur ses terres he must give an example to the country people and if i could turn a tune i even think i should sing <\s>
<s> the duke of saint david's whom i have the honour of knowing always sings in the country and let me tell you it has a doosed fine effect from the family pew <\s>
<s> and you are somebody down here <\s>
<s> as long as the claverings are away you are the first man in the parish and as good as any <\s>
<s> you might represent the town if you played your cards well <\s>
<s> your poor dear father would have done so had he lived so might you not if you marry a lady however amiable whom the country people won't meet well well it's a painful subject <\s>
<s> let us change it my boy <\s>
<s> but if major pendennis changed the subject once he recurred to it a score of times in the day and the moral of his discourse always was that pen was throwing himself away <\s>
<s> now it does not require much coaxing or wheedling to make a simple boy believe that he is a very fine fellow <\s>
<s> pen took his uncle's counsels to heart <\s>
<s> he was glad enough we have said to listen to his elder's talk <\s>
<s> the conversation of captain costigan became by no means pleasant to him and the idea of that tipsy old father in law haunted him with terror <\s>
<s> he couldn't bring that man unshaven and reeking of punch to associate with his mother <\s>
<s> even about emily he faltered when the pitiless guardian began to question him <\s>
<s> he was obliged to own no <\s>
<s> well she had a very good average intellect but he could not absolutely say she was clever <\s>
<s> come let us see some of her letters <\s>
<s> so pen confessed that he had but those three of which we have made mention and that they were but trivial invitations or answers <\s>
<s> she is cautious enough the major said drily <\s>
<s> she is older than you my poor boy and then he apologised with the utmost frankness and humility and flung himself upon pen's good feelings begging the lad to excuse a fond old uncle who had only his family's honour in view for arthur was ready to flame up in indignation whenever miss costigan's honesty was doubted and swore that he would never have her name mentioned lightly and never never would part from her <\s>
<s> he repeated this to his uncle and his friends at home and also it must be confessed to miss fotheringay and the amiable family at chatteris with whom he still continued to spend some portion of his time <\s>
<s> miss emily was alarmed when she heard of the arrival of pen's guardian and rightly conceived that the major came down with hostile intentions to herself <\s>
<s> i suppose ye intend to leave me now your grand relation has come down from town <\s>
<s> he'll carry ye off and you'll forget your poor emily mr <\s>
<s> in her presence in that of miss rouncy the columbine and milly's confidential friend of the company in the presence of the captain himself pen swore he never could think of any other woman but his beloved miss fotheringay and the captain looking up at his foils which were hung as a trophy on the wall of the room where pen and he used to fence grimly said he would not advoise any man to meddle rashly with the affections of his darling child and would never believe his gallant young arthur whom he treated as his son whom he called his son would ever be guilty of conduct so revolting to every idaya of honour and humanity <\s>
<s> he went up and embraced pen after speaking <\s>
<s> he cried and wiped his eye with one large dirty hand as he clasped pen with the other <\s>
<s> arthur shuddered in that grasp and thought of his uncle at home <\s>
<s> his father in law looked unusually dirty and shabby the odour of whisky and water was even more decided than in common <\s>
<s> how was he to bring that man and his mother together <\s>
<s> he trembled when he thought that he had absolutely written to costigan enclosing to him a sovereign the loan of which the worthy gentleman had need and saying that one day he hoped to sign himself his affectionate son arthur pendennis <\s>
<s> he was glad to get away from chatteris that day from miss rouncy the confidante from the old toping father in law from the divine emily herself <\s>
<s> o emily emily he cried inwardly as he rattled homewards on rebecca you little know what sacrifices i am making for you for you who are always so cold so cautious so mistrustful and he thought of a character in pope to whom he had often involuntarily compared her <\s>
<s> pen never rode over to chatteris upon a certain errand but the major found out on what errand the boy had been <\s>
<s> faithful to his plan major pendennis gave his nephew no let or hindrance but somehow the constant feeling that the senior's eye was upon him an uneasy shame attendant upon that inevitable confession which the evening's conversation would be sure to elicit in the most natural simple manner made pen go less frequently to sigh away his soul at the feet of his charmer than he had been wont to do previous to his uncle's arrival <\s>
<s> there was no use trying to deceive him there was no pretext of dining with smirke or reading greek plays with foker pen felt when he returned from one of his flying visits that everybody knew whence he came and appeared quite guilty before his mother and guardian over their books or their game at picquet <\s>
<s> once having walked out half a mile to the fairoaks inn beyond the lodge gates to be in readiness for the competitor coach which changed horses there to take a run for chatteris a man on the roof touched his hat to the young gentleman it was his uncle's man mr <\s>

<s> morgan came back by the rival too so that pen had the pleasure of that domestic's company both ways <\s>
<s> nothing was said at home <\s>
<s> the lad seemed to have every decent liberty and yet he felt himself dimly watched and guarded and that there were eyes upon him even in the presence of his dulcinea <\s>
<s> in fact pen's suspicions were not unfounded and his guardian had sent forth to gather all possible information regarding the lad and his interesting young friend <\s>
<s> the discreet and ingenious mr <\s>
<s> morgan a london confidential valet whose fidelity could be trusted had been to chatteris more than once and made every inquiry regarding the past history and present habits of the captain and his daughter <\s>
<s> he delicately cross examined the waiters the ostlers and all the inmates of the bar at the george and got from them what little they knew respecting the worthy captain <\s>
<s> he was not held in very great regard there as it appeared <\s>
<s> the waiters never saw the colour of his money and were warned not to furnish the poor gentleman with any liquor for which some other party was not responsible <\s>
<s> he swaggered sadly about the coffee room there consumed a toothpick and looked over the paper and if any friend asked him to dinner he stayed <\s>
<s> morgan heard at the george of pen's acquaintance with mr <\s>
<s> foker and he went over to baymouth to enter into relations with that gentleman's man but the young student was gone to a coast regatta and his servant of course travelled in charge of the dressing case <\s>
<s> from the servants of the officers at the barracks mr <\s>
<s> morgan found that the captain had so frequently and outrageously inebriated himself there that colonel swallowtail had forbidden him the messroom <\s>
<s> the indefatigable morgan then put himself in communication with some of the inferior actors at the theatre and pumped them over their cigars and punch and all agreed that costigan was poor shabby and given to debt and to drink <\s>
<s> but there was not a breath upon the reputation of miss fotheringay her father's courage was reported to have displayed itself on more than one occasion towards persons disposed to treat his daughter with freedom <\s>
<s> she never came to the theatre but with her father in his most inebriated moments that gentleman kept a watch over her finally mr <\s>
<s> morgan from his own experience added that he had been to see her act and was uncommon delighted with the performance besides thinking her a most splendid woman <\s>
<s> creed the pew opener confirmed these statements to doctor portman who examined her personally and threatened her with the terrors of the church one day after afternoon service <\s>
<s> creed had nothing unfavourable to her lodger to divulge <\s>

<s> foker which was often together and which was always driving over from baymouth in the tandem <\s>
<s> but on the occasions of the lessons miss f <\s>
<s> was very seldom present and generally came downstairs to mrs <\s>

<s> creed said she always have me or one of the children with her <\s>
<s> creed marm says she if you please marm you'll on no account leave the room when that young gentleman's here <\s>
<s> and many's the time i've seen him a lookin as if he wished i was away poor young man and he took to coming in service time when i wasn't at home of course but she always had one of the boys up if her pa wasn't at home or old mr <\s>
<s> bowser with her a teaching of her her lesson or one of the young ladies of the theayter <\s>
<s> it was all true whatever encouragements might have been given him before he avowed his passion the prudence of miss emily was prodigious after pen had declared himself and the poor fellow chafed against her hopeless reserve which maintained his ardour as it excited his anger <\s>
<s> the major surveyed the state of things with a sigh <\s>
<s> if it were but a temporary liaison the excellent man said one could bear it <\s>
<s> a young fellow must sow his wild oats and that sort of thing <\s>
<s> but a virtuous attachment is the deuce <\s>
<s> it comes of the d  d romantic notions boys get from being brought up by women <\s>
<s> allow me to say major that you speak a little too like a man of the world replied the doctor <\s>
<s> nothing can be more desirable for pen than a virtuous attachment for a young lady of his own rank and with a corresponding fortune this present infatuation of course i must deplore as sincerely as you do <\s>
<s> if i were his guardian i should command him to give it up <\s>
<s> the very means i tell you to make him marry to morrow <\s>
<s> we have got time from him that is all and we must do our best with that <\s>
<s> i say major said the doctor at the end of the conversation in which the above subject was discussed i am not of course a play going man but suppose i say we go and see her <\s>
<s> the major laughed he had been a fortnight at fairoaks and strange to say had not thought of that <\s>
<s> well he said why not <\s>
<s> after all it is not my niece but miss fotheringay the actress and we have as good a right as any other of the public to see her if we pay our money <\s>
<s> so upon a day when it was arranged that pen was to dine at home and pass the evening with his mother the two elderly gentlemen drove over to chatteris in the doctor's chaise and there like a couple of jolly bachelors dined at the george inn before proceeding to the play <\s>
<s> only two other guests were in the room an officer of the regiment quartered at chatteris and a young gentleman whom the doctor thought he had somewhere seen <\s>

<s> it was hamlet over again <\s>
<s> shakspeare was article xl <\s>
<s> of stout old doctor portman's creed to which he always made a point of testifying publicly at least once in a year <\s>
<s> we have described the play before and how those who saw miss fotheringay perform in ophelia saw precisely the same thing on one night as on another <\s>
<s> both the elderly gentlemen looked at her with extraordinary interest thinking how very much young pen was charmed with her <\s>
<s> gad said the major between his teeth as he surveyed her when she was called forward as usual and swept her curtsies to the scanty audience the young rascal has not made a bad choice <\s>
<s> the doctor applauded her loudly and loyally <\s>
<s> upon my word said he she is a very clever actress and i must say major she is endowed with very considerable personal attractions <\s>
<s> so that young officer thinks in the stage box major pendennis answered and he pointed out to doctor portman's attention the young dragoon of the george coffee room who sate in the box in question and applauded with immense enthusiasm <\s>
<s> she looked extremely sweet upon him too thought the major but that's their way and he shut up his natty opera glass and pocketed it as if he wished to see no more that night <\s>

<s> facing the enemy sauntering slowly homewards major pendennis reached the george presently and found mr <\s>
<s> morgan his faithful valet awaiting him at the door of the george inn who stopped his master as he was about to take a candle to go to bed and said with his usual air of knowing deference i think sir if you would go into the coffee room there's a young gentleman there as you would like to see <\s>
<s> the major said in great anger <\s>
<s> no sir but his great friend mr <\s>
<s> lady hagnes foker's son is here sir <\s>
<s> he's been asleep in the coffee room since he took his dinner and has just rung for his coffee sir <\s>
<s> and i think p'raps you might like to git into conversation with him the valet said opening the coffee room door <\s>
<s> the major entered and there indeed was mr <\s>
<s> foker the only occupant of the place <\s>
<s> he was rubbing his eyes and sate before a table rated with empty decanters and relics of dessert <\s>
<s> he had intended to go to the play too but sleep had overtaken him after a copious meal and he had flung up his legs on the bench and indulged in a nap instead of the dramatic amusement <\s>
<s> the major was meditating how to address the young man but the latter prevented him that trouble <\s>
<s> like to look at the evening paper sir <\s>
<s> foker who was always communicative and affable and he took up the globe from his table and offered it to the new comer <\s>
<s> i am very much obliged to you said the major with a grateful bow and smile <\s>
<s> if i don't mistake the family likeness i have the pleasure of speaking to mr <\s>
<s> henry foker lady agnes foker's son <\s>
<s> i have the happiness to name her ladyship among my acquaintances and you bear sir a rosherville face <\s>
<s> i beg your pardon mr <\s>
<s> foker said i took you he was going to say i took you for a commercial gent <\s>
<s> but he stopped that phrase <\s>
<s> to whom have i the pleasure of speaking <\s>
<s> to a relative of a friend and schoolfellow of yours arthur pendennis my nephew who has often spoken to me about you in terms of great regard <\s>
<s> i am major pendennis of whom you may have heard him speak <\s>
<s> may i take my soda water at your table <\s>
<s> i have had the pleasure of sitting at your grandfather's <\s>
<s> sir you do me proud said mr <\s>
<s> foker with much courtesy <\s>
<s> and so you are arthur pendennis's uncle are you <\s>
<s> and guardian added the major <\s>
<s> he's as good a fellow as ever stepped sir said mr <\s>
<s> i am glad you think so <\s>
<s> and clever too i was always a stupid chap i was but you see sir i know em when they are clever and like em of that sort <\s>
<s> you show your taste and your modesty too said the major <\s>
<s> i have heard arthur repeatedly speak of you and he said your talents were very good <\s>
<s> i'm not good at the books mr <\s>
<s> foker said wagging his head never could manage that pendennis could he used to do half the chaps verses and yet the young gentleman broke out you are his guardian and i hope you will pardon me for saying that i think he's what we call flat the candid young gentleman said <\s>
<s> the major found himself on the instant in the midst of a most interesting and confidential conversation <\s>
<s> and how is arthur a flat <\s>
<s> he asked with a smile <\s>
<s> you know foker answered winking at him he would have winked at the duke of wellington with just as little scruple for he was in that state of absence candour and fearlessness which a man sometimes possesses after drinking a couple of bottles of wine you know arthur's a flat about women i mean <\s>
<s> he is not the first of us my dear mr <\s>
<s> harry answered the major <\s>
<s> i have heard something of this but pray tell me more <\s>
<s> why sir you see it's partly my fault <\s>
<s> he went to the play one night for you see i'm down here readin for my little go during the long only i come over from baymouth pretty often in my drag well sir we went to the play and pen was struck all of a heap with miss fotheringay costigan her real name is an uncommon fine gal she is too and the next morning i introduced him to the general as we call her father a regular old scamp and such a boy for the whisky and water and he's gone on being intimate there <\s>
<s> and he's fallen in love with her and i'm blessed if he hasn't proposed to her foker said slapping his hand on the table until all the dessert began to jingle <\s>
<s> you know it too <\s>
<s> and many more too <\s>
<s> we were talking about it at mess yesterday and chaffing derby oaks until he was as mad as a hatter <\s>
<s> know sir derby oaks <\s>
<s> we dined together and he went to the play we were standing at the door smoking i remember when you passed in to dinner <\s>
<s> i remember sir thomas oaks his father before he was a baronet or a knight he lived in cavendish square and was physician to queen charlotte <\s>
<s> the young one is making the money spin i can tell you mr <\s>
<s> and is sir derby oaks the major said with great delight and anxiety another soupirant <\s>
<s> another admirer of miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> we call him mondays wednesdays and fridays and pen tuesdays thursdays and saturdays <\s>
<s> but mind you nothing wrong <\s>
<s> is a deal too wide awake for that major pendennis <\s>
<s> she plays one off against the other <\s>
<s> what you call two strings to her bow <\s>
<s> i think you seem tolerably wide awake too mr <\s>
<s> foker pendennis said laughing <\s>
<s> pretty well thank you sir how are you <\s>
<s> i'm not clever p'raps but i am rather downy and partial friends say i know what's o'clock tolerably well <\s>
<s> can i tell you the time of day in any way <\s>
<s> upon my word the major answered quite delighted i think you may be of very great service to me <\s>
<s> you are a young man of the world and with such one likes to deal <\s>
<s> and as such i need not inform you that our family is by no means delighted at this absurd intrigue in which arthur is engaged <\s>
<s> i should rather think not said mr <\s>
<s> too much beer drunk on the premises <\s>
<s> no irish need apply <\s>
<s> that i take to be your meaning <\s>
<s> the major said it was exactly though in truth he did not quite understand what mr <\s>
<s> foker's meaning was and he proceeded to examine his new acquaintance regarding the amiable family into which his nephew proposed to enter and soon got from the candid witness a number of particulars regarding the house of costigan <\s>
<s> we must do mr <\s>
<s> foker the justice to say that he spoke most favourably of mr <\s>
<s> and miss costigan's moral character <\s>
<s> you see said he i think the general is fond of the jovial bowl and if i wanted to be very certain of my money it isn't in his pocket i'd invest it but he has always kept a watchful eye on his daughter and neither he nor she will stand anything but what's honourable <\s>
<s> pen's attentions to her are talked about in the whole company and i hear all about them from a young lady who used to be very intimate with her and with whose family i sometimes take tea in a friendly way <\s>
<s> miss rouncy says sir derby oaks has been hanging about miss fotheringay ever since his regiment has been down here but pen has come in and cut him out lately which has made the baronet so mad that he has been very near on the point of proposing too <\s>
<s> wish he would and you'd see which of the two miss fotheringay would jump at <\s>
<s> i thought as much the major said <\s>
<s> you give me a great deal of pleasure mr <\s>
<s> i wish i could have seen you before <\s>
<s> didn't like to put in my oar replied the other <\s>
<s> don't speak till i'm asked when if there's no objections i speak pretty freely <\s>
<s> heard your man had been hankering about my servant didn't know myself what was going on until miss fotheringay and miss rouncy had the row about the ostrich feathers when miss r <\s>
<s> miss rouncy i gather was the confidante of the other <\s>
<s> why she's twice as clever a girl as fotheringay and literary and that while miss foth can't do much more than read <\s>
<s> she can write said the major remembering pen's breast pocket <\s>
<s> foker broke out into a sardonic he he <\s>
<s> rouncy writes her letters he said every one of em and since they've quarrelled she don't know how the deuce to get on <\s>
<s> miss rouncy is an uncommon pretty hand whereas the old one makes dreadful work of the writing and spelling when bows ain't by <\s>
<s> rouncy's been settin her copies lately she writes a beautiful hand rouncy does <\s>
<s> i suppose you know it pretty well said the major archly upon which mr <\s>
<s> foker winked at him again <\s>
<s> i would give a great deal to have a specimen of her hand writing continued major pendennis i dare say you could give me one <\s>
<s> no no that would be too bad foker replied <\s>
<s> perhaps i oughtn't to have said as much as i have <\s>
<s> miss f s writin ain't so very bad i dare say only she got miss r <\s>
<s> to write the first letter and has gone on ever since <\s>
<s> but you mark my word that till they are friends again the letters will stop <\s>
<s> i hope they will never be reconciled the major said with great sincerity and i can't tell you how delighted i am to have had the good fortune of making your acquaintance <\s>
<s> you must feel my dear sir as a man of the world how fatal to my nephew's prospects in life is this step which he contemplates and how eager we all must be to free him from this absurd engagement <\s>
<s> he has come out uncommon strong said mr <\s>
<s> foker i have seen his verses rouncy copied em <\s>
<s> and i said to myself when i saw em catch me writin verses to a woman that's all he has made a fool of himself as many a good fellow has before him <\s>
<s> how can we make him see his folly and cure it <\s>
<s> i am sure you will give us what aid you can in extricating a generous young man from such a pair of schemers as this father and daughter seem to be <\s>
<s> love on the lady's side is out of the question <\s>
<s> if pen hadn't two thousand a year when he came of age if pen hadn't what <\s>
<s> cried out the major in astonishment <\s>
<s> two thousand a year hasn't he got two thousand a year the general says he has <\s>
<s> my dear friend shrieked out the major with an eagerness which this gentleman rarely showed thank you thank you i begin to see now two thousand a year <\s>
<s> why his mother has but five hundred a year in the world she is likely to live to eighty and arthur has not a shilling but what she can allow him <\s>
<s> he ain't rich then <\s>
<s> upon my honour he has no more than what i say <\s>
<s> and you ain't going to leave him anything <\s>
<s> the major had sunk every shilling he could scrape together on an annuity and of course was going to leave pen nothing but he did not tell foker this <\s>
<s> how much do you think a major on half pay can save <\s>
<s> if these people have been looking at him as a fortune they are utterly mistaken and and you have made me the happiest man in the world <\s>
<s> sir to you said mr <\s>
<s> foker politely and when they parted for the night they shook hands with the greatest cordiality the younger gentleman promising the elder not to leave chatteris without a further conversation in the morning <\s>
<s> and as the major went up to his room and mr <\s>
<s> foker smoked his cigar against the door pillars of the george pen very likely ten miles off was lying in bed kissing the letter from his emily <\s>
<s> the next morning before mr <\s>
<s> foker drove off in his drag the insinuating major had actually got a letter of miss rouncy's in his own pocket book <\s>
<s> let it be a lesson to women how they write <\s>
<s> and in very high spirits major pendennis went to call upon doctor portman at the deanery and told him what happy discoveries he had made on the previous night <\s>
<s> as they sate in confidential conversation in the dean's oak breakfast parlour they could look across the lawn and see captain costigan's window at which poor pen had been only too visible some three weeks since <\s>
<s> the doctor was most indignant against mrs <\s>
<s> creed the landlady for her duplicity in concealing sir derby oaks's constant visits to her lodgers and threatened to excommunicate her out of the cathedral <\s>
<s> but the wary major thought that all things were for the best and having taken counsel with himself over night felt himself quite strong enough to go and face captain costigan <\s>
<s> i'm going to fight the dragon he said with a laugh to doctor portman <\s>
<s> and i shrive you sir and bid good fortune go with you answered the doctor <\s>
<s> perhaps he and mrs <\s>
<s> portman and miss myra as they sate with their friend the dean's lady in her drawing room looked up more than once at the enemy's window to see if they could perceive any signs of the combat <\s>
<s> the major walked round according to the directions given him and soon found mrs <\s>
<s> he passed it and as he ascended to captain costigan's apartment he could hear a stamping of feet and a great shouting of ha ha <\s>
<s> it's sir derby oaks taking his fencing lesson said the child who piloted major pendennis <\s>
<s> he takes it mondays wednesdays and fridays <\s>
<s> the major knocked and at length a tall gentleman came forth with a foil and mask in one hand and a fencing glove on the other <\s>
<s> pendennis made him a deferential bow <\s>
<s> i believe i have the honour of speaking to captain costigan my name is major pendennis <\s>
<s> the captain brought his weapon up to the salute and said major the honer is moine i'm deloighted to see ye <\s>
<s> negotiation the major and captain costigan were old soldiers and accustomed to face the enemy so we may presume that they retained their presence of mind perfectly but the rest of the party assembled in cos's sitting room were perhaps a little flurried at pendennis's apparition <\s>
<s> miss fotheringay's slow heart began to beat no doubt for her cheek flushed up with a great healthy blush as lieutenant sir derby oaks looked at her with a scowl <\s>
<s> the little crooked old man in the window seat who had been witnessing the fencing match between the two gentlemen whose stamping and jumping had been such as to cause him to give up all attempts to continue writing the theatre music in the copying of which he had been engaged looked up eagerly towards the new comer as the major of the well blacked boots entered the apartment distributing the most graceful bows to everybody present <\s>
<s> me daughter me friend mr <\s>
<s> bows me gallant young pupil and friend i may call um sir derby oaks said costigan splendidly waving his hand and pointing each of these individuals to the major's attention <\s>
<s> in one moment meejor i'm your humble servant and to dash into the little adjoining chamber where he slept to give a twist to his lank hair with his hair brush a wonderful and ancient piece to tear off his old stock and put on a new one which emily had constructed for him and to assume a handsome clean collar and the new coat which had been ordered upon the occasion of miss fotheringay's benefit was with the still active costigan the work of a minute <\s>
<s> after him sir derby entered and presently emerged from the same apartment where he also cased himself in his little shell jacket which fitted tightly upon the young officer's big person and which he and miss fotheringay and poor pen too perhaps admired prodigiously <\s>
<s> meanwhile conversation was engaged between the actress and the new comer and the usual remarks about the weather had been interchanged before costigan re entered in his new shoot as he called it <\s>
<s> i needn't apologoise to ye meejor he said in his richest and most courteous manner for receiving ye in me shirt sleeves <\s>
<s> an old soldier can't be better employed than in teaching a young one the use of his sword answered the major gallantly <\s>
<s> i remember in old times hearing that you could use yours pretty well captain costigan <\s>
<s> what ye've heard of jack costigan major said the other greatly <\s>
<s> the major had indeed he had pumped his nephew concerning his new friend the irish officer and whether he had no other knowledge of the captain than what he had thus gained or whether he actually remembered him we cannot say <\s>
<s> but major pendennis was a person of honour and undoubted veracity and said that he perfectly well recollected meeting mr <\s>
<s> costigan and hearing him sing at sir richard strachan's table at walcheren <\s>
<s> at this information and the bland and cordial manner in which it was conveyed bows looked up entirely puzzled <\s>
<s> but we will talk of these matters another time the major continued perhaps not wishing to commit himself it is to miss fotheringay that i came to pay my respects to day and he performed another bow for her so courtly and gracious that if she had been a duchess he could not have made it more handsome <\s>
<s> i had heard of your performances from my nephew madam the major said who raves about you as i believe you know pretty well <\s>
<s> but arthur is but a boy and a wild enthusiastic young fellow whose opinions one must not take au pied de la lettre and i confess i was anxious to judge for myself <\s>
<s> permit me to say your performance delighted and astonished me <\s>
<s> i have seen our best actresses and on my word i think you surpass them all <\s>
<s> you are as majestic as mrs <\s>
<s> faith i always said so costigan said winking at his daughter major take a chair <\s>
<s> milly rose at this hint took an uuripped satin garment off the only vacant seat and brought the latter to major pendennis with one of her finest curtseys <\s>
<s> you are as pathetic as miss o'neill he continued bowing and seating himself your snatches of song reminded me of mrs <\s>
<s> jordan in her best time when we were young men captain costigan and your manner reminded me of mars <\s>
<s> did you ever see the mars miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> there was two mahers in crow street remarked miss emily fanny was well enough but biddy was no great things <\s>
<s> sure the major means the god of war milly my dear interposed the parent <\s>
<s> it is not that mars i meant though venus i suppose may be pardoned for thinking about him the major replied with a smile directed in full to sir derby oaks who now re entered in his shell jacket but the lady did not understand the words of which he made use nor did the compliment at all pacify sir derby who probably did not understand it either and at any rate received it with great sulkiness and stiffness scowling uneasily at miss fotheringay with an expression which seemed to ask what the deuce does this man here <\s>
<s> major pendennis was not in the least annoyed by the gentleman's ill humour <\s>
<s> on the contrary it delighted him <\s>
<s> so thought he a rival is in the field and he offered up vows that sir derby might be not only a rival but a winner too in this love match in which he and pen were engaged <\s>
<s> i fear i interrupted your fencing lesson but my stay in chatteris is very short and i was anxious to make myself known to my old fellow campaigner captain costigan and to see a lady nearer who had charmed me so much from the stage <\s>
<s> i was not the only man epris last night miss fotheringay if i must call you so though your own family name is a very ancient and noble one <\s>
<s> there was a reverend friend of mine who went home in raptures with ophelia and i saw sir derby oaks fling a bouquet which no actress ever merited better <\s>
<s> i should have brought one myself had i known what i was going to see <\s>
<s> are not those the very flowers in a glass of water on the mantelpiece yonder <\s>
<s> i am very fond of flowers said miss fotheringay with a languishing ogle at sir derby oaks but the baronet still scowled sulkily <\s>
<s> sweets to the sweet isn't that the expression of the play <\s>
<s> pendennis asked bent upon being good humoured <\s>
<s> pon my life i don't know <\s>
<s> very likely it is <\s>
<s> i ain't much of a literary man answered sir derby <\s>
<s> the major continued with an air of surprise <\s>
<s> you don't inherit your father's love of letters then sir derby <\s>
<s> he was a remarkably fine scholar and i had the honour of knowing him very well <\s>
<s> indeed said the other and gave a sulky wag of his head <\s>
<s> he saved my life continued pendennis <\s>
<s> cried miss fotheringay rolling her eyes first upon the major with surprise then towards sir derby with gratitude but the latter was proof against those glances and far from appearing to be pleased that the apothecary his father should have saved major pendennis's life the young man actually looked as if he wished the event had turned the other way <\s>
<s> my father i believe was a very good doctor the young gentleman said by way of reply <\s>
<s> i'm not in that line myself <\s>
<s> i wish you good morning sir <\s>
<s> i've got an appointment cos bye bye miss fotheringay good morning <\s>
<s> and in spite of the young lady's imploring looks and appealing smiles the dragoon bowed stiffly out of the room and the clatter of his sabre was heard as he strode down the creaking stair and the angry tones of his voice as he cursed little tom creed who was disporting in the passage and whose peg top sir derby kicked away with an oath into the street <\s>
<s> the major did not smile in the least though he had every reason to be amused <\s>
<s> monstrous handsome young man that as fine a looking soldier as ever i saw he said to costigan <\s>
<s> a credit to the army and to human nature in general answered costigan <\s>
<s> a young man of refoined manners polite affabilitee and princely fortune <\s>
<s> his table is sumptuous he's adawr'd in the regiment and he rides sixteen stone <\s>
<s> a perfect champion said the major laughing <\s>
<s> i have no doubt all the ladies admire him <\s>
<s> he's very well in spite of his weight now he's young said milly but he's no conversation <\s>
<s> he's best on horseback mr <\s>
<s> bows said on which milly replied that the baronet had ridden third in the steeple chase on his horse tareaways and the major began to comprehend that the young lady herself was not of a particular genius and to wonder how she should be so stupid and act so well <\s>
<s> costigan with irish hospitality of course pressed refreshment upon his guest and the major who was no more hungry than you are after a lord mayor's dinner declared that he should like a biscuit and a glass of wine above all things as he felt quite faint from long fasting but he knew that to receive small kindnesses flatters the donors very much and that people must needs grow well disposed towards you as they give you their hospitality <\s>
<s> some of the old madara milly love costigan said winking to his child and that lady turning to her father a glance of intelligence went out of the room and down the stair where she softly summoned her little emissary master tommy creed and giving him a piece of money ordered him to go buy a pint of madara wine at the grapes and sixpennyworth of sorted biscuits at the baker's and to return in a hurry when he might have two biscuits for himself <\s>
<s> whilst tommy creed was gone on this errand miss costigan sate below with mrs <\s>

<s> she keeps the keys of the cellar major said mr <\s>
<s> costigan as the girl left the room <\s>
<s> upon my word you have a very beautiful butler answered pendennis gallantly and i don't wonder at the young fellows raving about her <\s>
<s> when we were of their age captain costigan i think plainer women would have done our business <\s>
<s> faith and ye may say that sir and lucky is the man who gets her <\s>
<s> ask me friend bob bows here whether miss fotheringay's moind is not even shuparior to her person and whether she does not possess a cultiveated intellect a refoined understanding and an emiable disposition <\s>
<s> o of course said mr <\s>
<s> here comes hebe blushing from the cellar <\s>
<s> don't you think it is time to go to rehearsal miss hebe <\s>
<s> you will be fined if you are later and he gave the young lady a look which intimated that they had much better leave the room and the two elders together <\s>
<s> at this order miss hebe took up her bonnet and shawl looking uncommonly pretty good humoured and smiling and bows gathered up his roll of papers and hobbled across the room for his hat and cane <\s>
<s> can't you give us a few minutes more miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> before you leave us permit an old fellow to shake you by the hand and believe that i am proud to have had the honour of making your acquaintance and am most sincerely anxious to be your friend <\s>
<s> miss fotheringay made a low curtsey at the conclusion of this gallant speech and the major followed her retreating steps to the door where he squeezed her hand with the kindest and most paternal pressure <\s>
<s> bows was puzzled with this exhibition of cordiality the lad's relatives can't be really wanting to marry him to her he thought and so they departed <\s>
<s> now for it thought major pendennis and as for mr <\s>
<s> costigan he profited instantaneously by his daughter's absence to drink up the rest of the wine and tossed off one bumper after another of the madeira from the grapes with an eager shaking hand <\s>
<s> the major came up to the table and took up his glass and drained it with a jovial smack <\s>
<s> if it had been lord steyne's particular and not public house cape he could not have appeared to relish it more <\s>

<s> where do you get it <\s>
<s> i drink the health of that charming creature in a bumper <\s>
<s> faith captain i don't wonder that the men are wild about her <\s>
<s> i never saw such eyes in my life or such a grand manner <\s>
<s> i am sure she is as intellectual as she is beautiful and i have no doubt she's as good as she is clever <\s>
<s> a good girl sir a good girl sir said the delighted father and i pledge a toast to her with all my heart <\s>

<s> well indeed sir ye may say she is a good girl and the pride and glory of her father honest old jack costigan <\s>
<s> the man who gets her will have a jew'l to a wife sir and i drink his health sir and ye know who i mean major <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at young or old falling in love with her said the major and frankly must tell you that though i was very angry with my poor nephew arthur when i heard of the boy's passion now i have seen the lady i can pardon him any extent of it <\s>
<s> by george i should like to enter for the race myself if i weren't an old fellow and a poor one <\s>
<s> and no better man major i'm sure cried jack enraptured <\s>
<s> your friendship sir delights me <\s>
<s> your admiration for my girl brings tears to me eyes tears sir manlee tears and when she leaves me humble home for your own more splendid mansion i hope she'll keep a place for her poor old father poor old jack costigan the captain suited the action to the word and his bloodshot eyes were suffused with water as he addressed the major <\s>
<s> your sentiments do you honour the other said <\s>
<s> but captain costigan i can't help smiling at one thing you have just said <\s>
<s> and what's that sir <\s>
<s> asked jack who was at a too heroic and sentimental pitch to descend from it <\s>
<s> you were speaking about our splendid mansion my sister's house i mean <\s>
<s> i mane the park and mansion of arthur pendennis esquire of fairoaks park whom i hope to see a mimber of parliament for his native town of clavering when he is of ege to take that responsible stetion cried the captain with much dignity <\s>
<s> the major smiled as he recognised a shaft of his own bow <\s>
<s> it was he who had set pen upon the idea of sitting in parliament for the neighbouring borough and the poor lad had evidently been bragging on the subject to costigan and the lady of his affections <\s>
<s> fairoaks park my dear sir he said <\s>
<s> do you know our history <\s>
<s> we are of excessively ancient family certainly but i began life with scarce enough money to purchase my commission and my eldest brother was a country apothecary who made every shilling he died possessed of out of his pestle and mortar <\s>
<s> i have consented to waive that objection sir said costigan majestically in consideration of the known respectability of your family <\s>
<s> curse your impudence thought the major but he only smiled and bowed <\s>
<s> the costigans too have met with misfortunes and our house of castle costigan is by no manes what it was <\s>
<s> i have known very honest men apothecaries sir and there's some in dublin that has had the honour of dining at the lord leftenant's teeble <\s>
<s> you are very kind to give us the benefit of your charity the major continued but permit me to say that is not the question <\s>
<s> you spoke just now of my little nephew as heir of fairoaks park and i don't know what besides <\s>
<s> funded property i've no doubt meejor and something handsome eventually from yourself <\s>
<s> my good sir i tell you the boy is the son of a country apothecary cried out major pendennis and that when he comes of age he won't have a shilling <\s>
<s> pooh major you're laughing at me said mr <\s>
<s> costigan me young friend i make no doubt is heir to two thousand pounds a year <\s>
<s> i beg your pardon my dear sir but has the boy been humbugging you it is not his habit <\s>
<s> upon my word and honour as a gentleman and an executor to my brother's will too he left little more than five hundred a year behind him <\s>
<s> and with aconomy a handsome sum of money too sir the captain answered <\s>
<s> faith i've known a man drink his clar't and drive his coach and four on five hundred a year and strict aconomy in ireland sir <\s>
<s> we'll manage on it sir trust jack costigan for that <\s>
<s> my dear captain costigan i give you my word that my brother did not leave a shilling to his son arthur <\s>
<s> are ye joking with me meejor pendennis <\s>
<s> are ye thrifling with the feelings of a father and a gentleman <\s>
<s> i am telling you the honest truth said major pendennis <\s>
<s> every shilling my brother had he left to his widow with a partial reversion it is true to the boy <\s>
<s> but she is a young woman and may marry if he offends her or she may outlive him for she comes of an uncommonly long lived family <\s>
<s> and i ask you as a gentleman and a man of the world what allowance can my sister mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis make to her son out of five hundred a year which is all her fortune that shall enable him to maintain himself and your daughter in the rank befitting such an accomplished young lady <\s>
<s> am i to understand sir that the young gentleman your nephew and whom i have fosthered and cherished as the son of me bosom is an imposther who has been thrifling with the affections of me beloved child <\s>
<s> exclaimed the general with an outbreak of wrath have you yourself been working upon the feelings of the young man's susceptible nature to injuice him to break off an engagement and with it me adored emily's heart <\s>
<s> have a care sir how you thrifle with the honour of john costigan <\s>
<s> if i thought any mortal man meant to do so be heavens i'd have his blood sir were he old or young <\s>
<s> cried out the major <\s>
<s> costigan can protect his own and his daughter's honour and will sir said the other <\s>
<s> look at that chest of dthrawers it contains heaps of letthers that that viper has addressed to that innocent child <\s>
<s> there's promises there sir enough to fill a bandbox with and when i have dragged the scoundthrel before the courts of law and shown up his perjury and his dishonour i have another remedy in yondther mahogany case sir which shall set me right sir with any individual ye mark me words major pendennis with any individual who has counselled your nephew to insult a soldier and a gentleman <\s>
<s> me daughter to be jilted and me grey hairs dishonoured by an apothecary's son <\s>
<s> by the laws of heaven sir i should like to see the man that shall do it <\s>
<s> i am to understand then that you threaten in the first place to publish the letters of a boy of eighteen to a woman of eight and twenty and afterwards to do me the honour of calling me out the major said still with perfect coolness <\s>
<s> you have described my intentions with perfect accuracy meejor pendennis answered the captain as he pulled his ragged whiskers over his chin <\s>
<s> well well these shall be the subjects of future arrangements but before we come to powder and ball my good sir do have the kindness to think with yourself in what earthly way i have injured you <\s>
<s> i have told you that my nephew is dependent upon his mother who has scarcely more than five hundred a year <\s>
<s> i have my own opinion of the correctness of that assertion said the captain <\s>
<s> will you go to my sister's lawyers messrs <\s>
<s> tatham here and satisfy yourself <\s>
<s> i decline to meet those gentlemen said the captain with rather a disturbed air <\s>
<s> if it be as you say i have been athrociously deceived by some one and on that person i'll be revenged <\s>
<s> is it my nephew <\s>
<s> cried the major starting up and putting on his hat <\s>
<s> did he ever tell you that his property was two thousand a year <\s>
<s> if he did i'm mistaken in the boy <\s>
<s> to tell lies has not been a habit in our family mr <\s>
<s> costigan and i don't think my brother's son has learned it as yet <\s>
<s> try and consider whether you have not deceived yourself or adopted extravagant reports from hearsay as for me sir you are at liberty to understand that i am not afraid of all the costigans in ireland and know quite well how to defend myself against any threats from any quarter <\s>
<s> i come here as the boy's guardian to protest against a marriage most absurd and unequal that cannot but bring poverty and misery with it and in preventing it i conceive i am quite as much your daughter's friend who i have no doubt is an honourable young lady as the friend of my own family and prevent the marriage i will sir by every means in my power <\s>
<s> there i have said my say sir <\s>
<s> but i have not said mine major pendennis and ye shall hear more from me mr <\s>
<s> costigan said with a look of tremendous severity <\s>
<s> sdeath sir what do you mean <\s>
<s> the major asked turning round on the threshold of the door and looking the intrepid costigan in the face <\s>
<s> ye said in the coorse of conversation that ye were at the george hotel i think mr <\s>
<s> costigan said in a stately manner <\s>
<s> a friend shall wait upon ye there before ye leave town sir <\s>
<s> let him make haste mr <\s>
<s> costigan cried out the major almost beside himself with rage <\s>
<s> i wish you a good morning sir <\s>
<s> and captain costigan bowed a magnificent bow of defiance to major pendennis over the landing place as the latter retreated down the stairs <\s>
<s> in which a shooting match is proposed early mention has been made in this history of mr <\s>
<s> garbetts principal tragedian a promising and athletic young actor of jovial habits and irregular inclinations between whom and mr <\s>
<s> costigan there was a considerable intimacy <\s>
<s> they were the chief ornaments of the convivial club held at the magpie hotel they helped each other in various bill transactions in which they had been engaged with the mutual loan of each other's valuable signatures <\s>
<s> they were friends in fine although mr <\s>
<s> garbetts seldom called at costigan's house being disliked by miss fotheringay of whom in her turn mrs <\s>
<s> garbetts was considerably jealous <\s>
<s> the truth is that garbetts had paid his court to miss fotheringay and been refused by her before he offered his hand to mrs <\s>
<s> their history however forms no part of our present scheme suffice it mr <\s>
<s> garbetts was called in by captain costigan immediately after his daughter and mr <\s>
<s> bows had quitted the house as a friend proper to be consulted at the actual juncture <\s>
<s> he was a large man with a loud voice and fierce aspect who had the finest legs of the whole company and could break a poker in mere sport across his stalwart arm <\s>
<s> run tommy said mr <\s>
<s> costigan to the little messenger and fetch mr <\s>
<s> garbetts from his lodgings over the tripe shop ye know and tell em to send two glasses of whisky and water hot from the grapes <\s>
<s> so tommy went his way and presently mr <\s>
<s> garbetts and the whisky came <\s>
<s> captain costigan did not disclose to him the whole of the previous events of which the reader is in possession but with the aid of the spirits and water he composed a letter of a threatening nature to major pendennis's address in which he called upon that gentleman to offer no hindrance to the marriage projected between mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis and his daughter miss fotheringay and to fix an early day for its celebration or in any other case to give him the satisfaction which was usual between gentlemen of honour <\s>
<s> and should major pendennis be disinclined to this alternative the captain hinted that he would force him to accept by the use of a horsewhip which he should employ upon the major's person <\s>
<s> the precise terms of this letter we cannot give for reasons which shall be specified presently but it was no doubt couched in the captain's finest style and sealed elaborately with the great silver seal of the costigans the only bit of the family plate which the captain possessed <\s>
<s> garbetts was despatched then with this message and letter and bidding heaven bless um the general squeezed his ambassador's hand and saw him depart <\s>
<s> then he took down his venerable and murderous duelling pistols with flint locks that had done the business of many a pretty fellow in dublin and having examined these and seen that they were in a satisfactory condition he brought from the drawer all pen's letters and poems which he kept there and which he always read before he permitted his emily to enjoy their perusal <\s>
<s> in a score of minutes garbetts came back with an anxious and crestfallen countenance <\s>
<s> why yes said garbetts <\s>
<s> and when is it for <\s>
<s> asked costigan trying the lock of one of the ancient pistols and bringing it to a level with his oi as he called that bloodshot orb <\s>
<s> when is what for <\s>
<s> the meeting my dear fellow <\s>
<s> you don't mean to say you mean mortal combat captain garbetts said aghast <\s>
<s> what the devil else do i mean garbetts i want to shoot that man that has trajuiced me honor or meself dthrop a victim on the sod <\s>
<s> d if i carry challenges mr <\s>
<s> i'm a family man captain and will have nothing to do with pistols take back your letter and to the surprise and indignation of captain costigan his emissary flung the letter down with its great sprawling superscription and blotched seal <\s>
<s> ye don't mean to say ye saw um and didn't give um the letter <\s>
<s> cried out the captain in a fury <\s>
<s> i saw him but i could not have speech with him captain said mr <\s>
<s> and why the devil not <\s>
<s> there was one there i cared not to meet nor would you the tragedian answered in a sepulchral voice <\s>
<s> the minion tatham was there captain <\s>
<s> he's frightened and already going to swear the peace against me <\s>
<s> i'll have nothing to do with the fighting mark that the tragedian doggedly said and i wish i'd not seen tatham neither nor that bit of hold your tongue bob acres <\s>
<s> it's my belief ye're no better than a coward said captain costigan quoting sir lucius o'trigger which character he had performed with credit both off and on the stage and after some more parley between the couple they separated in not very good humour <\s>
<s> their colloquy has been here condensed as the reader knows the main point upon which it turned <\s>
<s> but the latter will now see how it is impossible to give a correct account of the letter which the captain wrote to major pendennis as it was never opened at all by that gentleman <\s>
<s> when miss costigan came home from rehearsal which she did in the company of the faithful mr <\s>
<s> bows she found her father pacing up and down their apartment in a great state of agitation and in the midst of a powerful odour of spirits and water which as it appeared had not succeeded in pacifying his disordered mind <\s>
<s> the pendennis papers were on the table surrounding the empty goblets and now useless teaspoon which had served to hold and mix the captain's liquor and his friend's <\s>
<s> as emily entered he seized her in his arms and cried out prepare yourself me child me blessed child in a voice of agony and with eyes brimful of tears <\s>
<s> ye're tipsy again papa miss fotheringay said pushing back her sire <\s>
<s> ye promised me ye wouldn't take spirits before dinner <\s>
<s> it's to forget me sorrows me poor girl that i've taken just a drop cried the bereaved father it's to drown me care that i drain the bowl <\s>
<s> your care takes a deal of drowning captain dear said bows mimicking his friend's accent what has happened <\s>
<s> has that soft spoken gentleman in the wig been vexing you <\s>
<s> i'll have his blood <\s>
<s> miss milly it must be premised had fled to her room out of his embrace and was taking off her bonnet and shawl there <\s>
<s> i thought he meant mischief <\s>
<s> he was so uncommon civil the other said <\s>
<s> what has he come to say <\s>
<s> he has overwhellum'd me the captain said <\s>
<s> there's a hellish conspiracy on foot against me poor girl and it's me opinion that both them pendennises nephew and uncle is two infernal thrators and scoundthrels who should be conshumed from off the face of the earth <\s>
<s> bows growing rather excited <\s>
<s> costigan then told him the major's statement that the young pendennis had not two thousand nor two hundred pounds a year and expressed his fury that he should have permitted such an impostor to coax and wheedle his innocent girl and that he should have nourished such a viper in his own personal bosom <\s>
<s> i have shaken the reptile from me however said costigan and as for his uncle i'll have such a revenge on that old man as shall make um rue the day he ever insulted a costigan <\s>
<s> what do you mean general <\s>
<s> i mean to have his life bows his villanous skulking life my boy and he rapped upon the battered old pistol case in an ominous and savage manner <\s>
<s> bows had often heard him appeal to that box of death with which he proposed to sacrifice his enemies but the captain did not tell him that he had actually written and sent a challenge to major pendennis and mr <\s>
<s> bows therefore rather disregarded the pistols in the present instance <\s>
<s> at this juncture miss fotheringay returned to the common sitting room from her private apartment looking perfectly healthy happy and unconcerned a striking and wholesome contrast to her father who was in a delirious tremor of grief anger and other agitation <\s>
<s> she brought in a pair of ex white satin shoes with her which she proposed to rub as clean as might be with bread crumb intending to go mad with them upon next tuesday evening in ophelia in which character she was to reappear on that night <\s>
<s> she looked at the papers on the table stopped as if she was going to ask a question but thought better of it and going to the cupboard selected an eligible piece of bread wherewith she might operate on the satin slippers and afterwards coming back to the table seated herself there commodiously with the shoes and then asked her father in her honest irish brogue what have ye got them letthers and pothry and stuff of master arthur's out for pa <\s>
<s> sure ye don't want to be reading over that nonsense <\s>
<s> cried the captain that boy whom i loved as the boy of mee bosom is only a scoundthrel and a deceiver mee poor girl and he looked in the most tragical way at mr <\s>
<s> bows opposite who in his turn gazed somewhat anxiously at miss costigan <\s>
<s> sure the poor lad's as simple as a schoolboy she said <\s>
<s> all them children write verses and nonsense <\s>
<s> he's been acting the part of a viper to this fireside and a traitor in this familee cried the captain <\s>
<s> i tell ye he's no better than an impostor <\s>
<s> what has the poor fellow done papa <\s>
<s> he has deceived us in the most athrocious manner miss emily's papa said <\s>
<s> he has thrifled with your affections and outraged my own fine feelings <\s>
<s> he has represented himself as a man of property and it turruns out that he is no betther than a beggar <\s>
<s> haven't i often told ye he had two thousand a year <\s>
<s> he's a pauper i tell ye miss costigan a depindent upon the bountee of his mother a good woman who may marry again who's likely to live for ever and who has but five hundred a year <\s>
<s> how dar he ask ye to marry into a family which has not the means of providing for ye <\s>
<s> ye've been grossly deceived and put upon milly and it's my belief his old ruffian of an uncle in a wig is in the plot against us <\s>
<s> that soft old gentleman <\s>
<s> what has he been doing papa <\s>
<s> continued emily still imperturbable <\s>
<s> costigan informed milly that when she was gone major pendennis told him in his double faced pall mall polite manner that young arthur had no fortune at all that the major had asked him costigan to go to the lawyers wherein he knew the scoundthrels have a bill of mine and i can't meet them the captain parenthetically remarked and see the lad's father's will and finally that an infernal swindle had been practised upon him by the pair and that he was resolved either on a marriage or on the blood of both of them <\s>
<s> milly looked very grave and thoughtful rubbing the white satin shoes <\s>
<s> sure if he's no money there's no use marrying him papa she said sententiously <\s>
<s> why did the villain say he was a man of prawpertee <\s>
<s> the poor fellow always said he was poor answered the girl <\s>
<s> twas you would have it he was rich papa and made me agree to take him <\s>
<s> he should have been explicit and told us his income milly answered the father <\s>
<s> a young fellow who rides a blood mare and makes presents of shawls and bracelets is an impostor if he has no money and as for his uncle bedad i'll pull off his wig whenever i see um <\s>
<s> bows here shall take a message to him and tell him so <\s>
<s> either it's a marriage or he meets me in the field like a man or i tweak um on the nose in front of his hotel or in the gravel walks of fairoaks park before all the county bedad <\s>
<s> bedad you may send somebody else with the message said bows laughing <\s>
<s> i'm a fiddler not a fighting man captain <\s>
<s> pooh you've no spirit sir roared the general <\s>
<s> i'll be my own second if no one will stand by and see me injured <\s>
<s> and i'll take my case of pistols and shoot um in the coffee room of the george <\s>
<s> and so poor arthur has no money <\s>
<s> sighed out miss costigan rather plaintively <\s>
<s> poor lad he was a good lad too wild and talking nonsense with his verses and pothry and that but a brave generous boy and indeed i liked him and he liked me too she added rather softly and rubbing away at the shoe <\s>
<s> why don't you marry him if you like him so <\s>
<s> bows said rather savagely <\s>
<s> he is not more than ten years younger than you are <\s>
<s> his mother may relent and you might go and live and have enough at fairoaks park <\s>
<s> why not go and be a lady <\s>
<s> i could go on with the fiddle and the general live on his half pay <\s>
<s> why don't you marry him <\s>
<s> you know he likes you <\s>
<s> there's others that likes me as well bows that has no money and that's old enough miss milly said sententiously <\s>
<s> yes d it said bows with a bitter curse that are old enough and poor enough and fools enough for anything <\s>
<s> there's old fools and young fools too <\s>
<s> you've often said so you silly man the imperious beauty said with a conscious glance at the old gentleman <\s>
<s> if pendennis has not enough money to live upon it's folly to talk about marrying him and that's the long and short of it <\s>
<s> you throw a man away like an old glove miss costigan <\s>
<s> i don't know what you mean bows said miss fotheringay placidly rubbing the second shoe <\s>
<s> if he had had half of the two thousand a year that papa gave him or the half of that i would marry him <\s>
<s> but what is the good of taking on with a beggar <\s>
<s> we're poor enough already <\s>
<s> there's no use in my going to live with an old lady that's testy and cross maybe and would grudge me every morsel of meat <\s>
<s> sure it's near dinner time and suky not laid the cloth yet and then added miss costigan quite simply suppose there was a family why papa we shouldn't be as well off as we are now <\s>
<s> deed then you would not milly dear answered the father <\s>
<s> and there's an end to all the fine talk about mrs <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis of fairoaks park the member of parliament's lady said milly with a laugh <\s>
<s> pretty carriages and horses we should have to ride that you were always talking about papa <\s>
<s> but it's always the same <\s>
<s> if a man looked at me you fancied he was going to marry me and if he had a good coat you fancied he was as rich as crazes <\s>
<s> as croesus said mr <\s>
<s> well call um what ye like <\s>
<s> but it's a fact now that papa has married me these eight years a score of times <\s>
<s> wasn't i to be my lady poldoody of oystherstown castle <\s>
<s> then there was the navy captain at portsmouth and the old surgeon at norwich and the methodist preacher here last year and who knows how many more <\s>
<s> well i bet a penny with all your scheming i shall die milly costigan at last <\s>
<s> so poor little arthur has no money <\s>
<s> stop and take dinner bows we've a beautiful beef steak pudding <\s>
<s> i wonder whether she is on with sir derby oaks thought bows whose eyes and thoughts were always watching her <\s>
<s> the dodges of women beat all comprehension and i am sure she wouldn't let the lad off so easily if she had not some other scheme on hand <\s>
<s> it will have been perceived that miss fotheringay though silent in general and by no means brilliant as a conversationist where poetry literature or the fine arts were concerned could talk freely and with good sense too in her own family circle <\s>

<s> the major was by no means sorry at the ludicrous issue of the quarrel <\s>
<s> it seems to me sir he said to mr <\s>
<s> foker that you always arrive to put me into good humour <\s>
<s> nor was this the only occasion on which mr <\s>
<s> foker this day was destined to be of service to the pendennis family <\s>
<s> we have said that he had the entree of captain costigan's lodgings and in the course of the afternoon he thought he would pay the general a visit and hear from his own lips what had occurred in the conversation in the morning with mr <\s>

<s> he had received permission nay encouragement from his daughter to go to the convivial club at the magpie hotel where no doubt he was bragging at that moment of his desire to murder a certain ruffian for he was not only brave but he knew it too and liked to take out his courage and as it were give it an airing in company <\s>
<s> costigan then was absent but miss fotheringay was at home washing the tea cups whilst mr <\s>

<s> just done breakfast i see how do <\s>
<s> foker popping in his little funny head <\s>
<s> get out you funny little man cried miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> you mean come in answered the other here we are <\s>
<s> and entering the room he folded his arms and began twirling his head round and round with immense rapidity like harlequin in the pantomime when he first issues from his cocoon or envelope <\s>
<s> miss fotheringay laughed with all her heart a wink of foker's would set her off laughing when the bitterest joke bows ever made could not get a smile from her or the finest of poor pen's speeches would only puzzle her <\s>
<s> at the end of the harlequinade he sank down on one knee and kissed her hand <\s>
<s> you're the drollest little man she said and gave him a great good humoured slap <\s>
<s> pen used to tremble as he kissed her hand <\s>
<s> pen would have died of a slap <\s>
<s> these preliminaries over the three began to talk mr <\s>
<s> foker amused his companions by recounting to them the scene which he had just witnessed of the discomfiture of mr <\s>
<s> garbetts by which they learned for the first time how far the general had carried his wrath against major pendennis <\s>
<s> foker spoke strongly in favour of the major's character for veracity and honour and described him as a tip top swell moving in the upper circle of society who would never submit to any deceit much more to deceive such a charming young woman as miss foth <\s>
<s> he touched delicately upon the delicate marriage question though he couldn't help showing that he held pen rather cheap <\s>
<s> in fact he had a perhaps just contempt for mr <\s>
<s> pen's high flown sentimentality his own weakness as he thought not lying that way <\s>
<s> i knew it wouldn't do miss foth said he nodding his little head <\s>
<s> didn't like to put my hand into the bag but knew it couldn't do <\s>
<s> he's too young for you too green a deal too green and he turns out to be poor as job <\s>
<s> can't have him at no price can she mr <\s>
<s> indeed he's a nice poor boy said the fotheringay rather sadly <\s>
<s> poor little beggar said bows with his hands in his pockets and stealing up a queer look at miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> perhaps he thought and wondered at the way in which women play with men and coax them and win them and drop them <\s>
<s> bows had not the least objection to acknowledge that he thought miss fotheringay was perfectly right in giving up mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis and that in his idea the match was always an absurd one and miss costigan owned that she thought so herself only she couldn't send away two thousand a year <\s>
<s> it all comes of believing papa's silly stories she said faith i'll choose for meself another time and very likely the large image of lieutenant sir derby oaks entered into her mind at that instant <\s>
<s> after praising major pendennis whom miss costigan declared to be a proper gentleman entirely smelling of lavender and as neat as a pin and who was pronounced by mr <\s>
<s> bows to be the right sort of fellow though rather too much of an old buck mr <\s>
<s> foker suddenly bethought him to ask the pair to come and meet the major that very evening at dinner at his apartment at the george <\s>
<s> he agreed to dine with me and i think after the after the little shindy this morning in which i must say the general was wrong it would look kind you know i know the major fell in love with you miss foth he said so <\s>
<s> so she may be mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis still bows said with a sneer no thank you mr <\s>
<s> sure that was at three o'clock said miss costigan who had an honest appetite and i can't go without you <\s>
<s> we'll have lobster salad and champagne said the little monster who could not construe a line of latin or do a sum beyond the rule of three <\s>
<s> now for lobster salad and champagne in an honourable manner miss costigan would have gone anywhere and major pendennis actually found himself at seven o'clock seated at a dinner table in company with mr <\s>
<s> bows a professional fiddler and miss costigan whose father had wanted to blow his brains out a few hours before <\s>
<s> to make the happy meeting complete mr <\s>
<s> foker who knew costigan's haunts despatched stoopid to the club at the magpie where the general was in the act of singing a pathetic song and brought him off to supper <\s>
<s> to find his daughter and bows seated at the board was a surprise indeed major pendennis laughed and cordially held out his hand which the general officer grasped avec effusion as the french say <\s>
<s> in fact he was considerably inebriated and had already been crying over his own song before he joined the little party at the george <\s>
<s> he burst into tears more than once during the entertainment and called the major his dearest friend <\s>
<s> foker walked home with him the major gallantly giving his arm to miss costigan <\s>
<s> he was received with great friendliness when he called the next day when many civilities passed between the gentlemen <\s>
<s> on taking leave he expressed his anxious desire to serve miss costigan on any occasion in which he could be useful to her and he shook hands with mr <\s>
<s> foker most cordially and gratefully and said that gentleman had done him the very greatest service <\s>
<s> all right said mr <\s>
<s> foker and they parted with mutual esteem <\s>
<s> on his return to fairoaks the next day major pendennis did not say what had happened to him on the previous night or allude to the company in which he had passed it <\s>
<s> but he engaged mr <\s>
<s> smirke to stop to dinner and any person accustomed to watch his manner might have remarked that there was something constrained in his hilarity and talkativeness and that he was unusually gracious and watchful in his communications with his nephew <\s>
<s> he gave pen an emphatic god bless you when the lad went to bed and as they were about to part for the night he seemed as if he was going to say something to mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis but he bethought him that if he spoke he might spoil her night's rest and allowed her to sleep in peace <\s>
<s> the next morning he was down in the breakfast room earlier than was his custom and saluted everybody there with great cordiality <\s>

<s> he knew the hand it was that of old costigan and he did not care to read it in public <\s>
<s> major pendennis knew the letter too <\s>

<s> the affair is at an end major pendennis said <\s>

<s> it stated what the major had said that mr <\s>
<s> costigan was most gratified for the kindness with which arthur had treated his daughter but that he was only now made aware of mr <\s>
<s> they were such that marriage was at present out of the question and considering the great disparity in the age of the two a future union was impossible <\s>
<s> under these circumstances and with the deepest regret and esteem for him mr <\s>
<s> costigan bade arthur farewell and suggested that he should cease visiting for some time at least at his house <\s>
<s> a few lines from miss costigan were enclosed <\s>

<s> she would always be grateful for his kindness to her and hoped to keep his friendship <\s>
<s> but at present and until the pain of the separation should be over she entreated they should not meet <\s>
<s> pen read costigan's letter and its enclosure mechanically hardly knowing what was before his eyes <\s>

<s> who has told her lies to break her from me <\s>
<s> lies are not told in the family arthur major pendennis replied <\s>
<s> i told her the truth which was that you had no money to maintain her for her foolish father had represented you to be rich <\s>

<s> i suppose what you say is true sir but i'll hear it from herself <\s>

<s> be a man and comfort your mother my arthur helen said going and embracing him and seeing that the pair were greatly moved major pendennis went out of the room and shut the door upon them wisely judging that they were best alone <\s>
<s> he had won a complete victory <\s>
<s> he actually had brought away pen's letters in his portmanteau from chatteris having complimented mr <\s>
<s> costigan when he returned them by giving him the little promissory note which had disquieted himself and mr <\s>

<s> pen rushed wildly off to chatteris that day but in vain attempted to see miss fotheringay for whom he left a letter enclosed to her father <\s>
<s> the enclosure was returned by mr <\s>
<s> costigan who begged that all correspondence might end and after one or two further attempts of the lad's the indignant general desired that their acquaintance might cease <\s>
<s> he cut pen in the street <\s>
<s> as arthur and foker were pacing the castle walk one day they came upon emily on her father's arm <\s>

<s> he would not obey in this instance and his mother was too fond and his uncle too wise to force him <\s>
<s> whenever miss fotheringay acted he rode over to the chatteris theatre and saw her <\s>
<s> one night there were so few people in the house that the manager returned the money <\s>

<s> scarce anybody was in the theatre <\s>
<s> poor pen had the boxes almost all to himself and sate there lonely with bloodshot eyes leaning over the ledge and gazing haggardly towards the scene when cora came in <\s>
<s> when she was not on the stage he saw nothing <\s>
<s> spaniards and peruvians processions and battles priests and virgins of the sun went in and out and had their talk but arthur took no note of any of them and only saw cora whom his soul longed after <\s>
<s> he said afterwards that he wondered he had not taken a pistol to shoot her so mad was he with love and rage and despair and had it not been for his mother at home to whom he did not speak about his luckless condition but whose silent sympathy and watchfulness greatly comforted the simple half heart broken fellow who knows but he might have done something desperate and have ended his days prematurely in front of chatteris gaol <\s>
<s> there he sate then miserable and gazing at her <\s>

<s> nor had pen noticed the extraordinary change which had taken place on the stage a short time after the entry of these two gentlemen into the theatre <\s>
<s> there were so few people in the house that the first act of the play languished entirely and there had been some question of returning the money as upon that other unfortunate night when poor pen had been driven away <\s>

<s> he had under waistcoats many splendid rings jewelled pins and neck chains <\s>
<s> when he took out his yellow pocket handkerchief with his hand that was cased in white kids a delightful odour of musk and bergamot was shaken through the house <\s>

<s> this sort of knowledge had by no means come within the simple lady's scope <\s>
<s> indeed she did not like the subject or to talk of it her heart had had its own little private misadventure and she had borne up against it and cured it and perhaps she had not much patience with other folk's passions except of course arthur's whose sufferings she made her own feeling indeed very likely in many of the boy's illnesses and pains a great deal more than pen himself endured <\s>
<s> and she watched him through this present grief with a jealous silent sympathy although as we have said he did not talk to her of his unfortunate condition <\s>
<s> the major must be allowed to have had not a little merit and forbearance and to have exhibited a highly creditable degree of family affection <\s>
<s> the life at fairoaks was uncommonly dull to a man who had the entree of half the houses in london and was in the habit of making his bow in three or four drawing rooms of a night <\s>
<s> a dinner with doctor portman or a neighbouring squire now and then a dreary rubber at backgammon with the widow who did her utmost to amuse him these were the chief of his pleasures <\s>
<s> he used to long for the arrival of the bag with the letters and he read every word of the evening paper <\s>
<s> he doctored himself too assiduously a course of quiet living would suit him well he thought after the london banquets <\s>
<s> he dressed himself laboriously every morning and afternoon he took regular exercise up and down the terrace walk <\s>
<s> thus with his cane his toilet his medicine chest his backgammon box and his newspaper this worthy and worldly philosopher fenced himself against ennui and if he did not improve each shining hour like the bees by the widow's garden wall major pendennis made one hour after another pass as he could and rendered his captivity just tolerable <\s>
<s> after this period it was remarked that he was fond of bringing round the conversation to the american war the massacre of wyoming and the brilliant actions of saint lucie the fact being that he had a couple of volumes of the annual register in his bedroom which he sedulously studied <\s>
<s> it is thus a well regulated man will accommodate himself to circumstances and show himself calmly superior to fortune <\s>
<s> pen sometimes took the box at backgammon of a night or would listen to his mother's simple music of summer evenings but he was very restless and wretched in spite of all and has been known to be up before the early daylight even and down at a carp pond in clavering park a dreary pool with innumerable whispering rushes and green alders where a milkmaid drowned herself in the baronet's grandfather's time and her ghost was said to walk still <\s>
<s> but pen did not drown himself as perhaps his mother fancied might be his intention <\s>
<s> he liked to go and fish there and think and think at leisure as the float quivered in the little eddies of the pond and the fish flapped about him <\s>
<s> if he got a bite he was excited enough and in this way occasionally brought home carps tenches and eels which the major cooked in the continental fashion <\s>
<s> by this pond and under a tree which was his favourite resort pen composed a number of poems suitable to his circumstances over which verses he blushed in after days wondering how he could ever have invented such rubbish <\s>
<s> and as for the tree why it is in a hollow of this very tree where he used to put his tin box of ground bait and other fishing commodities that he afterwards but we are advancing matters <\s>
<s> suffice it to say he wrote poems and relieved himself very much <\s>
<s> when a man's grief or passion is at this point it may be loud but it is not very severe <\s>
<s> when a gentleman is cudgelling his brain to find any rhyme for sorrow besides borrow and to morrow his woes are nearer at an end than he thinks for <\s>

<s> foker became a very frequent and welcome visitor at fairoaks during this period where his good spirits and oddities always amused the major and pendennis while they astonished the widow and little laura not a little <\s>
<s> his tandem made a great sensation in clavering market place where he upset a market stall and cut mrs <\s>

<s> all the society in the little place heard who he was and looked out his name in their peerages <\s>

<s> the coward insulted me sir he said and the doctor passed over the oath and respected the emotion of the honest suffering young heart <\s>

<s> stoopid brought back word that the note had been opened by mr <\s>

<s> foker went out to see the curiosities of clavering meanwhile but not having a taste for architecture doctor portman's fine church did not engage his attention much and he pronounced the tower to be as mouldy as an old stilton cheese <\s>
<s> he walked down the street and looked at the few shops there he saw captain glanders at the window of the reading room and having taken a good stare at that gentleman he wagged his head at him in token of satisfaction he inquired the price of meat at the butcher's with an air of the greatest interest and asked when was next killing day <\s>
<s> he flattened his little nose against madame fribsby's window to see if haply there was a pretty workwoman in her premises but there was no face more comely than the doll's or dummy's wearing the french cap in the window only that of madame fribsby herself dimly visible in the parlour reading a novel <\s>
<s> that object was not of sufficient interest to keep mr <\s>
<s> foker very long in contemplation and so having exhausted the town and the inn stables in which there were no cattle save the single old pair of posters that earned a scanty livelihood by transporting the gentry round about to the county dinners mr <\s>

<s> hobnell was at length announced <\s>
<s> it was no other than mr <\s>
<s> wapshot himself who came with an air of great indignation and holding pen's missive in his hand asked mr <\s>
<s> foker how dared he bring such an unchristian message as a challenge to a boy of his school <\s>
<s> in fact pen had written a note to his adversary of the day before telling him that if after the chastisement which his insolence richly deserved he felt inclined to ask the reparation which was usually given amongst gentlemen mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis's friend mr <\s>
<s> henry foker was empowered to make any arrangements for the satisfaction of mr <\s>
<s> and so he sent you with the answer did he sir <\s>
<s> foker said surveying the schoolmaster in his black coat and clerical costume <\s>
<s> if he had accepted this wicked challenge i should have flogged him mr <\s>
<s> wapshot said and gave mr <\s>
<s> foker a glance which seemed to say and i should like very much to flog you too <\s>
<s> uncommon kind of you sir i'm sure said pen's emissary <\s>
<s> i told my principal that i didn't think the other man would fight he continued with a great air of dignity <\s>
<s> he prefers being flogged to fighting sir i dare say <\s>
<s> may i offer you any refreshment mr <\s>
<s> i haven't the advantage of your name <\s>
<s> my name is wapshot sir and i am master of the grammar school of this town sir cried the other and i want no refreshment sir i thank you and have no desire to make your acquaintance sir <\s>
<s> i didn't seek yours sir i'm sure replied mr <\s>
<s> in affairs of this sort you see i think it is a pity that the clergy should be called in but there's no accounting for tastes sir <\s>
<s> i think it's a pity that boys should talk about committing murder sir as lightly as you do roared the schoolmaster and if i had you in my school i dare say you would teach me better sir mr <\s>
<s> foker said with a bow <\s>
<s> i've finished my education sir and ain't a going back to school sir when i do i'll remember your kind offer sir <\s>
<s> john show this gentleman downstairs and of course as mr <\s>
<s> hobnell likes being thrashed we can have no objection sir and we shall be very happy to accommodate him whenever he comes our way <\s>
<s> and with this the young fellow bowed the elder gentleman out of the room and sate down and wrote a note off to pen in which he informed the latter that mr <\s>

<s> more storms in the puddle pen's conduct in this business of course was soon made public and angered his friend doctor portman not a little while it only amused major pendennis <\s>

<s> pendennis she was almost distracted when she heard of the squabble and of pen's unchristian behaviour <\s>
<s> all sorts of wretchedness discomfort crime annoyance seemed to come out of this transaction in which the luckless boy had engaged and she longed more than ever to see him out of chatteris for a while anywhere removed from the woman who had brought him into so much trouble <\s>
<s> pen when remonstrated with by this fond parent and angrily rebuked by the doctor for his violence and ferocious intentions took the matter au grand serieux with the happy conceit and gravity of youth said that he himself was very sorry for the affair that the insult had come upon him without the slightest provocation on his part that he would permit no man to insult him upon this head without vindicating his own honour and appealing with great dignity to his uncle asked whether he could have acted otherwise as a gentleman than as he did in resenting the outrage offered to him and in offering satisfaction to the person chastised <\s>
<s> vous allez trop vite my good sir said the uncle rather puzzled for he had been indoctrinating his nephew with some of his own notions upon the point of honour old world notions savouring of the camp and pistol a great deal more than our soberer opinions of the present day between men of the world i don't say but between two schoolboys this sort of thing is ridiculous my dear boy perfectly ridiculous <\s>

<s> major pendennis grinned and shrugged his shoulders <\s>
<s> the young ones were certainly making great progress he thought <\s>
<s> pendennis declared that that foker was a wicked horrid little wretch and was sure that he would lead her dear boy into mischief if pen went to the same college with him <\s>
<s> i have a great mind not to let him go at all she said and only that she remembered that the lad's father had always destined him for the college in which he had had his own brief education very likely the fond mother would have put a veto upon his going to the university <\s>
<s> that he was to go and at the next october term had been arranged between all the authorities who presided over the lad's welfare <\s>
<s> foker had promised to introduce him to the right set and major pendennis laid great store upon pen's introduction into college life and society by this admirable young gentleman <\s>
<s> foker knows the very best young men now at the university the major said and pen will form acquaintances there who will be of the greatest advantage through life to him <\s>
<s> the young marquis of plinlimmon is there eldest son of the duke of saint david's lord magnus charters is there lord runnymede's son and a first cousin of mr <\s>
<s> foker lady runnymede my dear was lady agatha milton you of course remember ); lady agnes will certainly invite him to logwood and far from being alarmed at his intimacy with her son who is a singular and humorous but most prudent and amiable young man to whom i am sure we are under every obligation for his admirable conduct in the affair of the fotheringay marriage i look upon it as one of the very luckiest things which could have happened to pen that he should have formed an intimacy with this most amusing young gentleman <\s>
<s> helen sighed she supposed the major knew best <\s>
<s> foker had been very kind in the wretched business with miss costigan certainly and she was grateful to him <\s>
<s> but she could not feel otherwise than a dim presentiment of evil and all these quarrels and riots and worldliness scared her about the fate of her boy <\s>
<s> doctor portman was decidedly of opinion that pen should go to college <\s>
<s> he hoped the lad would read and have a moderate indulgence of the best society too <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that pen would distinguish himself smirke spoke very highly of his proficiency the doctor himself had heard him construe and thought he acquitted himself remarkably well <\s>
<s> that he should go out of chatteris was a great point at any rate and pen who was distracted from his private grief by the various rows and troubles which had risen round about him gloomily said he would obey <\s>
<s> there were assizes races and the entertainments and the flux of company consequent upon them at chatteris during a part of the months of august and september and miss fotheringay still continued to act and take farewell of the audiences at the chatteris theatre during that time <\s>
<s> nobody seemed to be particularly affected by her presence or her announced departure except those persons whom we have named nor could the polite county folks who had houses in london and very likely admired the fotheringay prodigiously in the capital when they had been taught to do so by the fashion which set in in her favour find anything remarkable in the actress performing on the little chatteris boards <\s>
<s> many genius and many a quack for that matter has met with a similar fate before and since miss costigan's time <\s>
<s> this honest woman meanwhile bore up against the public neglect and any other crosses or vexations which she might have in life with her usual equanimity and ate drank acted slept with that regularity and comfort which belongs to people of her temperament <\s>
<s> what a deal of grief care and other harmful excitement does a healthy dulness and cheerful insensibility avoid <\s>
<s> nor do i mean to say that virtue is not virtue because it is never tempted to go astray only that dulness is a much finer gift than we give it credit for being and that some people are very lucky whom nature has endowed with a good store of that great anodyne <\s>
<s> pen used to go drearily in and out from the play at chatteris during this season and pretty much according to his fancy <\s>
<s> his proceedings tortured his mother not a little and her anxiety would have led her often to interfere had not the major constantly checked and at the same time encouraged her for the wily man of the world fancied he saw that a favourable turn had occurred in pen's malady <\s>
<s> it was the violent efflux of versification among other symptoms which gave pen's guardian and physician satisfaction <\s>
<s> he might be heard spouting verses in the shrubbery walks or muttering them between his teeth as he sat with the home party of evenings <\s>
<s> one day prowling about the house in pen's absence the major found a great book full of verses in the lad's study <\s>

<s> he can't be very bad wisely thought the pall mall philosopher and he made pen's mother remark not perhaps without a secret feeling of disappointment for she loved romance like other soft women that the young gentleman during the last fortnight came home quite hungry to dinner at night and also showed a very decent appetite at the breakfast table in the morning <\s>

<s> smirke as corydon does the elm tree to cut out his mistress's name upon <\s>
<s> he made him echo with the name of the beautiful amaryllis <\s>
<s> when men have left off playing the tune they do not care much for the pipe but pen thought he had a great friendship for smirke because he could sigh out his loves and griefs into his tutor's ears and smirke had his own reasons for always being ready at the lad's call <\s>
<s> pen's affection gushed out in a multitude of sonnets to the friend of his heart as he styled the curate which the other received with great sympathy <\s>
<s> he plied smirke with latin sapphics and alcaics <\s>
<s> the love songs multiplied under his fluent pen and smirke declared and believed that they were beautiful <\s>
<s> on the other hand pen expressed a boundless gratitude to think that heaven should have sent him such a friend at such a moment <\s>
<s> he presented his tutor with his best bound books and his gold guard chain and wanted him to take his double barrelled gun <\s>
<s> he went into chatteris and got a gold pencil case on credit for he had no money and indeed was still in debt to smirke for some of the fotheringay presents which he presented to smirke with an inscription indicative of his unalterable and eternal regard for the curate who of course was pleased with every mark of the boy's attachment <\s>
<s> the poor curate was naturally very much dismayed at the contemplated departure of his pupil <\s>
<s> when arthur should go smirke's occupation and delight would go too <\s>
<s> what pretext could he find for a daily visit to fairoaks and that kind word or glance from the lady there which was as necessary to the curate as the frugal dinner which madame fribsby served him <\s>
<s> arthur gone he would only be allowed to make visits like any other acquaintance little laura could not accommodate him by learning the catechism more than once a week he had curled himself like ivy round fairoaks he pined at the thought that he must lose his hold of the place <\s>

<s> if he spoke and she refused him it was awful to think that the gate of fairoaks might be shut upon him for ever and within that door lay all the world for mr <\s>
<s> thus oh friendly readers we see how every man in the world has his own private griefs and business by which he is more cast down or occupied than by the affairs or sorrows of any other person <\s>
<s> pendennis is disquieting herself about losing her son and that anxious hold she has had of him as long as he has remained in the mother's nest whence he is about to take flight into the great world beyond while the major's great soul chafes and frets inwardly vexed as he thinks what great parties are going on in london and that he might be sunning himself in the glances of dukes and duchesses but for those cursed affairs which keep him in a wretched little country hole while pen is tossing between his passion and a more agreeable sensation unacknowledged yet but swaying him considerably namely his longing to see the world mr <\s>

<s> let us return however to the solitary smirke <\s>
<s> smirke had one confidante for his passion that most injudicious woman madame fribsby <\s>
<s> how she became madame fribsby nobody knows she had left clavering to go to a milliner's in london as miss fribsby she pretended that she had got the rank in paris during her residence in that city <\s>
<s> but how could the french king were he ever so much disposed give her any such title <\s>
<s> we shall not inquire into this mystery however <\s>
<s> suffice to say she went away from home a bouncing young lass she returned a rather elderly character with a madonna front and a melancholy countenance bought the late mrs <\s>
<s> harbottle's business for a song took her elderly mother to live with her was very good to the poor was constant at church and had the best of characters <\s>
<s> but there was no one in all clavering not mrs <\s>
<s> portman herself who read so many novels as madame fribsby <\s>
<s> she had plenty of time for this amusement for in truth very few people besides the folks at the rectory and fairoaks employed her and by a perpetual perusal of such works which were by no means so moral or edifying in the days of which we write as they are at present she had got to be so absurdly sentimental that in her eyes life was nothing but an immense love match and she never could see two people together but she fancied they were dying for one another <\s>
<s> on the day after mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis's visit to the curate which we have recorded many pages back madame fribsby settled in her mind that mr <\s>
<s> smirke must be in love with the widow and did everything in her power to encourage this passion on both sides <\s>
<s> pendennis she very seldom saw indeed except in public and in her pew at church <\s>
<s> that lady had very little need of millinery or made most of her own dresses and caps but on the rare occasions when madame fribsby received visits from mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis or paid her respects at fairoaks she never failed to entertain the widow with praises of the curate pointing out what an angelical man he was how gentle how studious how lonely and she would wonder that no lady would take pity upon him <\s>
<s> helen laughed at these sentimental remarks and wondered that madame herself did not compassionate her lodger and console him <\s>
<s> madame fribsby shook her madonna front mong cure a boco souffare she said laying her hand on the part she designated as her cure <\s>
<s> it est more en espang madame she said with a sigh <\s>
<s> she was proud of her intimacy with the french language and spoke it with more volubility than correctness <\s>
<s> pendennis did not care to penetrate the secrets of this wounded heart except to her few intimates she was a reserved and it may be a very proud woman she looked upon her son's tutor merely as an attendant on that young prince to be treated with respect as a clergyman certainly but with proper dignity as a dependant on the house of pendennis <\s>
<s> nor were madame's constant allusions to the curate particularly agreeable to her <\s>
<s> it required a very ingenious sentimental turn indeed to find out that the widow had a secret regard for mr <\s>
<s> smirke to which pernicious error however madame fribsby persisted in holding <\s>
<s> her lodger was very much more willing to talk on this subject with his soft hearted landlady <\s>
<s> every time after that she praised the curate to mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis she came away from the latter with the notion that the widow herself had been praising him <\s>
<s> etre soul au monde est bien ouneeyoung she would say glancing up at a print of a french carbineer in a green coat and brass cuirass which decorated her apartment depend upon it when master pendennis goes to college his ma will find herself very lonely <\s>
<s> she is quite young yet you wouldn't suppose her to be five and twenty <\s>
<s> monsieur le cury song cure est touchy j'ang suis sure je conny cela biang ally monsieur smirke <\s>
<s> he softly blushed he sighed he hoped he feared he doubted he sometimes yielded to the delightful idea his pleasure was to sit in madame fribsby's apartment and talk upon the subject where as the greater part of the conversation was carried on in french by the milliner and her old mother was deaf that retired old individual who had once been a housekeeper wife and widow of a butler in the clavering family could understand scarce one syllable of their talk <\s>
<s> thus it was that when major pendennis announced to his nephew's tutor that the young fellow would go to college in october and that mr <\s>
<s> smirke's valuable services would no longer be needful to his pupil for which services the major who spoke as grandly as a lord professed himself exceedingly grateful and besought mr <\s>
<s> smirke to command his interests in any way thus it was that the curate felt that the critical moment was come for him and was racked and tortured by those severe pangs which the occasion warranted <\s>
<s> madame fribsby had of course taken the strongest interest in the progress of mr <\s>
<s> pen's love affair with miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> she had been over to chatteris and having seen that actress perform had pronounced that she was old and overrated and had talked over master pen's passion in her shop many and many a time to the half dozen old maids and old women in male clothes who are to be found in little country towns and who formed the genteel population of clavering <\s>
<s> captain glanders h p had pronounced that pen was going to be a devil of a fellow and had begun early mrs <\s>
<s> glanders had told him to check his horrid observations and to respect his own wife if he pleased <\s>
<s> she said it would be a lesson to helen for her pride and absurd infatuation about that boy <\s>
<s> pybus said many people were proud of very small things and for her part she didn't know why an apothecary's wife should give herself such airs <\s>
<s> wapshot called her daughters away from that side of the street one day when pen on rebecca was stopping at the saddler's to get a new lash to his whip one and all of these people had made visits of curiosity to fairoaks and had tried to condole with the widow or bring the subject of the fotheringay affair on the tapis and had been severally checked by the haughty reserve of mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis supported by the frigid politeness of the major her brother <\s>
<s> these rebuffs however did not put an end to the gossip and slander went on increasing about the unlucky fairoaks family <\s>
<s> glanders h p a retired cavalry officer whose half pay and large family compelled him to fuddle himself with brandy and water instead of claret after he quitted the dragoons had the occasional entree at fairoaks and kept his friend the major there informed of all the stories which were current at clavering <\s>
<s> pybus had taken an inside place by the coach to chatteris and gone to the george on purpose to get the particulars <\s>
<s> speers's man had treated mr <\s>
<s> foker's servant to drink at baymouth for a similar purpose <\s>
<s> it was said that pen had hanged himself for despair in the orchard and that his uncle had cut him down that on the contrary it was miss costigan who was jilted and not young arthur and that the affair had only been hushed up by the payment of a large sum of money the exact amount of which there were several people in clavering could testify the sum of course varying according to the calculation of the individual narrator of the story <\s>
<s> pen shook his mane and raged like a furious lion when these scandals affecting miss costigan's honour and his own came to his ears <\s>
<s> why was not pybus a man she had whiskers enough that he might call her out and shoot her <\s>
<s> seeing simcoe pass by pen glared at him so from his saddle on rebecca and clutched his whip in a manner so menacing that that clergyman went home and wrote a sermon or thought over a sermon for he delivered oral testimony at great length in which he spoke of jezebel theatrical entertainments a double cut this for doctor portman the rector of the old church was known to frequent such and of youth going to perdition in a manner which made it clear to every capacity that pen was the individual meant and on the road alluded to <\s>
<s> what stories more were there not against young pendennis whilst he sate sulking achilles like in his tent for the loss of his ravished briseis <\s>
<s> after the affair with hobnell pen was pronounced to be a murderer as well as a profligate and his name became a name of terror and a byword in clavering <\s>
<s> but this was not all he was not the only one of the family about whom the village began to chatter and his unlucky mother was the next to become a victim to their gossip <\s>
<s> it is all settled said mrs <\s>
<s> speers the boy is to go to college and then the widow is to console herself <\s>
<s> he's been there every day in the most open manner my dear continued mrs <\s>
<s> enough to make poor mr <\s>

<s> and the fact is that madame fribsby had been able to hold out no longer and one day after she and her lodger had been talking of pen's approaching departure and the curate had gone off to give one of his last lessons to that gentleman madame fribsby had communicated to mrs <\s>

<s> you always choose the most charitable reason betsy cried the rector <\s>

<s> you only think men should marry again doctor portman answered his lady bridling up <\s>
<s> you stupid old woman said the doctor when i am gone you shall marry whomsoever you like <\s>
<s> i will leave orders in my will my dear to that effect and i'll bequeath a ring to my successor and my ghost shall come and dance at your wedding <\s>
<s> it is cruel for a clergyman to talk so the lady answered with a ready whimper but these little breezes used to pass very rapidly over the surface of the doctor's domestic bliss and were followed by a great calm and sunshine <\s>
<s> the doctor adopted a plan for soothing mrs <\s>
<s> portman's ruffled countenance which has a great effect when it is tried between a worthy couple who are sincerely fond of one another and which i think becomes john anderson at three score just as much as it used to do when he was a black haired young jo of five and twenty <\s>
<s> hadn't you better speak to mr <\s>
<s> when pen goes to college cadit quaestio replied the rector smirke's visits at fairoaks will cease of themselves and there will be no need to bother the widow <\s>
<s> she has trouble enough on her hands with the affairs of that silly young scapegrace without being pestered by the tittle tattle of this place <\s>
<s> it is all an invention of that fool fribsby <\s>
<s> against whom i always warned you you know i did my dear john interposed mrs <\s>
<s> that you did you very often do my love the doctor answered with a laugh <\s>
<s> it is not for want of warning on your part i am sure that i have formed my opinion of most women with whom we are acquainted <\s>
<s> madame fribsby is a fool and fond of gossip and so are some other folks <\s>
<s> but she is good to the poor she takes care of her mother and she comes to church twice every sunday <\s>
<s> and as for smirke my dear here the doctor's face assumed for one moment a comical expression which mrs <\s>
<s> portman did not perceive for she was looking out of the drawing room window and wondering what mrs <\s>
<s> pybus could want cheapening fowls again in the market when she had bad poultry from livermore's two days before and as for mr <\s>
<s> smirke my dear betsy will you promise me that you will never breathe to any mortal what i am going to tell you as a profound secret <\s>
<s> what is it my dear john of course i won't answered the rector's lady <\s>
<s> well then i cannot say it is a fact mind but if you find that smirke is at this moment ay and has been for years engaged to a young lady a miss a miss thompson if you will have the name who lives on clapham common yes on clapham common not far from mrs <\s>

<s> o gracilis puer cried the doctor whither are you bound <\s>
<s> i wanted you to come home to dinner <\s>
<s> i am engaged to dine at at fairoaks said mr <\s>
<s> smirke blushing faintly and whisking the scented pocket handkerchief and his pony being in waiting he mounted and rode away simpering down the street <\s>
<s> no accident befell him that day and he arrived with his tie in the very best order at mrs <\s>
<s> which concludes the first part of this history the curate had gone on his daily errand to fairoaks and was upstairs in pens study pretending to read with his pupil in the early part of that very afternoon when mrs <\s>
<s> portman after transacting business with mrs <\s>
<s> pybus had found the weather so exceedingly fine that she pursued her walk as far as fairoaks in order to pay a visit to her dear friend there <\s>
<s> in the course of their conversation the rector's lady told mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis and the major a very great secret about the curate mr <\s>
<s> smirke which was no less than that he had an attachment a very old attachment which he had long kept quite private <\s>
<s> and on whom is it that mr <\s>
<s> smirke has bestowed his heart <\s>
<s> pendennis with a superb air but rather an inward alarm <\s>
<s> why my dear the other lady answered when he first came and used to dine at the rectory people said we wanted him for myra and we were forced to give up asking him <\s>
<s> then they used to say he was smitten in another quarter but i always contradicted it for my part and said that you that i cried mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis people are very impertinent i am sure <\s>
<s> smirke came here as arthur's tutor and i am surprised that anybody should dare to speak so pon my soul it is a little too much the major said laying down the newspaper and the double eye glass <\s>
<s> i've no patience with that mrs <\s>
<s> pybus helen continued indignantly <\s>
<s> i told her there was no truth in it mrs <\s>
<s> i always said so my dear and now it comes out that my demure gentleman has been engaged to a young lady miss thompson of clapham common ever so long and i am delighted for my part and on myra's account too for an unmarried curate is always objectionable about one's house and of course it is strictly private but i thought i would tell you as it might remove unpleasantnesses <\s>
<s> but mind not one word if you please about the story <\s>
<s> pendennis said with perfect sincerity that she was exceedingly glad to hear the news and hoped mr <\s>
<s> smirke who was a very kind and amiable man would have a deserving wife and when her visitor went away helen and her brother talked of the matter with great satisfaction the kind lady rebuking herself for her haughty behaviour to mr <\s>
<s> smirke whom she had avoided of late instead of being grateful to him for his constant attention to arthur <\s>
<s> gratitude to this kind of people the major said is very well but familiarity is out of the question <\s>
<s> this gentleman gives his lessons and receives his money like any other master <\s>
<s> you are too humble my good soul <\s>
<s> there must be distinctions in ranks and that sort of thing <\s>
<s> i told you before you were too kind to mr <\s>
<s> but helen did not think so and now that arthur was going away and she bethought her how very polite mr <\s>
<s> smirke had been how he had gone on messages for her how he had brought books and copied music how he had taught laura so many things and given her so many kind presents her heart smote her on account of her ingratitude towards the curate so much so that when he came down from study with pen and was hankering about the hall previous to his departure she went out and shook hands with him with rather a blushing face and begged him to come into her drawing room where she said they now never saw him <\s>
<s> and as there was to be rather a good dinner that day she invited mr <\s>
<s> smirke to partake of it and we may be sure that he was too happy to accept such a delightful summons <\s>
<s> eased by the above report of all her former doubts and misgivings regarding the curate helen was exceedingly kind and gracious to mr <\s>
<s> smirke during dinner redoubling her attentions perhaps because major pendennis was very high and reserved with his nephew's tutor <\s>
<s> when pendennis asked smirke to drink wine he addressed him as if he was a sovereign speaking to a petty retainer in a manner so condescending that even pen laughed at it although quite ready for his part to be as conceited as most young men are <\s>
<s> but smirke did not care for the impertinences of the major so long as he had his hostess's kind behaviour and he passed a delightful time by her side at table exerting all his powers of conversation to please her talking in a manner both clerical and worldly about the fancy bazaar and the great missionary meeting about the last new novel and the bishop's excellent sermon about the fashionable parties in london an account of which he read in the newspapers in fine he neglected no art by which a college divine who has both sprightly and serious talents a taste for the genteel an irreproachable conduct and a susceptible heart will try and make himself agreeable to the person on whom he has fixed his affections <\s>
<s> major pendennis came yawning out of the dining room very soon after his sister and little laura had left the apartment <\s>
<s> what an unsufferable bore that man is and how he did talk <\s>
<s> he has been very good to arthur who is very fond of him mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis said i wonder who the miss thompson is whom he is going to marry <\s>
<s> i always thought the fellow was looking in another direction said the major <\s>
<s> pendennis quite innocently towards myra portman <\s>
<s> towards helen pendennis if you must know answered her brother in law <\s>
<s> helen said who knew perfectly well that such had been the case <\s>
<s> his marriage will be a very happy thing <\s>
<s> i hope arthur will not take too much wine <\s>
<s> now arthur flushed with a good deal of pride at the privilege of having the keys of the cellar and remembering that a very few more dinners would probably take place which he and his dear friend smirke could share had brought up a liberal supply of claret for the company's drinking and when the elders with little laura left him he and the curate began to pass the wine very freely <\s>
<s> one bottle speedily yielded up the ghost another shed more than half its blood before the two topers had been much more than half an hour together pen with a hollow laugh and voice had drunk off one bumper to the falsehood of women and had said sardonically that wine at any rate was a mistress who never deceived and was sure to give a man a welcome <\s>
<s> smirke gently said that he knew for his part some women who were all truth and tenderness and casting up his eyes towards the ceiling and heaving a sigh as if evoking some being dear and unmentionable he took up his glass and drained it and the rosy liquor began to suffuse his face <\s>
<s> pen trolled over some verses he had been making that morning in which he informed himself that the woman who had slighted his passion could not be worthy to win it that he was awaking from love's mad fever and of course under these circumstances proceeded to leave her and to quit a heartless deceiver that a name which had one day been famous in the land might again be heard in it and that though he never should be the happy and careless boy he was but a few months since or his heart be what it had been ere passion had filled it and grief had well nigh killed it that though to him personally death was as welcome as life and that he would not hesitate to part with the latter but for the love of one kind being whose happiness depended on his own yet he hoped to show he was a man worthy of his race and that one day the false one should be brought to know how great was the treasure and noble the heart which she had flung away <\s>
<s> pen we say who was a very excitable person rolled out these verses in his rich sweet voice which trembled with emotion whilst our young poet spoke <\s>
<s> he had a trick of blushing when in this excited state and his large and honest grey eyes also exhibited proofs of a sensibility so genuine hearty and manly that miss costigan if she had a heart must needs have softened towards him and very likely she was as he said altogether unworthy of the affection which he lavished upon her <\s>
<s> the sentimental smirke was caught by the emotion which agitated his young friend <\s>
<s> he grasped pen's hand over the dessert dishes and wine glasses <\s>
<s> he said the verses were beautiful that pen was a poet a great poet and likely by heaven's permission to run a great career in the world <\s>
<s> go on and prosper dear arthur he cried the wounds under which at present you suffer are only temporary and the very grief you endure will cleanse and strengthen your heart <\s>
<s> i have always prophesied the greatest and brightest things of you as soon as you have corrected some failings and weaknesses of character which at present belong to you <\s>
<s> but you will get over these my boy you will get over these and when you are famous and celebrated as i know you will be will you remember your old tutor and the happy early days of your youth <\s>

<s> i shall never forget how kind you have been to me smirke he said <\s>
<s> i don't know what i should have done without you <\s>

<s> am i really arthur <\s>
<s> said smirke looking through his spectacles and his heart began to beat so that he thought pen must almost hear it throbbing <\s>
<s> my best friend my friend for ever pen said <\s>
<s> god bless you old boy and he drank up the last glass of the second bottle of the famous wine which his father had laid in which his uncle had bought which lord levant had imported and which now like a slave indifferent was ministering pleasure to its present owner and giving its young master delectation <\s>

<s> smirke's good health hip hip hurray <\s>
<s> smirke convulsively gulped down his glass of wine and pen waved his over his head cheering so as to make his mother and laura wonder on the lawn and his uncle who was dozing over the paper in the drawing room start and say to himself that boy's drinking too much <\s>

<s> i may be insane i may be madly ambitious i may be presumptuous but for two years my heart has been filled by one image and has known no other idol <\s>
<s> haven't i loved you as a son arthur say hasn't charles smirke loved you as a son <\s>
<s> yes old boy you've been very good to me pen said whose liking however for his tutor was not by any means of the filial kind <\s>

<s> the lad felt the hint and blushed quite red <\s>
<s> the cases are not similar smirke he said and the allusion might have been spared <\s>
<s> a man may forget his own rank and elevate any woman to it but allow me to say our positions are very different <\s>
<s> how do you mean dear arthur <\s>
<s> the curate interposed sadly cowering as he felt that his sentence was about to be read <\s>
<s> i mean what i say <\s>
<s> my tutor i say my tutor has no right to ask a lady of my mother's rank of life to marry him <\s>
<s> it's a breach of confidence <\s>
<s> i say it's a liberty you take smirke it's a liberty <\s>
<s> the curate began to cry with clasped hands and a scared face but arthur gave another stamp with his foot and began to pull at the bell <\s>
<s> don't let's have any more of this <\s>
<s> we'll have some coffee if you please he said with a majestic air and the old butler entering at the summons arthur bade him to serve that refreshment <\s>
<s> john said he had just carried coffee into the drawing room where his uncle was asking for master arthur and the old man gave a glance of wonder at the three empty claret bottles <\s>
<s> smirke said he thought he'd he'd rather not go into the drawing room on which arthur haughtily said as you please and called for mr <\s>

<s> helen was still walking up and down the soft lawn as the sun was setting and the curate took off his hat and bowed by way of farewell and passed on to the door leading to the stable court by which the pair disappeared <\s>
<s> smirke knew the way to the stable as he said well enough <\s>
<s> he fumbled at the girths of the saddle which pen fastened for him and put on the bridle and led the pony into the yard <\s>

<s> smirke nodded his head silently and rode out of the lodge gate and pen looked after him for a couple of minutes until he disappeared down the road and the clatter of the pony's hoofs died away <\s>
<s> helen was still lingering on the lawn waiting until the boy came back she put his hair off his forehead and kissed it fondly <\s>

<s> come along you two people cried on major pendennis your coffee is getting quite cold <\s>
<s> when laura was gone to bed pen who was big with his secret burst out with it and described the dismal but ludicrous scene which had occurred <\s>

<s> the small account with the spirit merchant which major pendennis had settled was the chief of captain costigan's debts and though the captain at one time talked about repaying every farthing of the money it never appears that he executed his menace nor did the laws of honour in the least call upon him to accomplish that threat <\s>
<s> when miss costigan had seen all the outstanding bills paid to the uttermost shilling she handed over the balance to her father who broke out into hospitalities to all his friends gave the little creeds more apples and gingerbread than he had ever bestowed upon them so that the widow creed ever after held the memory of her lodger in veneration and the young ones wept bitterly when he went away and in a word managed the money so cleverly that it was entirely expended before many days and that he was compelled to draw upon mr <\s>

<s> costigan had been also an occasional buccaneer <\s>
<s> but a want of punctuality of payments had of late somewhat excluded him from the society where he was subject to disagreeable remarks from the landlord who said that a buccaneer who didn't pay his shot was utterly unworthy to be a marine bandit <\s>
<s> but when it became known to the ears as the clubbists called themselves familiarly that miss fotheringay had made a splendid engagement a great revolution of feeling took place in the club regarding captain costigan <\s>
<s> solly mine host of the grapes and i need not say as worthy a fellow as ever stood behind a bar told the gents in the buccaneers room one night how noble the captain had behaved having been round and paid off all his ticks in chatteris including his score of three pound fourteen here and pronounced that cos was a good feller a gentleman at bottom and he solly had always said so and finally worked upon the feelings of the buccaneers to give the captain a dinner <\s>

<s> after the enthusiastic cheering which rang through old chatteris had subsided captain costigan rose in reply and made a speech of twenty minutes in which he was repeatedly overcome by his emotions <\s>

<s> under such recommendations the tutor was of course most cordial to the young freshman and his guardian invited the latter to dine in hall where he would have the satisfaction of seeing his nephew wear his gown and eat his dinner for the first time and requested the pair to take wine at his rooms after hall and in consequence of the highly favourable report he had received of mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis said he should be happy to give him the best set of rooms to be had in college a gentleman pensioner's set indeed which were just luckily vacant <\s>

<s> pen was all in a tremor of pleasure as the bustling tailor tried on a gown and pronounced that it was an excellent fit and then he put the pretty college cap on in rather a dandified manner and somewhat on one side as he had seen fiddicombe the youngest master at grey friars wear it <\s>
<s> and he inspected the entire costume with a great deal of satisfaction in one of the great gilt mirrors which ornamented mr <\s>

<s> the major smiled as he saw the boy dandifying himself in the glass the old gentleman was not displeased with the appearance of the comely lad <\s>
<s> then davis the skip or attendant led the way keys in hand across the quadrangle the major and pen following him the latter blushing and pleased with his new academical habiliments across the quadrangle to the rooms which were destined for the freshman and which were vacated by the retreat of the gentleman pensioner mr <\s>
<s> the rooms were very comfortable with large cross beams high wainscots and small windows in deep embrasures <\s>
<s> spicer's furniture was there and to be sold at a valuation and major pendennis agreed on his nephew's behalf to take the available part of it laughingly however declining as indeed pen did for his own part six sporting prints and four groups of opera dancers with gauze draperies which formed the late occupant's pictorial collection <\s>
<s> then they went to hall where pen sate down and ate his commons with his brother freshmen and the major took his place at the high table along with the college dignitaries and other fathers or guardians of youth who had come up with their sons to oxbridge and after hall they went to mr <\s>
<s> buck's to take wine and after wine to chapel where the major sate with great gravity in the upper place having a fine view of the master in his carved throne or stall under the organ loft where that gentleman the learned doctor donne sate magnificent with his great prayer book before him an image of statuesque piety and rigid devotion <\s>
<s> all the young freshmen behaved with gravity and decorum but pen was shocked to see that atrocious little foker who came in very late and half a dozen of his comrades in the gentlemen pensioners seats giggling and talking as if they had been in so many stalls at the opera <\s>
<s> but these circumstances it must be remembered took place some years back when william the fourth was king <\s>
<s> young men are much better behaved now and besides saint boniface was rather a fast college <\s>

<s> was it about his mother at home the pious soul whose life was bound up in his <\s>
<s> yes let us hope he thought of her a little <\s>
<s> was it about miss fotheringay and his eternal passion which had kept him awake so many nights and created such wretchedness and such longing <\s>
<s> he had a trick of blushing and if you had been in the room and the candle had not been out you might have seen the youth's countenance redden more than once as he broke out into passionate incoherent exclamations regarding that luckless event of his life <\s>
<s> his uncle's lessons had not been thrown away upon him the mist of passion had passed from his eyes now and he saw her as she was <\s>
<s> to think that he pendennis had been enslaved by such a woman and then jilted by her <\s>
<s> that he should have stooped so low to be trampled on the mire <\s>
<s> that there was a time in his life and that but a few months back when he was willing to take costigan for his father in law <\s>

<s> he won't die of his passion ha ha <\s>
<s> the major had he been awake might have heard a score of such ejaculations uttered by pen as he lay awake and restless through the first night of his residence at oxbridge <\s>
<s> it would perhaps have been better for a youth the battle of whose life was going to begin on the morrow to have passed the eve in a fferent sort of vigil but the world had got hold of pen in the shape of his selfish old mentor and those who have any interest in his character must have perceived ere now that this lad was very weak as well as very impetuous very vain as well as very frank and if of a generous disposition not a little selfish in the midst of his profuseness and also rather fickle as all eager pursuers of self gratification are <\s>
<s> the six months passion had aged him very considerably <\s>
<s> there was an immense gulf between pen the victim of love and pen the innocent boy of eighteen sighing after it and so arthur pendennis had all the experience and superiority besides that command which afterwards conceit and imperiousness of disposition gave him over the young men with whom he now began to live <\s>
<s> he and his uncle passed the morning with great satisfaction in making purchases for the better comfort of the apartments which the lad was about to occupy <\s>
<s> spicer's china and glass was in a dreadfully dismantled condition his lamps smashed and his bookcases by no means so spacious as those shelves which would be requisite to receive the contents of the boxes which were lying in the hall at fairoaks and which were addressed to arthur in the hand of poor helen <\s>
<s> the boxes arrived in a few days that his mother had packed with so much care <\s>
<s> pen was touched as he read the superscriptions in the dear well known hand and he arranged in their proper places all the books his old friends and all the linen and table cloths which helen had selected from the family stock and all the jam pots which little laura had bound in straw and the hundred simple gifts of home <\s>
<s> pen had another alma mater now <\s>
<s> but it is not all children who take to her kindly <\s>
<s> pendennis of boniface our friend pen was not sorry when his mentor took leave of the young gentleman on the second day after the arrival of the pair in oxbridge and we may be sure that the major on his part was very glad to have discharged his duty and to have the duty over <\s>
<s> more than three months of precious time had that martyr of a major given up to his nephew was ever selfish man called upon to make a greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> do you know many men or majors who would do as much <\s>
<s> a man will lay down his head or peril his life for his honour but let us be shy how we ask him to give up his ease or his heart's desire <\s>
<s> very few of us can bear that trial <\s>
<s> say worthy reader if thou hast peradventure a beard wouldst thou do as much <\s>
<s> i will not say that a woman will not <\s>
<s> they are used to it we take care to accustom them to sacrifices but my good sir the amount of self denial which you have probably exerted through life when put down to your account elsewhere will not probably swell the balance on the credit side much <\s>
<s> well well there is no use in speaking of such ugly matters and you are too polite to use a vulgar to quoque <\s>
<s> but i wish to state once for all that i greatly admire the major for his conduct during the past quarter and think that he has quite a right to be pleased at getting a holiday <\s>
<s> foker and pen saw him off in the coach and the former young gentleman gave particular orders to the coachman to take care of that gentleman inside <\s>
<s> it pleased the elder pendennis to have his nephew in the company of a young fellow who would introduce him to the best set of the university <\s>
<s> the major rushed off to london and thence to cheltenham from which watering place he descended upon some neighbouring great houses whereof the families were not gone abroad and where good shooting and company was to be had <\s>
<s> a quarter of the space which custom has awarded to works styled the serial nature has been assigned to the account of one passage in pen's career and it is manifest that the whole of his adventures cannot be treated at a similar length unless some descendant of the chronicler of pen's history should take up the pen at his decease and continue the narrative for the successors of the present generation of readers <\s>
<s> we are not about to go through the young fellow's academical career with by any means a similar minuteness <\s>
<s> alas the life of such boys does not bear telling altogether <\s>
<s> i wish it did <\s>
<s> i ask you does yours <\s>
<s> as long as what we call our honour is clear i suppose your mind is pretty easy <\s>
<s> women are pure but not men <\s>
<s> women are unselfish but not men <\s>
<s> and i would not wish to say of poor arthur pendennis that he was worse than his neighbours only that his neighbours are bad for the most part <\s>
<s> let us have the candour to own as much at least <\s>
<s> can you point out ten spotless men of your acquaintance <\s>
<s> mine is pretty large but i can't find ten saints in the list <\s>
<s> during the first term of mr <\s>
<s> pen's academical life he attended classical and mathematical lectures with tolerable assiduity but discovering before very long time that he had little taste or genius for the pursuing of the exact sciences and being perhaps rather annoyed that one or two very vulgar young men who did not even use straps to their trousers so as to cover the abominably thick and coarse shoes and stockings which they wore beat him completely in the lecture room he gave up his attendance at that course and announced to his fond parent that he proposed to devote himself exclusively to the cultivation of greek and roman literature <\s>
<s> pendennis was for her part quite satisfied that her darling boy should pursue that branch of learning for which he had the greatest inclination and only besought him not to ruin his health by too much study for she had heard the most melancholy stories of young students who by over fatigue had brought on brain fevers and perished untimely in the midst of their university career <\s>
<s> and pen's health which was always delicate was to be regarded as she justly said beyond all considerations or vain honours <\s>
<s> pen although not aware of any lurking disease which was likely to end his life yet kindly promised his mamma not to sit up reading too late of nights and stuck to his word in this respect with a great deal more tenacity of resolution than he exhibited upon some other occasions when perhaps he was a little remiss <\s>
<s> presently he began too to find that he learned little good in the classical lecture <\s>
<s> his fellow students there were too dull as in mathematics they were too learned for him <\s>
<s> buck the tutor was no better a scholar than many a fifth form boy at grey friars might have some stupid humdrum notions about the metre and grammatical construction of a passage of aeschylus or aristophanes but had no more notion of the poetry than mrs <\s>
<s> binge his bed maker and pen grew weary of hearing the dull students and tutor blunder through a few lines of a play which he could read in a tenth part of the time which they gave to it <\s>
<s> after all private reading as he began to perceive was the only study which was really profitable to a man and he announced to his mamma that he should read by himself a great deal more and in public a great deal less <\s>
<s> that excellent woman knew no more about homer than she did about algebra but she was quite contented with pen's arrangements regarding his course of studies and felt perfectly confident that her dear boy would get the place which he merited <\s>
<s> pen did not come home until after christmas a little to the fond mother's disappointment and laura's who was longing for him to make a fine snow fortification such as he had made three winters before <\s>
<s> but he was invited to logwood lady agnes foker's where there were private theatricals and a gay christmas party of very fine folks some of them whom major pendennis would on no account have his nephew neglect <\s>
<s> however he stayed at home for the last three weeks of the vacation and laura had the opportunity of remarking what a quantity of fine new clothes he brought with him and his mother admired his improved appearance and manly and decided tone <\s>
<s> he did not come home at easter but when he arrived for the long vacation he brought more smart clothes appearing in the morning in wonderful shooting jackets with remarkable buttons and in the evening in gorgeous velvet waistcoats with richly embroidered cravats and curious linen <\s>
<s> and as she pried about his room she saw oh such a beautiful dressing case with silver mountings and a quantity of lovely rings and jewellery <\s>
<s> and he had a new french watch and gold chain in place of the big old chronometer with its bunch of jingling seals which had hung from the fob of john pendennis and by the second hand of which the defunct doctor had felt many a patient's pulse in his time <\s>
<s> it was but a few months back pen had longed for this watch which he thought the most splendid and august timepiece in the world and just before he went to college helen had taken it out of her trinket box where it had remained unwound since the death of her husband and given it to pen with a solemn and appropriate little speech respecting his father's virtues and the proper use of time <\s>
<s> this portly and valuable chronometer pen now pronounced to be out of date and indeed made some comparisons between it and a warming pan which laura thought disrespectful and he left the watch in a drawer in the company of soiled primrose gloves cravats which had gone out of favour and of that other school watch which has once before been mentioned in this history <\s>
<s> our old friend rebecca pen pronounced to be no long up to his weight and swapped her away for another and more powerful horse for which he had to pay rather a heavy figure <\s>
<s> pendennis gave the boy the money for the new horse and laura cried when rebecca was fetched away <\s>
<s> also pen brought a large box of cigars branded colorados afrancesados telescopios fudson oxford street or by some such strange titles and began to consume these not only about the stables and green houses where they were very good for helen's plants but in his own study of which practice his mother did not at first approve <\s>
<s> but he was at work upon a prize poem he said and could not compose without his cigar and quoted the late lamented it lord byron's lines in favour of the custom of smoking <\s>
<s> as he was smoking to such good purpose his mother could not of course refuse permission in fact the good soul coming into the room one day in the midst of pen's labours he was consulting a novel which had recently appeared for the cultivation of the light literature of his own country as well as of foreign nations became every student helen we say coming into the room and finding pen on the sofa at this work rather than disturb him went for a light box and his cigar case to his bedroom which was adjacent and actually put the cigar into his mouth and lighted the match at which he kindled it <\s>
<s> pen laughed and kissed his mother's hand as it hung fondly over the back of the sofa <\s>
<s> dear old mother he said if i were to tell you to burn the house down i think you would do it <\s>
<s> and it is very likely that mr <\s>
<s> pen was right and that the foolish woman would have done almost as much for him as he said <\s>
<s> besides the works of english light literature which this diligent student devoured he brought down boxes of the light literature of the neighbouring country of france into the leaves of which when helen dipped she read such things as caused her to open her eyes with wonder <\s>
<s> but pen showed her that it was not he who made the books though it was absolutely necessary that he should keep up his french by an acquaintance with the most celebrated writers of the day and that it was as clearly his duty to read the eminent paul de kock as to study swift or moliere <\s>
<s> pendennis yielded with a sigh of perplexity <\s>
<s> but miss laura was warned off the books both by his anxious mother and that rigid moralist mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis himself who however he might be called upon to study every branch of literature in order to form his mind and to perfect his style would by no means prescribe such a course of reading to a young lady whose business in life was very different <\s>
<s> in the course of this long vacation mr <\s>
<s> pen drank up the bin of claret which his father had laid in and of which we have heard the son remark that there was not a headache in a hogshead and this wine being exhausted he wrote for a further supply to his wine merchants messrs <\s>
<s> binney and latham of mark lane london from whom indeed old doctor portman had recommended pen to get a supply of port and sherry on going to college <\s>
<s> you will have no doubt to entertain your young friends at boniface with wine parties the honest rector had remarked to the lad <\s>
<s> they used to be customary at college in my time and i would advise you to employ an honest and respectable house in london for your small stock of wine rather than to have recourse to the oxbridge tradesmen whose liquor if i remember rightly was both deleterious in quality and exorbitant in price <\s>
<s> and the obedient young gentleman took the doctor's advice and patronised messrs <\s>
<s> binney and latham at the rector's suggestion <\s>
<s> so when he wrote orders for a stock of wine to be sent down to the cellars at fairoaks he hinted that messrs <\s>
<s> might send in his university account for wine at the same time with the fairoaks bill <\s>
<s> the poor widow was frightened at the amount <\s>
<s> but pen laughed at her old fashioned views said that the bill was moderate that everybody drank claret and champagne now and finally the widow paid feeling dimly that the expenses of her household were increasing considerably and that her narrow income would scarce suffice to meet them <\s>
<s> but they were only occasional <\s>
<s> pen merely came home for a few weeks at the vacation <\s>
<s> laura and she might pinch when he was gone <\s>
<s> in the brief time he was with them ought they not to make him happy <\s>
<s> arthur's own allowances were liberal all this time indeed much more so than those of the sons of far more wealthy men <\s>
<s> years before the thrifty and affectionate john pendennis whose darling project it had ever been to give his son a university education and those advantages of which his own father's extravagance had deprived him had begun laying by a store of money which he called arthur's education fund <\s>
<s> year after year in his book his executors found entries of sums vested as a <\s>
<s> f and during the period subsequent to her husband's decease and before pen's entry at college the widow had added sundry sums to this fund so that when arthur went up to oxbridge it reached no inconsiderable amount <\s>
<s> let him be liberally allowanced was major pendennis's maxim <\s>
<s> let him make his first entree into the world as a gentleman and take his place with men of good rank and station after giving it to him it will be his own duty to hold it <\s>
<s> there is no such bad policy as stinting a boy or putting him on a lower allowance than his fellows <\s>
<s> arthur will have to face the world and fight for himself presently <\s>
<s> meanwhile we shall have procured for him good friends gentlemanly habits and have him well backed and well trained against the time when the real struggle comes <\s>
<s> and these liberal opinions the major probably advanced both because they were just and because he was not dealing with his own money <\s>
<s> thus young pen the only son of an estated country gentleman with a good allowance and a gentlemanlike bearing and person looked to be a lad of much more consequence than he was really and was held by the oxbridge authorities tradesmen and undergraduates as quite a young buck and member of the aristocracy <\s>
<s> his manner was frank brave and perhaps a little impertinent as becomes a high spirited youth <\s>
<s> he was perfectly generous and free handed with his money which seemed pretty plentiful <\s>
<s> he loved joviality and had a good voice for a song <\s>
<s> boat racing had not risen in pen's time to the fureur which as we are given to understand it has since attained in the university and riding and tandem driving were the fashions of the ingenuous youth <\s>
<s> pen rode well to hounds appeared in pink as became a young buck and not particularly extravagant in equestrian or any other amusement yet managed to run up a fine bill at nile's the livery stable keeper and in a number of other quarters <\s>
<s> in fact this lucky young gentleman had almost every taste to a considerable degree <\s>
<s> he was very fond of books of all sorts doctor portman had taught him to like rare editions and his own taste led him to like beautiful bindings <\s>
<s> it was marvellous what tall copies and gilding and marbling and blind tooling the booksellers and binders put upon pen's bookshelves <\s>
<s> he had a very fair taste in matters of art and a keen relish for prints of a high school none of your french opera dancers or tawdry racing prints such as had delighted the simple eyes of mr <\s>
<s> spicer his predecessor but your stranges and rembrandt etchings and wilkies before the letter with which his apartments were furnished presently in the most perfect good taste as was allowed in the university where this young fellow got no small reputation <\s>
<s> we have mentioned that he exhibited a certain partiality for rings jewellery and fine raiment of all sorts and it must be owned that mr <\s>
<s> pen during his time at the university was rather a dressy man and loved to array himself in splendour <\s>
<s> he and his polite friends would dress themselves out with as much care in order to go and dine at each other's rooms as other folks would who were going to enslave a mistress <\s>
<s> they said he used to wear rings over his kid gloves which he always denies but what follies will not youth perpetrate with its own admirable gravity and simplicity <\s>

<s> he respected the man who could win such a sum of money <\s>
<s> he sighed and said it would set him all right <\s>
<s> macheath laughed and told him to drink another drop of maraschino <\s>
<s> i could tell you stories much more wonderful than that he added and so indeed the captain could have done without any further trouble than that of invention with which portion of the poetic faculty nature had copiously endowed him <\s>
<s> he laughed to scorn pen's love for miss fotheringay when he came to hear of that amour from arthur as he pretty soon did for we have said pen was not averse to telling the story now to his confidential friends and he and they were rather proud of the transaction <\s>
<s> but macheath took away all pen's conceit on this head not by demonstrating the folly of the lad's passion for an uneducated woman much his senior in years but by exposing his absurd desire of gratifying his passion in a legitimate way <\s>
<s> marry her said he you might as well marry and he named one of the most notorious actresses on the stage <\s>
<s> she hadn't a shred of a character <\s>
<s> he knew twenty men who were openly admirers of her and named them and the sums each had spent upon her <\s>
<s> i know no kind of calumny more frightful or frequent than this which takes away the character of women no men more reckless and mischievous than those who lightly use it and no kind of cowards more despicable than the people who invent these slanders <\s>
<s> is it or not a misfortune that a man himself of a candid disposition and disposed like our friend pen to blurt out the truth on all occasions begins life by believing all that is said to him <\s>
<s> would it be better for a lad to be less trustful and so less honest <\s>
<s> it requires no small experience of the world to know that a man who has no especial reason thereto is telling you lies <\s>
<s> i am not sure whether it is not best to go on being duped for a certain time <\s>
<s> at all events our honest pen had a natural credulity which enabled him to accept all statements which were made to him and he took every one of captain macheath's figments as if they had been the most unquestioned facts of history <\s>
<s> so bloundell's account about miss fotheringay pained and mortified pen exceedingly <\s>
<s> if he had been ashamed of his passion before what were his feelings regarding it now when the object of so much pure flame and adoration turned out to be only a worthless impostor an impostor detected by all but him <\s>
<s> it never occurred to pen to doubt the fact or to question whether the stories of a man who like his new friend never spoke well of any woman were likely to be true <\s>
<s> one easter vacation when pen had announced to his mother and uncle his intention not to go down but stay at oxbridge and read mr <\s>
<s> pen was nevertheless induced to take a brief visit to london in company with his friend mr <\s>
<s> they put up at a hotel in covent garden where bloundell had a tick as he called it and took the pleasures of the town very freely after the wont of young university men <\s>
<s> bloundell still belonged to a military club whither he took pen to dine once or twice the young men would drive thither in a cab trembling lest they should meet major pendennis on his beat in pall mall and here pen was introduced to a number of gallant young fellows with spurs and mustachios with whom he drank pale ale of mornings and beat the town of a night <\s>
<s> here he saw a deal of life indeed nor in his career about the theatres and singing houses which these roaring young blades frequented was he very likely to meet his guardian <\s>
<s> one night nevertheless they were very near to each other a plank only separating pen who was in the boxes of the museum theatre from the major who was in lord steyne's box along with that venerated nobleman <\s>
<s> the fotheringay was in the pride of her glory <\s>
<s> shad made a hit that is she had drawn very good houses for nearly a year had starred the provinces with great eclat had come back to shine in london with somewhat diminished lustre and now was acting with ever increasing attraction etc triumph of the good old british drama as the play bills avowed to houses in which there was plenty of room for anybody who wanted to see her <\s>
<s> it was not the first time pen had seen her since that memorable day when the two had parted in chatteris <\s>
<s> in the previous year when the town was making much of her and the press lauded her beauty pen had found a pretext for coming to london in term time and had rushed off to the theatre to see his old flame <\s>
<s> he recollected it rather than renewed it <\s>
<s> he remembered how ardently he used to be on the look out at chatteris when the speech before ophelia's or mrs <\s>
<s> haller's entrance on the stage was made by the proper actor <\s>
<s> now as the actor spoke he had a sort of feeble thrill as the house began to thunder with applause and ophelia entered with her old bow and sweeping curtsey pen felt a slight shock and blushed very much as he looked at her and could not help thinking that all the house was regarding him <\s>
<s> he hardly heard her for the first part of the play and he thought with such rage of the humiliation to which she had subjected him that he began to fancy he was jealous and in love with her still <\s>
<s> but that illusion did not last very long <\s>
<s> he ran round to the stage door of the theatre to see her if possible but he did not succeed <\s>
<s> she passed indeed under his nose with a female companion but he did not know her nor did she recognise him <\s>
<s> the next night he came in late and stayed very quietly for the afterpiece and on the third and last night of his stay in london why taglioni was going to dance at the opera taglioni <\s>
<s> and there was to be don giovanni which he admired of all things in the world so mr <\s>
<s> pen went to don giovanni and taglioni <\s>
<s> this time the illusion about her was quite gone <\s>
<s> she was not less handsome but she was not the same somehow <\s>
<s> the light was gone out of her eyes which used to flash there or pen's no longer were dazzled by it <\s>
<s> the rich voice spoke as of old yet it did not make pen's bosom thrill as formerly <\s>
<s> he thought he could recognise the brogue underneath the accents seemed to him coarse and false <\s>
<s> it annoyed him to hear the same emphasis on the same words only uttered a little louder worse than this it annoyed him to think that he should ever have mistaken that loud imitation for genius or melted at those mechanical sobs and sighs <\s>
<s> he felt that it was in another life almost that it was another man who had so madly loved her <\s>
<s> he was ashamed and bitterly humiliated and very lonely <\s>
<s> the delusion is better than the truth sometimes and fine dreams than dismal waking <\s>
<s> they went and had an uproarious supper that night and mr <\s>
<s> pen had a fine headache the next morning with which he went back to oxbridge having spent all his ready money <\s>
<s> as all this narrative is taken from pen's own confessions so that the reader may be assured of the truth of every word of it and as pen himself never had any accurate notion of the manner in which he spent his money and plunged himself in much deeper pecuniary difficulties during his luckless residence at oxbridge university it is of course impossible for me to give any accurate account of his involvements beyond that general notion of his way of life which has been sketched a few pages back <\s>
<s> he does not speak too hardly of the roguery of the university tradesmen or of those in london whom he honoured with his patronage at the outset of his career <\s>
<s> even finch the money lender to whom bloundell introduced him and with whom he had various transactions in which the young rascal's signature appeared upon stamped paper treated him according to pen's own account with forbearance and never mulcted him of more than a hundred per cent <\s>
<s> the old college cook his fervent admirer made him a private bill offered to send him in dinners up to the very last and never would have pressed his account to his dying day <\s>
<s> there was that kindness and frankness about arthur pendennis which won most people who came in contact with him and which if it rendered him an easy prey to rogues got him perhaps more goodwill than he merited from many honest men <\s>
<s> it was impossible to resist his good nature or in his worst moments not to hope for his rescue from utter ruin <\s>
<s> at the time of his full career of university pleasure he would leave the gayest party to go and sit with a sick friend <\s>
<s> he never knew the difference between small and great in the treatment of his acquaintances however much the unlucky lad's tastes which were of the sumptuous order led him to prefer good society he was only too ready to share his guinea with a poor friend and when he got money had an irresistible propensity for paying which he never could conquer through life <\s>
<s> in his third year at college the duns began to gather awfully round about him and there was a levee at his oak which scandalised the tutors and would have scared many a stouter heart <\s>
<s> with some of these he used to battle some he would bully under mr <\s>
<s> bloundell's directions who was a master in this art though he took a degree in no other and some deprecate <\s>
<s> and it is reported of him that little mary frodsham the daughter of a certain poor gilder and frame maker whom mr <\s>
<s> pen had thought fit to employ and who had made a number of beautiful frames for his fine prints coming to pendennis with a piteous tale that her father was ill with ague and that there was an execution in their house pen in an anguish of remorse rushed away pawned his grand watch and every single article of jewellery except two old gold sleeve buttons which had belonged to his father and rushed with the proceeds to frodsham's shop where with tears in his eyes and the deepest repentance and humility he asked the poor tradesman's pardon <\s>
<s> this young gentlemen is not told as an instance of pen's virtue but rather of his weakness <\s>
<s> it would have been much more virtuous to have had no prints at all <\s>
<s> he still stood for the baubles which he sold in order to pay frodsham's bill and his mother had cruelly to pinch herself in order to discharge the jeweller's account so that she was in the end the sufferer by the lad's impertinent fancies and follies <\s>
<s> we are not presenting pen to you as a hero or a model only as a lad who in the midst of a thousand vanities and weaknesses has as yet some generous impulses and is not altogether dishonest <\s>
<s> we have said it was to the scandal of mr <\s>
<s> buck the tutor that pen's extravagances became known from the manner in which he entered college the associates he kept and the introductions of doctor portman and the major buck for a long time thought that his pupil was a man of large property and wondered rather that he only wore a plain gown <\s>
<s> once on going up to london to the levee with an address from his majesty's loyal university of oxbridge buck had seen major pendennis at st <\s>
<s> james's in conversation with two knights of the garter in the carriage of one of whom the dazzled tutor saw the major whisked away after the levee <\s>
<s> he asked pen to wine the instant he came back let him off from chapels and lectures more than ever and felt perfectly sure that he was a young gentleman of large estate <\s>
<s> thus he was thunderstruck when he heard the truth and received a dismal confession from pen <\s>
<s> his university debts were large and the tutor had nothing to do and of course pen did not acquaint him with his london debts <\s>
<s> what man ever does tell all when pressed by his friends about his liabilities <\s>
<s> the tutor learned enough to know that pen was poor that he had spent a handsome almost a magnificent allowance and had raised around him such a fine crop of debts as it would be very hard work for any man to mow down for there is no plant that grows so rapidly when once it has taken root <\s>
<s> perhaps it was because she was so tender and good that pen was terrified lest his mother should know of his sins <\s>
<s> i can't bear to break it to her he said to the tutor in an agony of grief <\s>
<s> sir i've been a villain to her and he repented and he wished he had the time to come over again and he asked himself why why did his uncle insist upon the necessity of living with great people and in how much did all his grand acquaintance profit him <\s>
<s> they were not shy but pen thought they were and slunk from them during his last terms at college <\s>
<s> he was as gloomy as a death's head at parties which he avoided of his own part or to which his young friends soon ceased to invite him <\s>
<s> everybody knew that pendennis was hard up <\s>
<s> that man bloundell who could pay nobody and who was obliged to go down after three terms was his ruin the men said <\s>
<s> his melancholy figure might be seen shirking about the lonely quadrangles in his battered old cap and torn gown and he who had been the pride of the university but a year before the man whom all the young ones loved to look at was now the object of conversation at freshmen's wine parties and they spoke of him with wonder and awe <\s>
<s> at last came the degree examinations <\s>
<s> many a young man of his year whose hob nailed shoes pen had derided and whose face or coat he had caricatured many a man whom he had treated with scorn in the lecture room or crushed with his eloquence in the debating club many of his own set who had not half his brains but a little regularity and constancy of occupation took high places in the honours or passed with decent credit <\s>
<s> and where in the list was pen the superb pen the wit and dandy pen the poet and orator <\s>
<s> ah where was pen the widow's darling and sole pride <\s>
<s> let us hide our heads and shut up the page <\s>
<s> the lists came out and a dreadful rumour rushed through the university that pendennis of boniface was plucked <\s>
<s> flight after defeat everybody who has the least knowledge of heraldry and the peerage must be aware that the noble family of which as we know helen pendennis was a member bears for a crest a nest full of little pelicans pecking at the ensanguined bosom of a big maternal bird which plentifully supplies the little wretches with the nutriment on which according to the heraldic legend they are supposed to be brought up <\s>
<s> very likely female pelicans like so to bleed under the selfish little beaks of their young ones it is certain that women do <\s>
<s> there must be some sort of pleasure which we men don't understand which accompanies the pain of being scarified and indeed i believe some women would rather actually so suffer than not <\s>
<s> they like sacrificing themselves in behalf of the object which their instinct teaches them to love <\s>
<s> be it for a reckless husband a dissipated son a darling scapegrace of a brother how ready their hearts are to pour out their best treasures for the benefit of the cherished person and what a deal of this sort of enjoyment are we on one side ready to give the soft creatures <\s>
<s> there is scarce a man that reads this but has administered pleasure in this fashion to his womankind and has treated them to the luxury of forgiving him <\s>
<s> they don't mind how they live themselves but when the prodigal comes home they make a rejoicing and kill the fatted calf for him and at the very first hint that the sinner is returning the kind angels prepare their festival and mercy and forgiveness go smiling out to welcome him <\s>
<s> i hope it may be so always for all if we have only justice to look to heaven help us <\s>
<s> during the latter part of pen's residence at the university of oxbridge his uncle's partiality had greatly increased for the lad <\s>
<s> the major was proud of arthur who had high spirits frank manners a good person and high gentleman like bearing <\s>
<s> it pleased the old london bachelor to see pen walking with the young patricians of his university and he who was never known to entertain his friends and whose stinginess had passed into a sort of byword among some wags at the club who envied his many engagements and did not choose to consider his poverty was charmed to give his nephew and the young lords snug little dinners at his lodgings and to regale them with good claret and his very best bons mots and stories some of which would be injured by the repetition for the major's manner of telling them was incomparably neat and careful and others whereof the repetition would do good to nobody <\s>
<s> he paid his court to their parents through the young men and to himself as it were by their company <\s>
<s> he made more than one visit to oxbridge where the young fellows were amused by entertaining the old gentleman and gave parties and breakfasts and fetes partly to joke him and partly to do him honour <\s>
<s> he plied them with his stories <\s>
<s> he made himself juvenile and hilarious in the company of the young lords <\s>
<s> he went to hear pen at a grand debate at the union crowed and cheered and rapped his stick in chorus with the cheers of the men and was astounded at the boy's eloquence and fire <\s>
<s> he thought he had got a young pitt for a nephew <\s>
<s> he had an almost paternal fondness for pen <\s>
<s> he wrote to the lad letters with playful advice and the news of the town <\s>
<s> he bragged about arthur at his clubs and introduced him with pleasure into his conversation saying that egad the young fellows were putting the old ones to the wall that the lads who were coming up young lord plinlimmon a friend of my boy young lord magnus charters a chum of my scapegrace etc would make a greater figure in the world than even their fathers had done before them <\s>
<s> he asked permission to bring arthur to a grand fete at gaunt house saw him with ineffable satisfaction dancing with the sisters of the young noblemen before mentioned and gave himself as much trouble to procure cards of invitation for the lad to some good houses as if he had been a mamma with a daughter to marry and not an old half pay officer in a wig <\s>
<s> and he boasted everywhere of the boy's great talents and remarkable oratorical powers and of the brilliant degree he was going to take <\s>
<s> lord runnymede would take him on his embassy or the duke would bring him in for one of his boroughs he wrote over and over again to helen who for her part was too ready to believe anything that anybody chose to say in favour of her son <\s>
<s> and all this pride and affection of uncle and mother had been trampled down by pen's wicked extravagance and idleness <\s>
<s> i don't envy pen's feelings as the phrase is as he thought of what he had done <\s>
<s> he had slept and the tortoise had won the race <\s>
<s> he had marred at its outset what might have been a brilliant career <\s>
<s> he had dipped ungenerously into a generous mother's purse basely and recklessly spilt her little cruse <\s>
<s> it was a coward hand that could strike and rob a creature so tender <\s>
<s> and if pen felt the wrong which he had done to others are we to suppose that a young gentleman of his vanity did not feel still more keenly the shame he had brought upon himself <\s>
<s> let us be assured that there is no more cruel remorse than that and no groans more piteous than those of wounded self love <\s>
<s> like joel miller's friend the senior wrangler who bowed to the audience from his box at the play because he and the king happened to enter the theatre at the same time only with a fatuity by no means so agreeable to himself poor arthur pendennis felt perfectly convinced that all england would remark the absence of his name from the examination lists and talk about his misfortune <\s>
<s> his wounded tutor his many duns the skip and bed maker who waited upon him the undergraduates of his own time and the years below him whom he had patronised or scorned how could he bear to look any of them in the face now <\s>
<s> he rushed to his rooms into which he shut himself and there he penned a letter to his tutor full of thanks regards remorse and despair requesting that his name might be taken off the college books and intimating a wish and expectation that death would speedily end the woes of the disgraced arthur pendennis <\s>
<s> then he slunk out scarcely knowing whither he went but mechanically taking the unfrequented little lanes by the backs of the colleges until he cleared the university precincts and got down to the banks of the camisis river now deserted but so often alive with the boat races and the crowds of cheering gownsmen he wandered on and on until he found himself at some miles distance from oxbridge or rather was found by some acquaintances leaving that city <\s>
<s> as pen went up a hill a drizzling january rain beating in his face and his ragged gown flying behind him for he had not divested himself of his academical garments since the morning a postchaise came rattling up the road on the box of which a servant was seated whilst within or rather half out of the carriage window sate a young gentleman smoking a cigar and loudly encouraging the postboy <\s>
<s> it was our young acquaintance of baymouth mr <\s>
<s> spavin who had got his degree and was driving homewards in triumph in his yellow postchaise <\s>
<s> he caught a sight of the figure madly gesticulating as he worked up the hill and of poor pen's pale and ghastly face as the chaise whirled by him <\s>
<s> spavin to the postboy and the horses stopped in their mad career and the carriage pulled up some fifty yards before pen <\s>
<s> he presently heard his own name shouted and beheld the upper half of the body of mr <\s>
<s> spavin thrust out of the side window of the vehicle and beckoning pen vehemently towards it <\s>
<s> pen stopped hesitated nodded his head fiercely and pointed onwards as if desirous that the postillion should proceed <\s>
<s> he did not speak but his countenance must have looked very desperate for young spavin having stared at him with an expression of blank alarm jumped out of the carriage presently ran towards pen holding out his hand and grasping pen's said i say hullo old boy where are you going and what's the row now <\s>
<s> i'm going where i deserve to go said pen with an imprecation <\s>
<s> this ain't the way said mr <\s>
<s> this is the fenbury road <\s>
<s> i say pen don't take on because you are plucked <\s>
<s> it's nothing when you are used to it <\s>
<s> i've been plucked three times old boy and after the first time i didn't care <\s>
<s> glad it's over though <\s>
<s> you'll have better luck next time <\s>
<s> pen looked at his early acquaintance who had been plucked who had been rusticated who had only after repeated failures learned to read and write correctly and who in spite of all these drawbacks had attained the honour of a degree <\s>
<s> this man has passed he thought and i have failed <\s>
<s> it was almost too much for him to bear <\s>
<s> good bye spavin said he i'm very glad you are through <\s>
<s> don't let me keep you i'm in a hurry i'm going to town to night <\s>
<s> this ain't the way to town this is the fenbury road i tell you <\s>
<s> i was just going to turn back pen said <\s>
<s> all the coaches are full with the men going down spavin said <\s>
<s> you'd not get a place for a ten pound note <\s>
<s> get into my yellow i'll drop you at mudford where you have a chance of the fenbury mail <\s>
<s> i'll lend you a hat and a coat i've got lots <\s>
<s> come along jump in old boy go it leathers and in this way pen found himself in mr <\s>
<s> spavin's postchaise and rode with that gentleman as far as the ram inn at mudford fifteen miles from oxbridge where the fenbury mail changed horses and where pen got a place on to london <\s>
<s> the next day there was an immense excitement in boniface college oxbridge where for some time a rumour prevailed to the terror of pen's tutor and tradesmen that pendennis maddened at losing his degree had made away with himself a battered cap in which his name was almost discernible together with a seal bearing his crest of an eagle looking at a now extinct sun had been found three miles on the fenbury road near a mill stream and for four and twenty hours it was supposed that poor pen had flung himself into the stream until letters arrived from him bearing the london post mark <\s>
<s> the mail reached london at the dreary hour of five and he hastened to the inn at covent garden at which he was accustomed to put up where the ever wakeful porter admitted him and showed him to a bed <\s>
<s> pen looked hard at the man and wondered whether boots knew he was plucked <\s>
<s> when in bed he could not sleep there <\s>
<s> he tossed about until the appearance of the dismal london daylight when he sprang up desperately and walked off to his uncle's lodgings in bury street where the maid who was scouring the steps looked up suspiciously at him as he came with an unshaven face and yesterday's linen <\s>
<s> he thought she knew of his mishap too <\s>
<s> harthur what as appened sir <\s>
<s> morgan the valet asked who had just arranged the well brushed clothes and shiny boots at the door of his master's bedroom and was carrying in his wig to the major <\s>
<s> i want to see my uncle he cried in a ghastly voice and flung himself down on a chair <\s>
<s> morgan backed before the pale and desperate looking young man with terrified and wondering glances and disappeared in his master's apartment <\s>
<s> the major put his head out of the bedroom door as soon as he had his wig on <\s>
<s> senior wrangler double first class hay <\s>
<s> said the old gentleman i'll come directly and the head disappeared <\s>
<s> they don't know what has happened groaned pen what will they say when they know all <\s>
<s> pen had been standing with his back to the window and to such a dubious light as bury street enjoys of a foggy january morning so that his uncle could not see the expression of the young man's countenance or the looks of gloom and despair which even mr <\s>
<s> but when the major came out of his dressing room neat and radiant and preceded by faint odours from delcroix's shop from which emporium major pendennis's wig and his pocket handkerchief got their perfume he held out one of his hands to pen and was about addressing him in his cheery high toned voice when he caught sight of the boy's face at length and dropping his hand said good god <\s>
<s> pen what's the matter <\s>
<s> you'll see it in the papers at breakfast sir pen said <\s>
<s> my name isn't there sir <\s>
<s> hang it why should it be <\s>
<s> asked the major more perplexed <\s>
<s> i have lost everything sir pen groaned out my honour's gone i'm ruined irretrievably i can't go back to oxbridge <\s>
<s> screamed out the major <\s>
<s> you don't mean to say you have shown the white feather <\s>
<s> pen laughed bitterly at the word feather and repeated it <\s>
<s> no it isn't that sir <\s>
<s> i'm not afraid of being shot i wish to god anybody would <\s>
<s> i have not got my degree <\s>
<s> the major had heard of plucking but in a very vague and cursory way and concluded that it was some ceremony performed corporally upon rebellious university youth <\s>
<s> i wonder you can look me in the face after such a disgrace sir he said i wonder you submitted to it as a gentleman <\s>
<s> i couldn't help it sir <\s>
<s> i did my classical papers well enough it was those infernal mathematics which i have always neglected <\s>
<s> was it was it done in public sir <\s>
<s> asked the guardian looking pen anxiously in the face <\s>
<s> pen perceived the error under which his guardian was labouring and in the midst of his misery the blunder caused the poor wretch a faint smile and served to bring down the conversation from the tragedy key in which pen had been disposed to carry it on <\s>
<s> he explained to his uncle that he had gone in to pass his examination and failed <\s>
<s> on which the major said that though he had expected far better things of his nephew there was no great misfortune in this and no dishonour as far as he saw and that pen must try again <\s>
<s> me again at oxbridge pen thought after such a humiliation as that <\s>
<s> he felt that except he went down to burn the place he could not enter it <\s>
<s> but it was when he came to tell his uncle of his debts that the other felt surprise and anger most keenly and broke out in speeches most severe upon pen which the lad bore as best might without flinching <\s>
<s> he had determined to make a clean breast and had formed a full true and complete list of all his bills and liabilities at the university and in london <\s>
<s> they consisted of various items such as london tailor <\s>
<s> haberdasher for shirts and gloves <\s>
<s> hotel bill in london <\s>
<s> wine merchant in london <\s>
<s> all which items the reader may fill in at his pleasure such accounts have been inspected by the parents of many university youth and it appeared that mr <\s>
<s> pen's bills in all amounted to about seven hundred pounds and furthermore it was calculated that he had had more than twice that sum of ready money during his stay at oxbridge <\s>
<s> this sum he had spent and for it had to show what <\s>
<s> you need not press a man who is down sir pen said to his uncle gloomily <\s>
<s> i know very well sir how wicked and idle i have been <\s>
<s> my mother won't like to see me dishonoured sir he continued with his voice failing and i know she will pay these accounts <\s>
<s> but i shall ask her for no more money <\s>
<s> as you like sir the major said <\s>
<s> you are of age and my hands are washed of your affairs <\s>
<s> but you can't live without money and have no means of making it that i see though you have a fine talent in spending it and it is my belief that you will proceed as you have begun and ruin your mother before you are five years older good morning it is time for me to go to breakfast <\s>
<s> my engagements won't permit me to see you much during the time that you stay in london <\s>
<s> i presume that you will acquaint your mother with the news which you have just conveyed to me <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>
<s> he saw the oxbridge examination lists in the morning papers and read over the names not understanding the business with mournful accuracy <\s>
<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>
<s> he wishes the deed were done and done quickly <\s>
<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>
<s> she had the news already <\s>
<s> she had read pen's letter and it had relieved her somehow <\s>
<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> helen stirred and said yes i'm awake <\s>
<s> the truth is though she had been lying quite still and silent she had not been asleep one instant but had been looking at the night lamp in the chimney and had been thinking of pen for hours and hours <\s>
<s> then miss laura who had been acting with similar hypocrisy and lying occupied with her own thoughts as motionless as helen's brooch with pen's and laura's hair in it on the frilled white pincushion on the dressing table began to tell mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis of a notable plan which she had been forming in her busy little brains and by which all pen's embarrassments would be made to vanish in a moment and without the least trouble to anybody <\s>
<s> you know mamma this young lady said that i have been living with you for ten years during which time you have never taken any of my money and have been treating me just as if i was a charity girl <\s>
<s> now this obligation has offended me very much because i am proud and do not like to be beholden to people <\s>
<s> and as if i had gone to school only i wouldn't it must have cost me at least fifty pounds a year it is clear that i owe you fifty times ten pounds which i know you have put in the bank at chatteris for me and which doesn't belong to me a bit <\s>
<s> now to morrow we will go to chatteris and see that nice old mr <\s>
<s> rowdy with the bald head and ask him for it not for his head but for the five hundred pounds and i dare say he will send you two more which we will save and pay back and we will send the money to pen who can pay all his debts without hurting anybody and then we will live happy ever after <\s>
<s> what helen replied to this speech need not be repeated as the widow's answer was made up of a great number of incoherent ejaculations embraces and other irrelative matter <\s>
<s> but the two women slept well after that talk and when the night lamp went out with a splutter and the sun rose gloriously over the purple hills and the birds began to sing and pipe cheerfully amidst the leafless trees and glistening evergreens on fairoaks lawn helen woke too and as she looked at the sweet face of the girl sleeping beside her her lips parted with a smile blushes on her cheeks her spotless bosom heaving and falling with gentle undulations as if happy dreams were sweeping over it pen's mother felt happy and grateful beyond all power of words save such as pious women offer up to the beneficent dispenser of love and mercy in whose honour a chorus of such praises is constantly rising up all round the world <\s>
<s> although it was january and rather cold weather so sincere was mr <\s>
<s> pen's remorse and so determined his plans of economy that he would not take an inside place in the coach but sate up behind with his friend the guard who remembered his former liberality and lent him plenty of great coats <\s>
<s> perhaps it was the cold that made his knees tremble as he got down at the lodge gate or it may be that he was agitated at the notion of seeing the kind creature for whose love he had made so selfish a return <\s>
<s> old john was in waiting to receive his master's baggage but he appeared in a fustian jacket and no longer wore his livery of drab and blue <\s>
<s> i'se garner and stable man and lives in the ladge now this worthy man remarked with a grin of welcome to pen and something of a blush but instantly as pen turned the corner of the shrubbery and was out of eye shot of the coach helen made her appearance her face beaming with love and forgiveness for forgiving is what some women love best of all <\s>
<s> we may be sure that the widow having a certain other object in view had lost no time in writing off to pen an account of the noble the magnanimous the magnificent offer of laura filling up her letter with a profusion of benedictions upon both her children <\s>
<s> it was probably the knowledge of this money obligation which caused pen to blush very much when he saw laura who was in waiting in the hall and who this time and for this time only broke through the little arrangement of which we have spoken as having subsisted between her and arthur for the last few years but the truth is there has been a great deal too much said about kissing in the present chapter <\s>
<s> so the prodigal came home and the fatted calf was killed for him and he was made as happy as two simple women could make him <\s>
<s> no allusions were made to the oxbridge mishap or questions asked as to his farther proceedings for some time <\s>
<s> but pen debated these anxiously in his own mind and up in his own room where he passed much time in cogitation <\s>
<s> a few days after he came home he rode to chatteris on his horse and came back on the top of the coach <\s>
<s> he then informed his mother that he had left the horse to be sold and when that operation was effected he handed her over the cheque which she and possibly pen himself thought was an act of uncommon virtue and self denial but which laura pronounced to be only strict justice <\s>
<s> he rarely mentioned the loan which she had made and which indeed had been accepted by the widow with certain modifications but once or twice and with great hesitation and stammering he alluded to it and thanked her but it evidently pained his vanity to be beholden to the orphan for succour <\s>
<s> he was wild to find some means of repaying her <\s>
<s> he left off drinking wine and betook himself but with great moderation to the refreshment of whisky and water <\s>
<s> he gave up cigar smoking but it must be confessed that of late years he had liked pipes and tobacco as well or even better so that this sacrifice was not a very severe one <\s>
<s> he fell asleep a great deal after dinner when he joined the ladies in the drawing room and was certainly very moody and melancholy <\s>
<s> he watched the coaches with great interest walked in to read the papers at clavering assiduously dined with anybody who would ask him and the widow was glad that he should have any entertainment in their solitary place and played a good deal at cribbage with captain glanders <\s>
<s> portman who in his turn whenever pen passed gave him very severe looks from under his shovel hat <\s>
<s> he went to church with his mother however very regularly and read prayers for her at home to the little household <\s>
<s> always humble it was greatly diminished now a couple of maids did the work of the house of fairoaks the silver dish covers never saw the light at all <\s>
<s> john put on his livery to go to church and assert his dignity on sundays but it was only for form's sake <\s>
<s> he was gardener and out door man vice upton resigned <\s>
<s> there was but little fire in fairoaks kitchen and john and the maids drank their evening beer there by the light of a single candle <\s>
<s> all this was mr <\s>
<s> pen's doing and the state of things did not increas his cheerfulness <\s>
<s> for some time pen said no power on earth could induce him to go back to oxbridge again after his failure there but one day laura said to him with many blushes that she thought as some sort of reparation of punishment on himself for his for his idleness he ought to go back and get his degree if he could fetch it by doing so and so back mr <\s>
<s> a plucked man is a dismal being in a university belonging to no set of men there and owned by no one <\s>
<s> pen felt himself plucked indeed of all the fine feathers which he had won during his brilliant years and rarely appeared out of his college regularly going to morning chapel and shutting himself up in his rooms of nights away from the noise and suppers of the undergraduates <\s>
<s> there were no duns about his door they were all paid scarcely any cards were left there <\s>
<s> the men of his year had taken their degrees and were gone <\s>
<s> he went into a second examination and passed with perfect ease <\s>
<s> he was somewhat more easy in his mind when he appeared in his bachelor's gown <\s>
<s> on his way back from oxbridge he paid a visit to his uncle in london but the old gentleman received him with very cold looks and would scarcely give him his forefinger to shake <\s>
<s> he called a second time but morgan the valet said his master was from home <\s>
<s> pen came back to fairoaks and to his books and to his idleness and loneliness and despair <\s>
<s> he commenced several tragedies and wrote many copies of verses of a gloomy cast <\s>
<s> he formed plans of reading and broke them <\s>
<s> he thought about enlisting about the spanish legion about a profession <\s>
<s> he chafed against his captivity and cursed the idleness which had caused it <\s>
<s> helen said he was breaking his heart and was sad to see his prostration <\s>
<s> as soon as they could afford it he should go abroad he should go to london he should be freed from the dull society of two poor women <\s>
<s> it was dull very certainly <\s>
<s> the tender widow's habitual melancholy seemed to deepen into a sadder gloom and laura saw with alarm that the dear friend became every year more languid and weary and that her pale cheek grew more wan <\s>
<s> new faces the inmates of fairoaks were drowsily pursuing this humdrum existence while the great house upon the hill on the other side of the river brawl was shaking off the slumber in which it had lain during the lives of two generations of masters and giving extraordinary signs of renewed liveliness <\s>
<s> just about the time of pen's little mishap and when he was so absorbed in the grief occasioned by that calamity as to take no notice of events which befell persons less interesting to himself than arthur pendennis an announcement appeared in the provincial journals which caused no small sensation in the county at least and in all the towns villages halls and mansions and parsonages for many miles round clavering park <\s>

<s> what a famous room for a galop it will hold the whole shire <\s>
<s> we'll hang the morning parlour with the tapestry in your second salon in the rue de grenelle and furnish the oak room with the moyen age cabinets and the armour <\s>
<s> armour looks splendid against black oak and there's a venice glass in the quai voltaire which will suit that high mantelpiece to an inch sir <\s>
<s> the long saloon white and crimson of course the drawing room yellow satin and the little drawing room light blue with lace over hay <\s>
<s> i recollect my old governor caning me in that little room sir francis said sententiously he always hated me my old governor <\s>

<s> he settled the whole further arrangements of the house in the course of their walk through it and the promenade ended they went into the steward's room now inhabited by mrs <\s>
<s> blenkinsop and where mr <\s>
<s> tatham was sitting poring over a plan of the estate and the old housekeeper had prepared a collation in honour of her lord and master <\s>
<s> then they inspected the kitchen and stables about both of which sir francis was rather interested and captain strong was for examining the gardens but the baronet said d the gardens and that sort of thing <\s>
<s> and finally he drove away from the house as unconcernedly as he had entered it and that night the people of clavering learned that sir francis clavering had paid a visit to the park and was coming to live in the county <\s>
<s> when this fact came to be known at chatteris all the folks in the place were set in commotion high church and low church half pay captains and old maids and dowagers sporting squireens of the viciniage farmers tradesmen and factory people all the population in and round about the little place <\s>

<s> pen with some excitement <\s>
<s> pybus says there is a very pretty girl in the family arthur laura said who was as kind and thoughtful upon this point as women generally are a miss amory lady clavering's daughter by her first marriage <\s>
<s> of course you will fall in love with her as soon as she arrives <\s>
<s> helen cried out don't talk nonsense laura <\s>
<s> pen laughed and said well there is the young sir francis for you <\s>
<s> he is but four years old miss laura replied <\s>
<s> but i shall console myself with that handsome officer sir francis's friend <\s>
<s> he was at church last sunday in the clavering pew and his mustachios were beautiful <\s>
<s> indeed the number of sir francis's family whereof the members have all been mentioned in the above paragraphs was pretty soon known in his town and everything else as nearly as human industry and ingenuity could calculate regarding his household <\s>
<s> the park avenue and grounds were dotted now with town folks of the summer evenings who made their way up to the great house peered about the premises and criticised the improvements which were taking place there <\s>
<s> loads upon loads of furniture arrived in numberless vans from chatteris and london and numerous as the vans are there was not one but captain glanders knew what it contained and escorted the baggage up to the park house <\s>
<s> he and captain edward strong had formed an intimate acquaintance by this time <\s>
<s> the younger captain occupied those very lodgings at clavering which the peaceful smirke had previously tenanted and was deep in the good graces of madame fribsby his landlady and of the whole town indeed <\s>
<s> the captain was splendid in person and raiment fresh coloured blue eyed black whiskered broad chested athletic a slight tendency to fulness did not take away from the comeliness of his jolly figure a braver soldier never presented a broader chest to the enemy <\s>
<s> as he strode down clavering high street his hat on one side his cane clanking on the pavement or waving round him in the execution of military cuts and soldatesque manoeuvres his jolly laughter ringing through the otherwise silent street he was as welcome as sunshine to the place and a comfort to every inhabitant in it <\s>
<s> on the first market day he knew every pretty girl in the market he joked with all the women had a word with the farmers about their stock and dined at the agricultural ordinary at the clavering arms where he set them all dying with laughing by his fun and jokes <\s>
<s> tu be sure he be a vine veller tu be sure that he be was the universal opinion of the gentlemen in top boots <\s>
<s> he shook hands with a score of them as they rode out of the inn yard on their old nags waving his hat to them splendidly as he smoked his cigar in the inn gate <\s>
<s> in the course of the evening he was free of the landlady's bar knew what rent the landlord paid how many acres he farmed how much malt he put in his strong beer and whether he ever ran in a little brandy unexcised by kings from baymouth or the fishing villages along the coast <\s>
<s> he had tried to live at the great house first but it was so dull he couldn't stand it <\s>
<s> i am a creature born for society he told captain glanders <\s>
<s> i'm down here to see clavering's house set in order for between ourselves frank has no energy sir no energy he's not the chest for it sir and he threw out his own trunk as he spoke ); but i must have social intercourse <\s>
<s> blenkinsop goes to bed at seven and takes polly with her <\s>
<s> there was nobody but me and the ghost for the first two nights at the great house and i own it sir i like company <\s>
<s> most old soldiers do <\s>
<s> glanders asked strong where he had served <\s>
<s> captain strong curled his mustache and said with a laugh that the other might almost ask where he had not served <\s>
<s> i began sir as cadet of hungarian uhlans and when the war of greek independence broke out quitted that service in consequence of a quarrel with my governor and was one of seven who escaped from missolonghi and was blown up in one of botzaris's fireships at the age of seventeen <\s>
<s> i'll show you my cross of the redeemer if you'll come over to my lodgings and take a glass of grog with me captain this evening <\s>
<s> i've a few of those baubles in my desk <\s>
<s> i've the white eagle of poland skrzynecki gave it me he pronounced skrzynecki's name with wonderful accuracy and gusto upon the field of ostrolenka <\s>
<s> i was a lieutenant of the fourth regiment sir and we marched through diebitsch's lines bang thro em into prussia sir without firing a shot <\s>
<s> ah captain that was a mismanaged business <\s>
<s> i received this wound by the side of the king before oporto where he would have pounded the stock jobbing pedroites had bourmont followed my advice and i served in spain with the king's troops until the death of my dear friend zumalacarreguy when i saw the game was over and hung up my toasting iron captain <\s>
<s> alava offered me a regiment the queen's muleteros but i couldn't damme i couldn't and now sir you know ned strong the chevalier strong they call me abroad as well as he knows himself <\s>
<s> in this way almost everybody in clavering came to know ned strong <\s>
<s> he told madame fribsby he told the landlord of the george he told baker at the reading rooms he told mrs <\s>
<s> glanders and the young ones at dinner and finally he told mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis who yawning into clavering one day found the chevalier strong in company with captain glanders and who was delighted with his new acquaintance <\s>
<s> before many days were over captain strong was as much at home in helen's drawing room as he was in madame fribsby's first floor and made the lonely house very gay with his good humour and ceaseless flow of talk <\s>
<s> the two women had never before seen such a man <\s>
<s> he had a thousand stories about battles and dangers to interest them about greek captives polish beauties and spanish nuns <\s>
<s> he could sing scores of songs in half a dozen languages and would sit down to the piano and troll them off in a rich manly voice <\s>
<s> both the ladies pronounced him to be delightful and so he was though indeed they had not had much choice of man's society as yet having seen in the course of their lives but few persons except old portman and the major and mr <\s>
<s> pen who was a genius to be sure but then your geniuses are somewhat flat and moody at home <\s>
<s> and captain strong acquainted his new friends at fairoaks not only with his own biography but with the whole history of the family now coming to clavering <\s>
<s> it was he who had made the marriage between his friend frank and the widow amory <\s>
<s> she wanted rank and he wanted money <\s>
<s> what match could be more suitable <\s>
<s> he organised it he made those two people happy <\s>
<s> there was no particular romantic attachment between them the widow was not of an age or a person for romance and sir francis if he had his game at billiards and his dinner cared for little besides <\s>
<s> but they were as happy as people could be <\s>
<s> clavering would return to his native place and country his wife's fortune would pay his encumbrances off and his son and heir would be one of the first men in the county <\s>
<s> laura was uncommonly curious about miss amory <\s>
<s> oh miss amory is a muse miss amory is a mystery miss amory is a femme incomprise <\s>
<s> pendennis but the chevalier gave her no answer perhaps could not give her one <\s>
<s> miss amory paints miss amory writes poems miss amory composes music miss amory rides like diana vernon <\s>
<s> miss amory is a paragon in a word <\s>
<s> i hate clever women said pen <\s>
<s> thank you said laura <\s>
<s> for her part she was sure she should be charmed with miss amory and quite longed to have such a friend <\s>
<s> and with this she looked pen full in the face as if every word the little hypocrite said was gospel truth <\s>
<s> thus an intimacy was arranged and prepared beforehand between the fairoaks family and their wealthy neighbours at the park and pen and laura were to the full as eager for their arrival as even the most curious of the clavering folks <\s>
<s> a londoner who sees fresh faces and yawns at them every day may smile at the eagerness with which country people expect a visitor <\s>
<s> a cockney comes amongst them and is remembered by his rural entertainers for years after he has left them and forgotten them very likely floated far away from them on the vast london sea <\s>
<s> but the islanders remember long after the mariner has sailed away and can tell you what he said and what he wore and how he looked and how he laughed <\s>
<s> in fine a new arrival is an event in the country not to be understood by us who don't and had rather not know who lives next door <\s>
<s> when the painters and upholsterers had done their work in the house and so beautified it under captain strong's superintendence that he might well be proud of his taste that gentleman announced that he should go to london where the whole family had arrived by this time and should speedily return to establish them in their renovated mansion <\s>
<s> detachments of domestics preceded them <\s>
<s> carriages came down by sea and were brought over from baymouth by horses which had previously arrived under the care of grooms and coachmen <\s>
<s> one day the alacrity coach brought down on its roof two large and melancholy men who were dropped at the park lodge with their trunks and who were messieurs frederic and james metropolitan footmen who had no objection to the country and brought with them state and other suits of the clavering uniform <\s>
<s> on another day the mail deposited at the gate a foreign gentleman adorned with many ringlets and chains <\s>
<s> he made a great riot at the lodge gate to the keeper's wife who being a west country woman did not understand his english or his gascon french because there was no carriage in waiting to drive him to the house a mile off and because he could not walk entire leagues in his fatigued state and varnished boots <\s>
<s> this was monsieur alcide mirobolant formerly chef of his highness the duc de borodino of h <\s>
<s> eminence cardinal beccafico and at present chef of the bouche of sir clavering baronet monsieur mirobolant's library pictures and piano had arrived previously in charge of the intelligent young englishman his aide de camp <\s>
<s> he was moreover aided by a professed female cook likewise from london who had inferior females under her orders <\s>
<s> he did not dine in the steward's room but took his nutriment in solitude in his own apartments where a female servant was affected to his private use <\s>
<s> it was a grand sight to behold him in his dressing gown composing a menu <\s>
<s> he always sate down and played the piano for some time before that <\s>
<s> if interrupted he remonstrated pathetically with his little maid <\s>
<s> every great artist he said had need of solitude to perfectionate his works <\s>
<s> but we are advancing matters in the fulness of our love and respect for monsieur mirobolant and bringing him prematurely on the stage <\s>
<s> the chevalier strong had a hand in the engagement of all the london domestics and indeed seemed to be the master of the house <\s>
<s> there were those among them who said he was the house steward only he dined with the family <\s>
<s> howbeit he knew how to make himself respected and two of by no means the least comfortable rooms of the house were assigned to his particular use <\s>
<s> he was walking upon the terrace finally upon the eventful day when amidst an immense jangling of bells from clavering church where the flag was flying an open carriage and one of those travelling chariots or family arks which only english philoprogenitiveness could invent drove rapidly with foaming horses through the park gates and up to the steps of the hall <\s>
<s> the two battans of the sculptured door flew open <\s>
<s> the superior officers in black the large and melancholy gentlemen now in livery with their hair in powder the country menials engaged to aid them were in waiting in the hall and bowed like elms when autumn winds wail in the park <\s>
<s> through this avenue passed sir francis clavering with a most unmoved face lady clavering with a pair of bright black eyes and a good humoured countenance which waggled and nodded very graciously master francis clavering who was holding his mamma's skirt and who stopped the procession to look at the largest footman whose appearance seemed to strike the young gentleman and miss blandy governess to master francis and miss amory her ladyship's daughter giving her arm to captain strong <\s>
<s> it was summer but fires of welcome were crackling in the great hall chimney and in the rooms which the family were to occupy <\s>
<s> monsieur mirobolant had looked at the procession from one of the lime trees in the avenue <\s>
<s> elle est la he said laying his jewelled hand on his richly embroidered velvet glass buttons je t'ai vue je te benis o ma sylphide o mon ange <\s>
<s> and he dived into the thicket and made his way back to his furnaces and saucepans <\s>
<s> the next sunday the same party which had just made its appearance at clavering park came and publicly took possession of the ancient pew in the church where so many of the baronet's ancestors had prayed and were now kneeling in effigy <\s>
<s> there was such a run to see the new folks that the low church was deserted to the disgust of its pastor and as the state barouche with the greys and coachman in silver wig and solemn footmen drew up at the old churchyard gate there was such a crowd assembled there as had not been seen for many a long day <\s>
<s> captain strong knew everybody and saluted for all the company the country people vowed my lady was not handsome to be sure but pronounced her to be uncommon fine dressed as indeed she was with the finest of shawls the finest of pelisses the brilliantest of bonnets and wreaths and a power of rings cameos brooches chains bangles and other nameless gimcracks and ribbons of every breadth and colour of the rainbow flaming on her person <\s>
<s> miss amory appeared meek in dove colour like a vestal virgin while master francis was in the costume then prevalent of rob roy macgregor a celebrated highland outlaw <\s>
<s> the baronet was not more animated than ordinarily there was a happy vacuity about him which enabled him to face a dinner a death a church a marriage with the same indifferent ease <\s>
<s> a pew for the clavering servants was filled by these domestics and the enraptured congregation saw the gentlemen from london with vlower on their heeds and the miraculous coachman with his silver wig take their places in that pew so soon as his horses were put up at the clavering arms <\s>
<s> in the course of the service master francis began to make such a yelling in the pew that frederic the tallest of the footmen was beckoned by his master and rose and went and carried out master francis who roared and beat him on the head so that the powder flew round about like clouds of incense <\s>
<s> nor was he pacified until placed on the box of the carriage where he played at horses with john's whip <\s>
<s> you see the little beggar's never been to church before miss bell the baronet drawled out to a young lady who was visiting him no wonder he should make a row i don't go in town neither but i think it's right in the country to give a good example and that sort of thing <\s>
<s> miss bell laughed and said the little boy had not given a particularly good example <\s>
<s> gad i don't know and that sort of thing said the baronet <\s>
<s> it ain't so bad neither <\s>
<s> whenever he wants a thing frank always cwies and whenever he cwies he gets it <\s>
<s> here the child in question began to howl for a dish of sweetmeats on the luncheon table and making a lunge across the table cloth upset a glass of wine over the best waistcoat of one of the guests present mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis who was greatly annoyed at being made to look foolish and at having his spotless cambric shirt front blotched with wine <\s>

<s> mamma says she spoils my brother do you think anything could miss bell <\s>

<s> gad i was quite wight said the baronet <\s>

<s> yes il a de beaux yeux <\s>
<s> je n'aime pas les blonds ordinairement <\s>
<s> car je suis blonde moi je suis blanche et blonde and she looked at her face and made a moue in the glass and never stopped for laura's answer to the questions which she had put <\s>
<s> blanche was fair and like a sylph <\s>
<s> she had fair hair with green reflections in it <\s>
<s> but she had dark eyebrows <\s>
<s> she had long black eyelashes which veiled beautiful brown eyes <\s>
<s> she had such a slim waist that it was a wonder to behold and such a slim little feet that you would have thought the grass would hardly bend under them <\s>
<s> her lips were of the colour of faint rosebuds and her voice warbled limpidly over a set of the sweetest little pearly teeth ever seen <\s>
<s> she showed them very often for they were very pretty <\s>
<s> she was very good natured and a smile not only showed her teeth wonderfully but likewise exhibited two lovely little pink dimples that nestled in either cheek <\s>
<s> she showed laura her drawings which the other thought charming <\s>
<s> she played her some of her waltzes with a rapid and brilliant finger and laura was still more charmed <\s>
<s> and she then read her some poems in french and english likewise of her own composition and which she kept locked in her own book her own dear little book it was bound in blue velvet with a gilt lock and on it was printed in gold the title of mes larmes <\s>
<s> mes larmes isn't it a pretty name <\s>
<s> the young lady continued who was pleased with everything that she did and did everything very well <\s>
<s> laura owned that it was <\s>
<s> she had never seen anything like it before anything so lovely so accomplished so fragile and pretty warbling so prettily and tripping about such a pretty room with such a number of pretty books pictures flowers round about her <\s>
<s> the honest and generous country girl forgot even jealousy in her admiration <\s>
<s> indeed blanche she said everything in the room is pretty and you are the prettiest of all <\s>
<s> the other smiled looked in the glass went up and took both of laura's hands and kissed them and sat down to the piano and shook out a little song as if she had been a nightingale <\s>
<s> this was the first visit paid by fairoaks to clavering park in return for clavering park's visit to fairoaks in reply to fairoaks's cards left a few days after the arrival of sir francis's family <\s>
<s> the intimacy between the young ladies sprang up like jack's bean stalk to the skies in a single night <\s>
<s> the large footmen were perpetually walking with little rose coloured pink notes to fairoaks where there was a pretty house maid in the kitchen who might possibly tempt those gentlemen to so humble a place <\s>
<s> miss amory sent music or miss amory sent a new novel or a picture from the journal des modes to laura or my lady's compliments arrived with flowers and fruit or miss amory begged and prayed miss bell to come to dinner and dear mrs <\s>

<s> arthur if a humdrum party were not too stupid for him and would send a pony carriage for mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis and would take no denial <\s>

<s> and helen who was indeed somewhat ailing was glad that the two should have their pleasure and would look at them fondly as they set forth and ask in her heart that she might not be called away until those two beings whom she loved best in the world should be joined together <\s>
<s> as they went out and crossed over the bridge she remembered summer evenings five and twenty years ago when she too had bloomed in her brief prime of love and happiness <\s>

<s> blanche vowed that she raffoled of laura and very likely mr <\s>
<s> pen was pleased with blanche <\s>
<s> his spirits came back he laughed and rattled till laura wondered to hear him <\s>
<s> it was not the same pen yawning in a shooting jacket in the fairoaks parlour who appeared alert and brisk and smiling and well dressed in lady clavering's drawing room <\s>
<s> sometimes they had music <\s>
<s> laura had a sweet contralto voice and sang with blanche who had had the best continental instruction and was charmed to be her friend's mistress <\s>

<s> sometimes they had glees when captain strong's chest was of vast service and he boomed out in a prodigious bass of which he was not a little proud <\s>
<s> good fellow strong ain't he miss bell <\s>
<s> sir francis would say to her <\s>
<s> plays at ecarte with lady clavering plays anything pitch and toss pianoforty cwibbage if you like <\s>
<s> how long do you think he's been staying with me <\s>
<s> he came for a week with a carpet bag and gad he's been staying here thwee years <\s>
<s> good fellow ain't he <\s>
<s> don't know how he gets a shillin though begad i don't miss lauwa <\s>
<s> and yet the chevalier if he lost his money to lady clavering always paid it and if he lived with his friend for three years paid for that too in good humour in kindness and joviality in a thousand little services by which he made himself agreeable <\s>
<s> what gentleman could want a better friend than a man who was always in spirits never in the way or out of it and was ready to execute any commission for his patron whether it was to sing a song or meet a lawyer to fight a duel or to carve a capon <\s>
<s> although laura and pen commonly went to clavering park together yet sometimes mr <\s>
<s> pen took walks there unattended by her and about which he did not tell her <\s>
<s> he took to fishing the brawl which runs through the park and passes not very far from the garden wall <\s>
<s> and by the oddest coincidence miss amory would walk out having been to look at her flowers and would be quite surprised to see mr <\s>
<s> i wonder what trout pen caught while the young lady was looking on <\s>
<s> or whether miss blanche was the pretty little fish which played round his fly and which mr <\s>
<s> pen was endeavouring to hook <\s>
<s> it must be owned he became very fond of that healthful and invigorating pursuit of angling and was whipping the brawl continually with his fly <\s>
<s> as for miss blanche she had a kind heart and having as she owned herself suffered a good deal in the course of her brief life and experience why she could compassionate other susceptible beings like pen who had suffered too <\s>

<s> she played with laura she read french and german with laura and mr <\s>
<s> pen read french and german along with them <\s>
<s> he turned sentimental ballads of schiller and goethe into english verse for the ladies and blanche unlocked mes larmes for him and imparted to him some of the plaintive outpourings of her own tender muse <\s>
<s> it appeared from these poems that this young creature had indeed suffered prodigiously <\s>
<s> she was familiar with the idea of suicide <\s>
<s> death she repeatedly longed for <\s>
<s> a faded rose inspired her with such grief that you would have thought she must die in pain of it <\s>
<s> it was a wonder how a young creature who had had a snug home or been at a comfortable boarding school and had no outward grief or hardship to complain of should have suffered so much should have found the means of getting at such an ocean of despair and passion as a runaway boy who will get to sea and having embarked on it should survive it <\s>
<s> what a talent she must have had for weeping to be able to pour out so many of mes larmes <\s>
<s> they were not particularly briny miss blanche's tears that is the truth but pen who read her verses thought them very well for a lady and wrote some verses himself for her <\s>
<s> his were very violent and passionate very hot sweet and strong and he not only wrote verses but o the villain <\s>
<s> he altered and adapted former poems in his possession and which had been composed for a certain emily fotheringay for the use and to the christian name of miss blanche amory <\s>
<s> a little innocent every house has its skeleton in it somewhere and it may be a comfort to some unhappy folks to think that the luckier and most wealthy of their neighbours have their miseries and causes of disquiet <\s>
<s> our little innocent muse of blanche who sang so nicely and talked so sweetly you would have thought she must have made sunshine where ever she went was the skeleton or the misery or the bore or the nemesis of clavering house and of most of the inhabitants thereof <\s>
<s> as one little stone in your own shoe or your horse's suffices to put either to torture and to make your journey miserable so in life a little obstacle is sufficient to obstruct your entire progress and subject you to endless annoyance and disquiet <\s>
<s> who would have guessed that such a smiling little fairy as blanche amory could be the cause of discord in any family <\s>
<s> i say strong one day the baronet said as the pair were conversing after dinner over the billiard table and that great unbosomer of secrets a cigar i say strong i wish to the doose your wife was dead <\s>

<s> why what has she been at now <\s>
<s> nothing particular answered sir francis only her old tricks <\s>
<s> that girl has such a knack of making everybody miserable that hang me it's quite surprising <\s>
<s> last night she sent the governess crying away from the dinner table <\s>
<s> afterwards as i was passing frank's room i heard the poor little beggar howling in the dark and found his sister had been frightening his soul out of his body by telling him stories about the ghost that's in the house <\s>

<s> she got some picture out of the keepsake and said she was sure it was like her dear father she wanted to know where her father's grave was <\s>
<s> whenever miss amory talks about him lady clavering always bursts out crying and the little devil will talk about him in order to spite her mother <\s>
<s> today when she began i got in a confounded rage said i was her father and and that sort of thing and then sir she took a shy at me <\s>
<s> and what did she say about you frank <\s>
<s> strong still laughing inquired of his friend and patron <\s>
<s> gad she said i wasn't her father that i wasn't fit to comprehend her that her father must have been a man of genius and fine feelings and that sort of thing whereas i had married her mother for money <\s>
<s> it don't make it any the pleasanter to hear because it's true don't you know sir francis clavering answered <\s>
<s> i ain't a literary man and that but i ain't such a fool as she makes me out <\s>
<s> i don't know how it is but she always manages to put me in the hole don't you understand <\s>
<s> she turns all the house round her in her quiet way and with her confounded sentimental airs <\s>
<s> i wish she was dead ned <\s>
<s> it was my wife whom you wanted dead just now strong said always in perfect good humour upon which the baron with his accustomed candour said well when people bore my life out i do wish they were dead and i wish missy were down a well with all my heart <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen from the above report of this candid conversation that our accomplished little friend had some peculiarities or defects of character which rendered her not very popular <\s>
<s> she was a young lady of some genius exquisite sympathies and considerable literary attainments living like many another genius with relatives who could not comprehend her <\s>
<s> neither her mother nor her stepfather were persons of a literary turn <\s>
<s> bell's life and the racing calendar were the extent of the baronet's reading and lady clavering still wrote like a schoolgirl of thirteen and with an extraordinary disregard to grammar and spelling <\s>
<s> and as miss amory felt very keenly that she was not appreciated and that she lived with persons who were not her equals in intellect or conversational power she lost no opportunity to acquaint her family circle with their inferiority to herself and not only was a martyr but took care to let everybody know that she was so <\s>
<s> if she suffered as she said and thought she did severely are we to wonder that a young creature of such delicate sensibilities should shriek and cry out a good deal <\s>
<s> without sympathy life is nothing and would it not have been a want of candour on her part to affect a cheerfulness which she did not feel or pretend a respect for those towards whom it was quite impossible she should entertain any reverence <\s>
<s> if a poetess may not bemoan her lot of what earthly use is her lyre <\s>
<s> blanche struck hers only to the saddest of tunes and sang elegies over her dead hopes dirges over her early frost nipt buds of affection as became such a melancholy fate and muse <\s>
<s> her actual distresses as we have said had not been up to the present time very considerable but her griefs lay like those of most of us in her own soul that being sad and habitually dissatisfied what wonder that she should weep <\s>
<s> so mes larmes dribbled out of her eyes any day at command she could furnish an unlimited supply of tears and her faculty of shedding them increased by practice <\s>
<s> for sentiment is like another complaint mentioned by horace as increasing by self indulgence i am sorry to say ladies that the complaint in question is called the dropsy and the more you cry the more you will be able and desirous to do so <\s>
<s> missy had begun to gush at a very early age <\s>
<s> lamartine was her favourite bard from the period when she first could feel and she had subsequently improved her mind by a sedulous study of novels of the great modern authors of the french language <\s>
<s> there was not a romance of balzac and george sand which the indefatigable little creature had not devoured by the time she was sixteen and however little she sympathised with her relatives at home she had friends as she said in the spirit world meaning the tender indiana the passionate and poetic lelia the amiable trenmor that high souled convict that angel of the galleys the fiery stenio and the other numberless heroes of the french romances <\s>
<s> she had been in love with prince rodolph and prince djalma while she was yet at school and had settled the divorce question and the rights of woman with indiana before she had left off pinafores <\s>
<s> the impetuous little lady played at love with these imaginary worthies as a little while before she had played at maternity with her doll <\s>
<s> pretty little poetical spirits <\s>
<s> it is curious to watch them with those playthings <\s>
<s> to day the blue eyed one is the favourite and the black eyed one is pushed behind the drawers <\s>
<s> to morrow blue eyes may take its turn of neglect and it may be an odious little wretch with a burnt nose or torn bead of hair and no eyes at all that takes the first place in miss's affection and is dandled and caressed in her arms <\s>
<s> as novelists are supposed to know everything even the secrets of female hearts which the owners themselves do not perhaps know we may state that at eleven years of age mademoiselle betsi as miss amory was then called had felt tender emotions towards a young savoyard organ grinder at paris whom she persisted in believing to be a prince carried off from his parents that at twelve an old and hideous drawing master but ah what age or personal defects are proof against woman's love had agitated her young heart and that at thirteen being at madame de caramel's boarding school in the champs elysees which as everybody knows is next door to monsieur rogron's chevalier of the legion of honour pension for young gentlemen a correspondence by letter took place between the seduisante miss betsi and two young gentlemen of the college of charlemagne who were pensioners of the chevalier rogron <\s>
<s> in the above paragraph our young friend has been called by a christian name different to that under which we were lately presented to her <\s>
<s> the fact is that miss amory called missy at home had really at the first been christened betsy but assumed the name of blanche of her own will and fantasy and crowned herself with it and the weapon which the baronet her stepfather held in terror over her was the threat to call her publicly by her name of betsy by which menace he sometimes managed to keep the young rebel in order <\s>
<s> we have spoken just now of children's dolls and of the manner in which those little people take up and neglect their darling toys and very likely this history will show that miss blanche assumed and put away her live dolls with a similar girlish inconstancy <\s>
<s> she had had hosts of dear dear darling friends ere now and had quite a little museum of locks of hair in her treasure chest which she had gathered in the course of her sentimental progress <\s>
<s> some dear friends had married some had gone to other schools one beloved sister she had lost from the pension and found again o horror <\s>
<s> her darling her leocadie keeping the books in her father's shop a grocer in the rue du bac in fact she had met with a number of disappointments estrangements disillusionments as she called them in her pretty french jargon and had seen and suffered a great deal for so young a woman <\s>
<s> but it is the lot of sensibility to suffer and of confiding tenderness to be deceived and she felt that she was only undergoing the penalties of genius in these pangs and disappointments of her young career <\s>
<s> meanwhile she managed to make the honest lady her mother as uncomfortable as circumstances would permit and caused her worthy stepfather to wish she was dead <\s>
<s> with the exception of captain strong whose invincible good humour was proof against her sarcasms the little lady ruled the whole house with he tongue <\s>
<s> if lady clavering talked about sparrowgrass instead of asparagus or called an object a hobject as this unfortunate lady would sometimes do missy calmly corrected her and frightened the good soul her mother into errors only the more frequent as she grew more nervous under her daughter's eye <\s>
<s> it is not to be supposed considering the vast interest which the arrival of the family at clavering park inspired in the inhabitants of the little town that madame fribsby alone of all the folks in clavering should have remained unmoved and incurious <\s>
<s> at the first appearance of the park family in church madame noted every article of toilette which the ladies wore from their bonnets to their brodequins and took a survey of the attire of the ladies maids in the pew allotted to them <\s>
<s> we fear that doctor portman's sermon though it was one of his oldest and most valued compositions had little effect upon madame fribsby on that day <\s>
<s> in a very few days afterwards she had managed for herself an interview with lady clavering's confidential attendant in the housekeeper's room at the park and her cards in french and english stating that she received the newest fashions from paris from her correspondent madame victorine and that she was in the custom of making court and ball dresses for the nobility and gentry of the shire were in the possession of lady clavering and miss amory and favourably received as she was happy to hear by those ladies <\s>
<s> bonner lady clavering's lady became soon a great frequenter of madame fribsby's drawing room and partook of many entertainments at the milliner's expense <\s>
<s> a meal of green tea scandal hot sally lunn cakes and a little novel reading were always at the service of mrs <\s>
<s> bonner whenever she was free to pass an evening in the town <\s>
<s> and she found much more time for these pleasures than her junior officer miss amory's maid who seldom could be spared for a holiday and was worked as hard as any factory girl by that inexorable little muse her mistress <\s>
<s> the muse loved to be dressed becomingly and having a lively fancy and a poetic desire for change was for altering her attire every day <\s>
<s> her maid having a taste in dressmaking to which art she had been an apprentice at paris before she entered into miss blanche's service there was kept from morning till night altering and remodelling miss amory's habiliments and rose very early and went to bed very late in obedience to the untiring caprices of her little taskmistress <\s>
<s> the girl was of respectable english parents <\s>
<s> there are many of our people colonists of paris who have seen better days who are not quite ruined who do not quite live upon charity and yet cannot get on without it and as her father was a cripple incapable of work and her return home would only increase the burthen and add to the misery of the family poor pincott was fain to stay where she could maintain herself and spare a little relief to her parents <\s>
<s> our muse with the candour which distinguished her never failed to remind her attendant of the real state of matters <\s>
<s> i should send you away pincott for you are a great deal too weak and your eyes are failing you and you are always crying and snivelling and wanting the doctor but i wish that your parents at home should be supported and i go on enduring you for their sake mind the dear blanche would say to her timid little attendant <\s>
<s> or pincott your wretched appearance and slavish manner and red eyes positively give me the migraine and i think i shall make you wear rouge so that you may look a little cheerful or pincott i can't bear even for the sake of your starving parents that you should tear my hair out of my head in that manner and i will thank you to write to them and say that i dispense with your services <\s>
<s> after which sort of speeches and after keeping her for an hour trembling over her hair which the young lady loved to have combed as she perused one of her favourite french novels she would go to bed at one o'clock and say pincott you may kiss me <\s>
<s> i should like you to have the pink dress ready for the morning <\s>
<s> and so with blessing upon her attendant she would turn round and go to sleep <\s>
<s> the muse might lie in bed as long as she chose of a morning and availed herself of that privilege but pincott had to rise very early indeed to get her mistress's task done and had to appear next day with the same red eyes and the same wan face which displeased miss amory by their want of gaiety and caused the mistress to be so angry because the servant persisted in being and looking unwell and unhappy <\s>
<s> not that blanche ever thought she was a hard mistress <\s>
<s> indeed she made quite a friend of pincott at times and wrote some very pretty verses about the lonely little tiring maid whose heart was far away <\s>
<s> our beloved blanche was a superior being and expected to be waited upon as such <\s>
<s> and i do not know whether there are any other ladies in this world who treat their servants or dependants so but it may be that there are such and that the tyranny which they exercise over their subordinates and the pangs which they can manage to inflict with a soft voice and a well bred simper are as cruel as those which a slave driver administers with an oath and a whip <\s>
<s> but blanche was a muse a delicate little creature quite tremulous with excitability whose eyes filled with tears at the smallest emotion and who knows but that it was the very fineness of her feelings which caused them to be froissed so easily <\s>
<s> you crush a butterfly by merely touching it <\s>
<s> vulgar people have no idea of the sensibility of a muse <\s>
<s> so little pincott being occupied all day and night in stitching hemming ripping combing ironing crimping for her mistress reading to her when in bed for the girl was mistress of the two languages and had a sweet voice and manner could take no share in madame fribsby's soirees nor indeed was she much missed or considered of sufficient consequence to appear at their entertainments <\s>
<s> but there was another person connected with the clavering establishment who became a constant guest of our friend the milliner <\s>
<s> this was the chief of the kitchen monsieur mirobolant with whom madame fribsby soon formed an intimacy <\s>
<s> not having been accustomed to the appearance or society of persons of the french nation the rustic inhabitants of clavering were not so favourably impressed by monsieur alcide's manners and appearance as that gentleman might have desired that they should be <\s>
<s> he walked among them quite unsuspiciously upon the afternoon of a summer day when his services were not required at the house in his usual favourite costume namely his light green frock or paletot his crimson velvet waistcoat with blue glass buttons his pantalon ecossais of a very large and decided check pattern his orange satin neckcloth and his jean boots with tips of shiny leather these with a gold embroidered cap and a richly gilt cane or other varieties of ornament of a similar tendency formed his usual holiday costume in which he flattered himself there was nothing remarkable unless indeed the beauty of his person should attract observation and in which he considered that he exhibited the appearance of a gentleman of good parisian ton <\s>
<s> he walked then down the street grinning and ogling every woman he met with glances which he meant should kill them outright and peered over the railings and in at the windows where females were in the tranquil summer evening <\s>
<s> pybus's maid shrank back with a lor bless us as alcide ogled her over the laurel bush the miss bakers and their mamma stared with wonder and presently a crowd began to follow the interesting foreigner of ragged urchins and children who left their dirt pies in the street to pursue him <\s>
<s> for some time he thought that admiration was the cause which led these persons in his wake and walked on pleased himself that he could so easily confer on others so much harmless pleasure <\s>
<s> but the little children and dirt pie manufacturers were presently succeeded by followers of a larger growth and a number of lads and girls from the factory being let loose at this hour joined the mob and began laughing jeering hooting and calling opprobrious names at the frenchman <\s>
<s> some cried out frenchy <\s>
<s> one asked for a lock of his hair which was long and in richly flowing ringlets and at length the poor artist began to perceive that he was an object of derision rather than of respect to the rude grinning mob <\s>
<s> it was at this juncture that madame fribsby spied the unlucky gentleman with the train at his heels and heard the scornful shouts with which they assailed him <\s>
<s> she ran out of her room and across the street to the persecuted foreigner she held out her hand and addressing him in his own language invited him into her abode and when she had housed him fairly within her door she stood bravely at the threshold before the gibing factory girls and boys and said they were a pack of cowards to insult a poor man who could not speak their language and was alone and without protection <\s>
<s> the little crowd with some ironical cheers and hootings nevertheless felt the force of madame fribsby's vigorous allocution and retreated before her for the old lady was rather respected in the place and her oddity and her kindness had made her many friends there <\s>
<s> poor mirobolant was grateful indeed to hear the language of his country ever so ill spoken <\s>
<s> frenchmen pardon our faults in their language much more readily than we excuse their bad english and will face our blunders throughout a long conversation without the least propensity to grin <\s>
<s> the rescued artist vowed that madame fribsby was his guardian angel and that he had not as yet met with such suavity and politeness among les anglaises <\s>
<s> he was as courteous and complimentary to her as if it was the fairest and noblest of ladies whom he was addressing for alcide mirobolant paid homage after his fashion to all womankind and never dreamed of a distinction of ranks in the realms of beauty as his phrase was <\s>
<s> a cream flavoured with pineapple a mayonnaise of lobster which he flattered himself was not unworthy of his hand or of her to whom he had the honour to offer it as an homage and a box of preserved fruits of provence were brought by one of the chef's aides de camp in a basket the next day to the milliner's and were accompanied with a gallant note to the amiable madame fribsbi <\s>
<s> her kindness alcide said had made a green place in the desert of his existence her suavity would ever contrast in memory with the grossierete of the rustic population who were not worthy to possess such a jewel <\s>
<s> an intimacy of the most confidential nature thus sprang up between the milliner and the chief of the kitchen but i do not know whether it was with pleasure or mortification that madame received the declarations of friendship which the young alcides proffered to her for he persisted in calling her la respectable fribsbi la vertueuse fribsbi and in stating that he should consider her as his mother while he hoped she would regard him as her son <\s>
<s> it was not very long ago fribsby thought that words had been addressed to her in that dear french language indicating a different sort of attachment <\s>
<s> and she sighed as she looked up at the picture of her carabineer <\s>
<s> for it is surprising how young some people's hearts remain when their heads have need of a front or a little hair dye and at this moment madame fribsby as she told young alcide felt as romantic as a girl of eighteen <\s>
<s> when the conversation took this turn and at their first intimacy madame fribsby was rather inclined so to lead it alcide always politely diverged to another subject it was as his mother that he persisted in considering the good milliner <\s>
<s> he would recognise her in no other capacity and with that relationship the gentle lady was forced to content herself when she found how deeply the artist's heart was engaged elsewhere <\s>
<s> he was not long before he described to her the subject and origin of his passion <\s>
<s> i declared myself to her said alcide laying his hand on his heart in a manner which was as novel as i am charmed to think it was agreeable <\s>
<s> where cannot love penetrate respectable madame fribsbi <\s>
<s> cupid is the father of invention i inquired of the domestics what were the plats of which mademoiselle partook with most pleasure and built up my little battery accordingly <\s>
<s> on a day when her parents had gone to dine in the world and i am grieved to say that a grossier dinner at a restaurateur in the boulevard or in the palais royal seemed to form the delights of these unrefined persons the charming miss entertained some comrades of the pension and i advised myself to send up a little repast suitable to so delicate young palates <\s>
<s> her lovely name is blanche <\s>
<s> the name of the maiden is white the wreath of roses which she wears is white <\s>
<s> i determined that my dinner should be as spotless as the snow <\s>
<s> at her accustomed hour and instead of the rude gigot a l'eau which was ordinarily served at her too simple table i sent her up a little potage a la reine a la reine blanche i called it as white as her own tint and confectioned with the most fragrant cream and almonds <\s>
<s> i then offered up at her shrine a filet de merlan a l'gnes and a delicate plat which i designated as eperlan a la sainte therese and of which my charming miss partook with pleasure <\s>
<s> i followed this by two little entrees of sweetbread and chicken and the only brown thing which i permitted myself in the entertainment was a little roast of lamb which i lay in a meadow of spinaches surrounded with croustillons representing sheep and ornamented with daisies and other savage flowers <\s>
<s> after this came my second service a pudding a la reine elizabeth who madame fribsbi knows was a maiden princess ); a dish of opal coloured plover's eggs which i called nid de tourtereaux a la roucoule placing in the midst of them two of those tender volatiles billing each other and confectioned with butter a basket containing little gateaux of apricots which i know all young ladies adore and a jelly of marasquin bland insinuating intoxicating as the glance of beauty <\s>
<s> this i designated ambroisie de calypso a la souveraine de mon coeur <\s>
<s> and when the ice was brought in an ice of plombiere and cherries how do you think i had shaped them madame fribsbi <\s>
<s> in the form of two hearts united with an arrow on which i had laid before it entered a bridal veil in cut paper surmounted by a wreath of virginal orange flowers <\s>
<s> i stood at the door to watch the effect of this entry <\s>
<s> it was but one cry of admiration <\s>
<s> the three young ladies filled their glasses with the sparkling ay and carried me in a toast <\s>
<s> i heard it i heard miss speak of me i heard her say tell monsieur mirobolant that we thank him we admire him we love him <\s>
<s> my feet almost failed me as she spoke <\s>
<s> since that can i have any reason to doubt that the young artist has made some progress in the heart of the english miss <\s>
<s> i am modest but my glass informs me that i am not ill looking <\s>
<s> other victories have convinced me of the fact <\s>
<s> the blond misses of albion see nothing in the dull inhabitants of their brumous isle which can compare with the ardour and vivacity of the children of the south <\s>
<s> we bring our sunshine with us we are frenchmen and accustomed to conquer <\s>
<s> were it not for this affair of the heart and my determination to marry an anglaise do you think i would stop in this island which is not altogether ungrateful since i have found here a tender mother in the respectable madame fribsbi in this island in this family <\s>
<s> my genius would use itself in the company of these rustics the poesy of my art cannot be understood by these carnivorous insularies <\s>
<s> no the men are odious but the women the women <\s>
<s> i own dear fribsbi are seducing <\s>
<s> i have vowed to marry one and as i cannot go into your markets and purchase according to the custom of the country i am resolved to adopt another custom and fly with one to gretna grin <\s>
<s> the blonde miss will go <\s>
<s> her eyes have told me so <\s>
<s> the white dove wants but the signal to fly <\s>
<s> have you any correspondence with her <\s>
<s> asked fribsby in amazement and not knowing whether the young lady or the lover might be labouring under a romantic delusion <\s>
<s> i correspond with her by means of my art <\s>
<s> she partakes of dishes which i make expressly for her <\s>
<s> i insinuate to her thus a thousand hints which as she is perfectly spiritual she receives <\s>
<s> but i want other intelligences near her <\s>
<s> there is pincott her maid said madame fribsby who by aptitude or education seemed to have some knowledge of affairs of the heart but the great artist's brow darkened at this suggestion <\s>
<s> madame he said there are points upon which a gallant man ought to silence himself though if he break the secret he may do so with the least impropriety to his best friend his adopted mother <\s>
<s> know then that there is a cause why miss pincott should be hostile to me a cause not uncommon with your sex jealousy <\s>
<s> ah no said the artist with a deep bass voice and a tragic accent worthy of the port st martin and his favourite melodrames not perfidious but fatal <\s>
<s> yes i am a fatal man madame fribsbi <\s>
<s> to inspire hopeless passion is my destiny <\s>
<s> i cannot help it that women love me <\s>
<s> is it my fault that that young woman deperishes and languishes to the view of the eye consumed by a flame which i cannot return <\s>
<s> there are others in this family who are similarly unhappy <\s>
<s> the governess of the young milor has encountered me in my walks and looked at me in a way which can bear but one interpretation <\s>
<s> and milady herself who is of mature age but who has oriental blood has once or twice addressed compliments to the lonely artist which can admit of no mistake <\s>
<s> i avoid the household i seek solitude i undergo my destiny <\s>
<s> i can marry but one and am resolved it shall be to a lady of your nation <\s>
<s> and if her fortune is sufficient i think miss would be the person who would be most suitable <\s>
<s> i wish to ascertain what her means are before i lead her to gretna grin <\s>
<s> whether alcides was as irresistible a conqueror as his namesake or whether he was simply crazy is a point which must be left to the reader's judgment <\s>
<s> but the latter if he had had the benefit of much french acquaintance has perhaps met with men amongst them who fancied themselves almost as invincible and who if you credit them have made equal havoc in the hearts of les anglaises <\s>
<s> contains both love and jealousy our readers have already heard sir francis clavering's candid opinion of the lady who had given him her fortune and restored him to his native country and home and it must be owned that the baronet was not far wrong in his estimate of his wife and that lady clavering was not the wisest or the best educated of women <\s>
<s> she had had a couple of years education in europe in a suburb of london which she persisted in calling ackney to her dying day whence she had been summoned to join her father at calcutta at the age of fifteen <\s>
<s> and it was on her voyage thither on board the ramchunder east indiaman captain bragg in which ship she had two years previously made her journey to europe that she formed the acquaintance of her first husband mr <\s>
<s> amory who was third mate of the vessel in question <\s>
<s> we are not going to enter into the early part of lady clavering's history but captain bragg under whose charge miss snell went out to her father who was one of the captain's consignees and part owner of the ramchunder and many other vessels found reason to put the rebellious rascal of a mate in irons until they reached the cape where the captain left his officer behind and finally delivered his ward to her father at calcutta after a stormy and perilous voyage in which the ramchunder and the cargo and passengers incurred no small danger and damage <\s>
<s> some months afterwards amory made his appearance at calcutta having worked his way out before the mast from the cape married the rich attorney's daughter in spite of that old speculator set up as indigo planter and failed set up as agent and failed again set up as editor of the sunderbund pilot and failed again quarrelling ceaselessly with his father in law and his wife during the progress of all these mercantile transactions and disasters and ending his career finally with a crash which compelled him to leave calcutta and go to new south wales <\s>
<s> it was in the course of these luckless proceedings that mr <\s>
<s> amory probably made the acquaintance of sir jasper rogers the respected judge of the supreme court of calcutta who has been mentioned before and as the truth must out it was by making an improper use of his father in law's name who could write perfectly well and had no need of an amanuensis that fortune finally forsook mr <\s>
<s> amory and caused him to abandon all further struggles with her <\s>
<s> not being in the habit of reading the calcutta law reports very assiduously the european public did not know of these facts as well as people did in bengal and mrs <\s>
<s> amory and her father finding her residence in india not a comfortable one it was agreed that the lady should return to europe whither she came with her little daughter betsy or blanche then four years old <\s>
<s> they were accompanied by betsy's nurse who has been presented to the reader in the last chapter as the confidential maid of lady clavering mrs <\s>
<s> bonner and captain bragg took a house for them in the near neighbourhood of his residence in pocklington street <\s>
<s> it was a very hard bitter summer and the rain it rained every day for some time after mrs <\s>
<s> bragg was very pompous and disagreeable perhaps ashamed perhaps anxious to get rid of the indian lady <\s>
<s> she believed that all the world in london was talking about her husband's disaster and that the king and queen and the court of directors were aware of her unlucky history <\s>
<s> she had a good allowance from her father she had no call to live in england and she determined to go abroad <\s>
<s> away she went then glad to escape the gloomy surveillance of the odious bully captain bragg <\s>
<s> people had no objection to receive her at the continental towns where she stopped and at the various boarding houses where she royally paid her way <\s>
<s> she called hackney ackney to be sure though otherwise she spoke english with a little foreign twang very curious and not unpleasant ); she dressed amazingly she was conspicuous for her love of eating and drinking and prepared curries and pillaws at every boarding house which she frequented but her singularities of language and behaviour only gave a zest to her society and mrs <\s>
<s> amory was deservedly popular <\s>
<s> she was the most good natured jovial and generous of women <\s>
<s> she was up to any party of pleasure by whomsoever proposed <\s>
<s> she brought three times more champagne and fowl and ham to the picnics than anyone else <\s>
<s> she took endless boxes for the play and tickets for the masked balls and gave them away to everybody <\s>
<s> she paid the boarding house people months beforehand she helped poor shabby mustachiod bucks and dowagers whose remittances had not arrived with constant supplies from her purse and in this way she tramped through europe and appeared at brussels at paris at milan at naples at rome as her fancy led her <\s>
<s> news of amory's death reached her at the latter place where captain clavering was then staying unable to pay his hotel bill as indeed was his friend the chevalier strong and the good natured widow married the descendant of the ancient house of clavering professing indeed no particular grief for the scapegrace of a husband whom she had lost <\s>
<s> we have brought her thus up to the present time when she was mistress of clavering park in the midst of which mr <\s>
<s> pinckney the celebrated painter pourtrayed her with her little boy by her side <\s>
<s> missy followed her mamma in most of her peregrinations and so learned a deal of life <\s>
<s> she had a governess for some time and after her mother's second marriage the benefit of madame de caramel's select pension in the champs elysees <\s>
<s> when the claverings came to england she of course came with them <\s>
<s> it was only within a few years after the death of her grandfather and the birth of her little brother that she began to understand that her position in life was altered and that miss amory nobody's daughter was a very small personage in a house compared with master francis clavering heir to an ancient baronetcy and a noble estate <\s>
<s> but for little frank she would have been an heiress in spite of her father and though she knew and cared not much about money of which she never had any stint and though she was a romantic little muse as we have seen yet she could not reasonably be grateful to the persons who had so contributed to change her condition nor indeed did she understand what the latter really was until she had made some further progress and acquired more accurate knowledge in the world <\s>
<s> but this was clear that her stepfather was dull and weak that mamma dropped her h's and was not refined in manners or appearance and that little frank was a spoiled quarrelsome urchin always having his way always treading upon her feet always upsetting his dinner on her dresses and keeping her out of her inheritance <\s>
<s> none of these as she felt could comprehend her and her solitary heart naturally pined for other attachments and she sought around her where to bestow the precious boon of her unoccupied affection <\s>
<s> this dear girl then from want of sympathy or other cause made herself so disagreeable at home and frightened her mother and bored her stepfather so much that they were quite as anxious as she could be that she should settle for herself in life and hence sir francis clavering's desire expressed to his friend in the last chapter that mrs <\s>
<s> strong should die and that he would take blanche to himself as a second mrs <\s>
<s> but as this could not be any other person was welcome to win her and a smart young fellow well looking and well educated like our friend arthur pendennis was quite free to propose for her if he had a mind and would have been received with open arms by lady clavering as a son in law had he had the courage to come forward as a competitor for miss amory's hand <\s>
<s> pen however besides other drawbacks chose to entertain an extreme diffidence about himself <\s>
<s> he was ashamed of his late failures of his idle and nameless condition of the poverty which he had brought on his mother by his folly and there was as much of vanity as remorse in his present state of doubt and distrust <\s>
<s> how could he ever hope for such a prize as this brilliant blanche amory who lived in a fine park and mansion and was waited on by a score of grand domestics whilst a maid servant brought in their meagre meal at fairoaks and his mother was obliged to pinch and manage to make both ends meet <\s>
<s> obstacles seemed for him insurmountable which would have vanished had he marched manfully upon them and he preferred despairing or dallying with his wishes or perhaps he had not positively shaped them as yet to attempting to win gallantly the object of his desire <\s>
<s> many a young man fails by that species of vanity called shyness who might for the asking have his will <\s>
<s> but we do not pretend to say that pen had as yet ascertained his or that he was doing much more than thinking about falling in love <\s>
<s> miss amory was charming and lively <\s>
<s> she fascinated and cajoled him by a thousand arts or natural graces or flatteries <\s>
<s> but there were lurking reasons and doubts besides shyness and vanity withholding him <\s>
<s> in spite of her cleverness and her protestations and her fascinations pen's mother had divined the girl and did not trust her <\s>
<s> pendennis saw blanche light minded and frivolous detected many wants in her which offended the pure and pious minded lady a want of reverence for her parents and for things more sacred helen thought worldliness and selfishness couched under pretty words and tender expressions <\s>
<s> laura and pen battled these points strongly at first with the widow laura being as yet enthusiastic about her new friend and pen not far gone enough in love to attempt any concealment of his feelings <\s>
<s> he would laugh at these objections of helen's and say psha mother <\s>
<s> you are jealous about laura all women are jealous <\s>
<s> but when in the course of a month or two and by watching the pair with that anxiety with which brooding women watch over their sons affections and in acknowledging which i have no doubt there is a sexual jealousy on the mother's part and a secret pang when helen saw that the intimacy appeared to make progress that the two young people were perpetually finding pretexts to meet and that miss blanche was at fairoaks or mr <\s>
<s> pen at the park every day the poor widow's heart began to fail her her darling project seemed to vanish before her and giving way to her weakness she fairly told pen one day what her views and longings were that she felt herself breaking and not long for this world and that she hoped and prayed before she went that she might see her two children one <\s>
<s> the late events pen's life and career and former passion for the actress had broken the spirit of this tender lady <\s>
<s> she felt that he had escaped her and was in the maternal nest no more and she clung with a sickening fondness to laura laura who had been left to her by francis in heaven <\s>
<s> pen kissed and soothed her in his grand patronising way <\s>
<s> he had seen something of this he had long thought his mother wanted to make this marriage did laura know anything of it <\s>
<s> pendennis said not for worlds would she have breathed a word of it to laura well well there was time enough his mother wouldn't die pen said laughingly he wouldn't hear of any such thing and as for the muse she is too grand a lady to think about poor little me and as for laura who knows that she would have me <\s>
<s> she would do anything you told her to be sure <\s>
<s> but am i worthy of her <\s>
<s> o pen you might be was the widow's reply not that mr <\s>
<s> pen ever doubted that he was and a feeling of indefinable pleasure and self complacency came over him as he thought over this proposal and imaged laura to himself as his memory remembered her for years past always fair and open kindly and pious cheerful tender and true <\s>
<s> he looked at her with brightening eyes as she came in from the garden at the end of this talk her cheeks rather flushed her looks frank and smiling a basket of roses in her hand <\s>
<s> she took the finest of them and brought it to mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis who was refreshed by the odour and colour of these flowers and hung over her fondly and gave it to her <\s>
<s> and i might have this prize for the asking <\s>
<s> pen thought with a thrill of triumph as he looked at the kindly girl <\s>
<s> why she is as beautiful and as generous as her roses <\s>
<s> the image of the two women remained for ever after in his mind and he never recalled it but the tears came into his eyes <\s>
<s> before very many weeks intimacy with her new acquaintance however miss laura was obliged to give in to helen's opinion and own that the muse was selfish unkind and inconstant <\s>
<s> of course blanche confided to her bosom friend all the little griefs and domestic annoyances how the family could not comprehend her and she moved among them an isolated being how her poor mamma's education had been neglected and she was forced to blush for her blunders how sir francis was a weak person deplorably unintellectual and only happy when smoking his odious cigars how since the birth of her little brother she had seen her mother's precious affection which she valued more than anything in life estranged from her once darling daughter how she was alone alone alone in the world <\s>
<s> but these griefs real and heart rending though they might be to a young lady of exquisite sensibility did not convince laura of the propriety of blanche's conduct in many small incidents of little frank for instance life might be very provoking and might have deprived blanche of her mamma's affection but this was no reason why blanche should box the child's ears because he upset a glass of water over her drawing and why she should call him many opprobrious names in the english and french language and the preference accorded to little frank was certainly no reason why blanche should give herself imperial airs of command towards the boy's governess and send that young lady upon messages through the house to bring her book or to fetch her pocket handkerchief <\s>
<s> when a domestic performed an errand for honest laura she was always thankful and pleased whereas she could not but perceive that the little muse had not the slightest scruple in giving her commands to all the world round about her and in disturbing anybody's ease or comfort in order to administer to her own <\s>
<s> it was laura's first experience in friendship and it pained the kind creature's heart to be obliged to give up as delusions one by one those charms and brilliant qualities in which her fancy had dressed her new friend and to find that the fascinating little fairy was but a mortal and not a very amiable mortal after all <\s>
<s> what generous person is there that has not been so deceived in his time what person perhaps that has not so disappointed others in his turn <\s>
<s> after the scene with little frank in which that refractory son and heir of the house of clavering had received the compliments in french and english and the accompanying box on the ear from his sister miss laura who had plenty of humour could not help calling to mind some very touching and tender verses which the muse had read to her out of mes larmes and which began my pretty baby brother may angels guard thy rest in which the muse after complimenting the baby upon the station in life which it was about to occupy and contrasting it with her own lonely condition vowed nevertheless that the angel boy would never enjoy such affection as hers was or find in the false world before him anything so constant and tender as a sister's heart <\s>
<s> it may be the forlorn one said it may be you will slight it my pretty baby sweet you will spurn me from your bosom i'll cling around your feet <\s>
<s> o let me let me love you <\s>
<s> the world will prove to you as false as tis to others but i am ever true <\s>
<s> and behold the muse was boxing the darling brother's ears instead of kneeling at his feet and giving miss laura her first lesson in the cynical philosophy not quite her first however something like this selfishness and waywardness something like this contrast between practice and poetry between grand versified aspirations and everyday life she had witnessed at home in the person of our young friend mr <\s>
<s> but then pen was different <\s>
<s> pen was a man <\s>
<s> it seemed natural somehow that he should be self willed and should have his own way <\s>
<s> and under his waywardness and selfishness indeed there was a kind and generous heart <\s>
<s> o it was hard that such a diamond should be changed away against such a false stone as this <\s>
<s> in a word laura began to be tired of her admired blanche <\s>
<s> she had assayed her and found her not true and her former admiration and delight which she had expressed with her accustomed generous artlessness gave way to a feeling which we shall not call contempt but which was very near it and which caused laura to adopt towards miss amory a grave and tranquil tone of superiority which was at first by no means to the muse's liking <\s>
<s> nobody likes to be found out or having held a high place to submit to step down <\s>
<s> the consciousness that this event was impending did not serve to increase miss blanche's good humour and as it made her peevish and dissatisfied with herself it probably rendered her even less agreeable to the persons round about her <\s>
<s> so there arose one fatal day a battle royal between dearest blanche and dearest laura in which the friendship between them was all but slain outright <\s>
<s> dearest blanche had been unusually capricious and wicked on this day <\s>
<s> she had been insolent to her mother savage with little frank odiously impertinent in her behaviour to the boy's governess and intolerably cruel to pincott her attendant <\s>
<s> not venturing to attack her friend for the little tyrant was of a timid feline nature and only used her claws upon those who were weaker than herself she maltreated all these and especially poor pincott who was menial confidante companion slave always according to the caprice of her young mistress <\s>
<s> this girl who had been sitting in the room with the young ladies being driven thence in tears occasioned by the cruelty of her mistress and raked with a parting sarcasm as she went sobbing from the door laura fairly broke out into a loud and indignant invective wondered how one so young could forget the deference owing to her elders as well as to her inferiors in station and professing so much sensibility of her own could torture the feelings of others so wantonly <\s>
<s> laura told her friend that her conduct was absolutely wicked and that she ought to ask pardon of heaven on her knees for it <\s>
<s> and having delivered herself of a hot and voluble speech whereof the delivery astonished the speaker as much almost as her auditor she ran to her bonnet and shawl and went home across the park in a great flurry and perturbation and to the surprise of mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis who had not expected her until night <\s>
<s> alone with helen laura gave an account of the scene and gave up her friend henceforth <\s>
<s> o mamma she said you were right blanche who seems so soft and so kind is as you have said selfish and cruel <\s>
<s> she who is always speaking of her affections can have no heart <\s>
<s> no honest girl would afflict a mother so or torture a dependant and and i give her up from this day and i will have no other friend but you <\s>
<s> on this the two ladies went through the osculatory ceremony which they were in the habit of performing and mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis got a great secret comfort from the little quarrel for laura's confession seemed to say that girl can never be a wife for pen for she is light minded and heartless and quite unworthy of our noble hero <\s>
<s> he will be sure to find out her unworthiness for his own part and then he will be saved from this flighty creature and awake out of his delusion <\s>
<s> but miss laura did not tell mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis perhaps did not acknowledge to herself what had been the real cause of the day's quarrel <\s>
<s> being in a very wicked mood and bent upon mischief everywhere the little wicked muse of a blanche had very soon begun her tricks <\s>
<s> her darling laura had come to pass a long day and as they were sitting in her own room together had chosen to bring the conversation round to the subject of mr <\s>
<s> i am afraid he is sadly fickle miss blanche observed mrs <\s>
<s> pybus and many more clavering people have told us all about the actress <\s>
<s> i was quite a child when it happened and i don't know anything about it laura answered blushing very much <\s>
<s> he used her very ill blanche said wagging her little head <\s>
<s> he was false to her <\s>
<s> i am sure he was not laura cried out he acted most generously by her he wanted to give up everything to marry her <\s>
<s> it was she that was false to him <\s>
<s> he nearly broke his heart about it he i thought you didn't know anything about the story dearest interposed miss blanche <\s>
<s> mamma has said so said laura <\s>
<s> well he is very clever continued the other little dear what a sweet poet he is <\s>
<s> have you ever read his poems <\s>
<s> only the fisherman and the diver which he translated for us and his prize poem which didn't get the prize and indeed i thought it very pompous and prosy laura said laughing <\s>
<s> has he never written you any poems then love <\s>
<s> no my dear said miss bell <\s>
<s> blanche ran up to her friend kissed her fondly called her my dearest laura at least three times looked her archly in the face nodded her head and said promise to tell no o body and i will show you something <\s>
<s> and tripping across the room daintily to a little mother of pearl inlaid desk she opened it with a silver key and took out two or three papers crumpled and rather stained with green which she submitted to her friend <\s>
<s> laura took them and read them <\s>
<s> they were love verses sure enough something about undine about a naiad about a river <\s>
<s> she looked at them for a long time but in truth the lines were not very distinct before her eyes <\s>
<s> and you have answered them blanche <\s>
<s> she asked putting them back <\s>
<s> not for worlds dearest the other said and when her dearest laura had quite done with the verses she tripped back and popped them again into the pretty desk <\s>
<s> then she went to her piano and sang two or three songs of rossini whose flourishes of music her flexible little voice could execute to perfection and laura sate by vaguely listening as she performed these pieces <\s>
<s> what was miss bell thinking about the while <\s>
<s> she hardly knew but sate there silent as the songs rolled by <\s>
<s> after this concert the young ladies were summoned to the room where luncheon was served and whither they of course went with their arms round each other's waists <\s>
<s> and it could not have been jealousy or anger on laura's part which had made her silent for after they had tripped along the corridor and descended the steps and were about to open the door which leads into the hall laura paused and looking her friend kindly and frankly in the face kissed her with a sisterly warmth <\s>
<s> something occurred after this master frank's manner of eating probably or mamma's blunders or sir francis smelling of cigars which vexed miss blanche and she gave way to that series of naughtinesses whereof we have spoken and which ended in the above little quarrel <\s>
<s> a house full of visitors the difference between the girls did not last long <\s>
<s> laura was always too eager to forgive and be forgiven and as for miss blanche her hostilities never very long or durable had not been provoked by the above scene <\s>
<s> nobody cares about being accused of wickedness <\s>
<s> no vanity is hurt by that sort of charge blanche was rather pleased than provoked by her friend's indignation which never would have been raised but for a cause which both knew though neither spoke of <\s>
<s> and so laura with a sigh was obliged to confess that the romantic part of her first friendship was at an end and that the object of it was only worthy of a very ordinary sort of regard <\s>
<s> as for blanche she instantly composed a copy of touching verses setting forth her desertion and disenchantment <\s>
<s> it was only the old story she wrote of love meeting with coldness and fidelity returned by neglect and some new neighbours arriving from london about this time in whose family there were daughters miss amory had the advantage of selecting an eternal friend from one of these young ladies and imparting her sorrows and disappointments to this new sister <\s>
<s> the tall footmen came but seldom now with notes to the sweet laura the pony carriage was but rarely despatched to fairoaks to be at the orders of the ladies there <\s>
<s> blanche adopted a sweet look of suffering martyrdom when laura came to see her <\s>
<s> the other laughed at her friend's sentimental mood and treated it with a good humour that was by no means respectful <\s>
<s> but if miss blanche found new female friends to console her the faithful historian is also bound to say that she discovered some acquaintances of the other sex who seemed to give her consolation too <\s>
<s> if ever this artless young creature met a young man and had ten minutes conversation with him in a garden walk in a drawing room window or in the intervals of a waltz she confided in him so to speak made play with her beautiful eyes spoke in a tone of tender interest and simple and touching appeal and left him to perform the same pretty little drama in behalf of his successor <\s>
<s> when the claverings first came down to the park there were very few audiences before whom miss blanche could perform hence pen had all the benefits of her glances and confidences and the drawing room window or the garden walk all to himself <\s>
<s> in the town of clavering it has been said there were actually young men in the near surrounding country only a curate or two or a rustic young squire with large feet and ill made clothes <\s>
<s> to the dragoons quartered at chatteris the baronet made no overtures it was unluckily his own regiment he had left it on bad terms with some officers of the corps an ugly business about a horse bargain a disputed play account blind hookey a white feather who need ask it is not our business to inquire too closely into the bygones of our characters except in so far as their previous history appertains to the development of this present story <\s>
<s> but the autumn and the end of the parliamentary session and the london season brought one or two county families down to their houses and filled tolerably the neighbouring little watering place of baymouth and opened our friend mr <\s>
<s> bingley's theatre royal at chatteris and collected the usual company at the assizes and race balls there <\s>
<s> up to this time the old county families had been rather shy of our friends of clavering park <\s>
<s> the fogeys of drummington the squares of tozely park the welbores of the barrow etc all sorts of stories were current among these folks regarding the family at clavering indeed nobody ought to say that people in the country have no imagination who heard them talk about new neighbours <\s>
<s> about sir francis and his lady and her birth and parentage about miss amory about captain strong there had been endless histories which need not be recapitulated and the family of the park had been three months in the county before the great people around began to call <\s>
<s> but at the end of the season the earl of trehawk lord lieutenant of the county coming to eyrie castle and the countess dowager of rockminster whose son was also a magnate of the land to occupy a mansion on the marine parade at baymouth these great folks came publicly immediately and in state to call upon the family of clavering park and the carriages of the county families speedily followed in the track which had been left in the avenue by their lordly wheels <\s>
<s> it was then that mirobolant began to have an opportunity of exercising that skill which he possessed and of forgetting in the occupations of his art the pangs of love <\s>
<s> it was then that the large footmen were too much employed at clavering park to be able to bring messages or dally over the cup of small beer with the poor little maids at fairoaks <\s>
<s> it was then that blanche found other dear friends than laura and other places to walk in besides the river side where pen was fishing <\s>
<s> he came day after day and whipped the stream but the fish fish <\s>
<s> wouldn't do their duty nor the peri appear <\s>
<s> and here though in strict confidence and with a request that the matter go no further we may as well allude to a delicate business of which previous hint has been given <\s>
<s> mention has been made in a former page of a certain hollow tree at which pen used to take his station when engaged in his passion for miss fotheringay and the cavity of which he afterwards used for other purposes than to insert his baits and fishing cans in <\s>
<s> the truth is be converted this tree into a post office <\s>
<s> under a piece of moss and a stone he used to put little poems or letters equally poetical which were addressed to a certain undine or naiad who frequented the stream and which once or twice were replaced by a receipt in the shape of a flower or by a modest little word or two of acknowledgment written in a delicate hand in french or english and on pink scented paper <\s>
<s> certainly miss amory used to walk by this stream as we have seen and it is a fact that she used pink scented paper for her correspondence <\s>
<s> but after the great folks had invaded clavering park and the family coach passed out of the lodge gates evening after evening on their way to the other great country houses nobody came to fetch pen's letters at the post office the white paper was not exchanged for the pink but lay undisturbed under its stone and its moss whilst the tree was reflected into the stream and the brawl went rolling by <\s>
<s> there was not much in the letters certainly in the pink notes scarcely anything merely a little word or two half jocular half sympathetic such as might be written by any young lady <\s>
<s> but oh you silly pendennis if you wanted this one why did you not speak <\s>
<s> perhaps neither party was in earnest <\s>
<s> you were only playing at being in love and the sportive little undine was humouring you at the same play <\s>
<s> but if a man is baulked at this game he not unfrequently loses his temper and when nobody came any more for pen's poems he began to look upon those compositions in a very serious light <\s>
<s> he felt almost tragical and romantic again as in his first affair of the heart at any rate he was bent upon having an explanation <\s>
<s> one day he went to the hall and there was a roomful of visitors on another miss amory was not to be seen she was going to a ball that night and was lying down to take a little sleep <\s>
<s> pen cursed balls and the narrowness of his means and the humility of his position in the country that caused him to be passed over by the givers of these entertainments <\s>
<s> on a third occasion miss amory was in the garden and he ran thither she was walking there in state with no less personages than the bishop and bishopess of chatteris and the episcopal family who scowled at him and drew up in great dignity when he was presented to them and they heard his name <\s>
<s> the right reverend prelate had heard it before and also of the little transaction in the dean's garden <\s>
<s> the bishop says you're a sad young man good natured lady clavering whispered to him <\s>
<s> what have you been a doing of <\s>
<s> nothink i hope to vex such a dear mar as yours <\s>
<s> how is your dear mar <\s>
<s> why don't she come and me <\s>
<s> we an't seen her this ever such a time <\s>
<s> we're a goin about a gaddin so that we don't see no neighbours now <\s>
<s> give my love to her and laurar and come all to dinner to morrow <\s>
<s> pendennis was too unwell to come out but laura and pen came and there was a great party and pen only got an opportunity of a hurried word with miss amory <\s>
<s> you never come to the river now he said <\s>
<s> i can't said blanche the house is full of people <\s>
<s> undine has left the stream mr <\s>
<s> pen went on choosing to be poetical <\s>
<s> she never ought to have gone there miss amory answered <\s>
<s> she won't go again <\s>
<s> it was very foolish very wrong it was only play <\s>
<s> besides you have other consolations at home she added looking him full in the face an instant and dropping her eyes <\s>
<s> if he wanted her why did he not speak then <\s>
<s> she might have said yes even then <\s>
<s> but as she spoke of other consolations at home he thought of laura so affectionate and so pure and of his mother at home who had bent her fond heart upon uniting him with her adopted daughter <\s>
<s> he began in a vexed tone miss amory <\s>
<s> laura is looking at us mr <\s>
<s> pendennis the young lady said <\s>
<s> i must go back to the company and she ran off leaving mr <\s>
<s> pendennis to bite his nails in perplexity and to look out into the moonlight in the garden <\s>
<s> laura indeed was looking at pen <\s>
<s> she was talking with or appearing to listen to the talk of mr <\s>
<s> pynsent lord rockminster's son and grandson of the dowager lady who was seated in state in the place of honour gravely receiving lady clavering's bad grammar and patronising the vacuous sir francis whose interest in the county she was desirous to secure <\s>
<s> pynsent and pen had been at oxbridge together where the latter during his heyday of good fortune and fashion had been the superior of the young patrician and perhaps rather supercilious towards him <\s>
<s> they had met for the first time since they parted at the university at the table to day and given each other that exceedingly impertinent and amusing demi nod of recognition which is practised in england only and only to perfection by university men and which seems to say confound you what do you do here <\s>
<s> i knew that man at oxbridge mr <\s>
<s> pynsent said to miss bell a mr <\s>
<s> yes said miss bell <\s>
<s> he seems rather sweet upon miss amory the gentleman went on <\s>
<s> laura looked at them and perhaps thought so too but said nothing <\s>
<s> a man of large property in the county ain't he <\s>
<s> he used to talk about representing it <\s>
<s> he used to speak at the union <\s>
<s> whereabouts do his estates lie <\s>
<s> his estates lie on the other side of the river near the lodge gate <\s>
<s> he is my cousin and i live there <\s>
<s> pynsent with a laugh <\s>
<s> why on the other side of the river at fairoaks answered miss bell <\s>
<s> cover looks rather good said the simple gentleman <\s>
<s> we have nine hens and a cock a pig and an old pointer <\s>
<s> pendennis don't preserve then <\s>
<s> you should come and see him the girl said laughing and greatly amused at the notion that her pen was a great county gentleman and perhaps had given himself out to be such <\s>
<s> indeed i quite long to renew our acquaintance mr <\s>
<s> pynsent said gallantly and with a look which fairly said it is you that i would like to come and see to which look and speech miss laura vouchsafed a smile and made a little bow <\s>
<s> here blanche came stepping up with her most fascinating smile and ogle and begged dear laura to come and take the second in a song <\s>
<s> laura was ready to do anything good natured and went to the piano by which mr <\s>
<s> pynsent listened as long as the duet lasted and until miss amory began for herself when he strode away <\s>
<s> what a nice frank amiable well bred girl that is wagg said mr <\s>
<s> pynsent to a gentleman who had come over with him from baymouth the tall one i mean with the ringlets and red lips monstrous red ain't they <\s>
<s> what do you think of the girl of the house <\s>
<s> i think she's a lean scraggy humbug said mr <\s>
<s> pynsent with great candour <\s>
<s> she drags her shoulders out of her dress she never lets her eyes alone and she goes simpering and ogling about like a french waiting maid <\s>
<s> pynsent be civil cried the other somebody can hear <\s>
<s> oh it's pendennis of boniface mr <\s>
<s> pendennis we were just talking of your charming cousin <\s>
<s> any relation to my old friend major pendennis <\s>
<s> had the pleasure of meeting you at gaunt house mr <\s>
<s> pen said with his very best air the acquaintance between the gentlemen was made in an instant <\s>
<s> in the afternoon of the next day the two gentlemen who were staying at clavering park were found by mr <\s>
<s> pen on his return from a fishing excursion in which he had no sport seated in his mother's drawing room in comfortable conversation with the widow and her ward <\s>
<s> pynsent tall and gaunt with large red whiskers and an imposing tuft to his chin was striding over a chair in the intimate neighbourhood of miss laura <\s>
<s> she was amused by his talk which was simple straightforward rather humorous and keen and interspersed with homely expressions of a style which is sometimes called slang <\s>
<s> it was the first specimen of a young london dandy that laura had seen or heard for she had been but a chit at the time of mr <\s>
<s> foker's introduction at fairoaks nor indeed was that ingenuous gentleman much more than a boy and his refinement was only that of a school and college <\s>
<s> wagg as he entered the fairoaks premises with his companion eyed and noted everything <\s>
<s> old gardener he said seeing mr <\s>
<s> john at the lodge old red livery waistcoat clothes hanging out to dry on the gooseberry bushes blue aprons white ducks gad they must be young pendennis's white ducks nobody else wears em in the family <\s>
<s> rather a shy place for a sucking county member ay pynsent <\s>
<s> snug little crib said mr <\s>
<s> pynsent pretty cosy little lawn <\s>
<s> pendennis at home old gentleman <\s>
<s> wagg said to the old domestic <\s>
<s> john answered no master pendennis was agone out <\s>
<s> are the ladies at home <\s>
<s> asked the younger visitor <\s>
<s> john answered yes they be and as the pair walked over the trim gravel and by the neat shrubberies up the steps to the hall door which old john opened mr <\s>
<s> wagg noted everything that he saw the barometer and the letter bag the umbrellas and the ladies clogs pen's hats and tartan wrapper and old john opening the drawing room door to introduce the new comers <\s>
<s> such minutiae attracted wagg instinctively he seized them in spite of himself <\s>
<s> old fellow does all the work he whispered to pynsent <\s>
<s> shouldn't wonder if he's the housemaid <\s>
<s> the next minute the pair were in the presence of the fairoaks ladies in whom pynsent could not help recognising two perfectly well bred ladies and to whom mr <\s>
<s> wagg made his obeisance with florid bows and extra courtesy accompanied with an occasional knowing leer at his companion <\s>
<s> pynsent did not choose to acknowledge these signals except by extreme haughtiness towards mr <\s>
<s> wagg and particular deference to the ladies <\s>
<s> if there was one thing laughable in mr <\s>
<s> wagg's eyes it was poverty <\s>
<s> he had the soul of a butler who had been brought from his pantry to make fun in the drawing room <\s>
<s> his jokes were plenty and his good nature thoroughly genuine but he did not seem to understand that a gentleman could wear an old coat or that a lady could be respectable unless she had her carriage or employed a french milliner <\s>
<s> charming place ma'am said he bowing to the widow noble prospect delightful to us cocknies who seldom see anything but pall mall <\s>
<s> the widow said simply she had never been in london but once in her life before her son was born <\s>
<s> fine village ma'am fine village said mr <\s>
<s> wagg and increasing every day <\s>
<s> it'll be quite a large town soon <\s>
<s> it's not a bad place to live in for those who can't get the country and will repay a visit when you honour it <\s>
<s> my brother major pendennis has often mentioned your name to us the widow said and we have been very much amused by some of your droll books sir helen continued who never could be brought to like mr <\s>
<s> wagg's books and detested their tone most thoroughly <\s>
<s> he is my very good friend mr <\s>
<s> wagg said with a low bow and one of the best known men about town and where known ma'am appreciated i assure you appreciated <\s>
<s> he is with our friend steyne at aix la chapelle <\s>
<s> steyne has a touch of the gout and so between ourselves has your brother <\s>
<s> i am going to stillbrook for the pheasant shooting and afterwards to bareacres where pendennis and i shall probably meet and he poured out a flood of fashionable talk introducing the names of a score of peers and rattling on with breathless spirits whilst the simple widow listened in silent wonder <\s>
<s> what a man she thought are all the men of fashion in london like this <\s>
<s> i am sure pen will never like him <\s>
<s> pynsent was in the meanwhile engaged with miss laura <\s>
<s> he named some of the houses in the neighbourhood whither he was going and hoped very much that he should see miss bell at some of them <\s>
<s> he hoped that her aunt would give her a season in london <\s>
<s> he said that in the next parliament it was probable that he should canvass the county and he hoped to get pendennis's interest here <\s>
<s> he spoke of pen's triumph as an orator at oxbridge and asked was he coming into parliament too <\s>
<s> he talked on very pleasantly and greatly to laura's satisfaction until pen himself appeared and as has been said found these gentlemen <\s>
<s> pen behaved very courteously to the pair now that they have found their way into his quarters and though he recollected with some twinges a conversation at oxbridge when pynsent was present and in which after a great debate at the union and in the midst of considerable excitement produced by a supper and champagne cup he had announced his intention of coming in for his native county and had absolutely returned thanks in a fine speech as the future member yet mr <\s>
<s> pynsent's manner was so frank and cordial that pen hoped pynsent might have forgotten his little fanfaronnade and any other braggadocio speeches or actions which he might have made <\s>
<s> he suited himself to the tone of the visitors then and talked about plinlimmon and magnus charters and the old set at oxbridge with careless familiarity and high bred ease as if he lived with marquises every day and a duke was no more to him than a village curate <\s>
<s> but at this juncture and it being then six o'clock in the evening betsy the maid who did not know of the advent of strangers walked into the room without any preliminary but that of flinging the door wide open before her and bearing in her arms a tray containing three tea cups a tea pot and a plate of thick bread and butter <\s>
<s> all pen's splendour and magnificence vanished away at this and he faltered and became quite abashed <\s>
<s> what will they think of us <\s>
<s> he thought and indeed wagg thrust his tongue in his cheek thought the tea infinitely contemptible and leered and winked at pynsent to that effect <\s>
<s> pynsent the transaction appeared perfectly simple there was no reason present to his mind why people should not drink tea at six if they were minded as well as at any other hour and he asked of mr <\s>
<s> wagg when they went away what the devil he was grinning and winking at and what amused him <\s>
<s> didn't you see how the cub was ashamed of the thick bread and butter <\s>
<s> i dare say they're going to have treacle if they are good <\s>
<s> i'll take an opportunity of telling old pendennis when we get back to town mr <\s>
<s> don't see the fun said mr <\s>
<s> never thought you did growled wagg between his teeth they walked home rather sulkily <\s>
<s> wagg told the story at dinner very smartly with wonderful accuracy of observation <\s>

<s> the lights and the crowd and music excited her <\s>
<s> as she spread out her white robes and performed her part of the dance smiling and happy her brown ringlets flowing back over her fair shoulders from her honest rosy face more than one gentleman in the room admired and looked after her and lady fogey who had a house in london and gave herself no small airs of fashion when in the country asked of lady rockminster who the young person was mentioned a reigning beauty in london whom in her ladyship's opinion laura was rather like and pronounced that she would do <\s>
<s> lady rockminster would have been very much surprised if any protegee of hers would not do and wondered at lady fogey's impudence in judging upon the point at all <\s>
<s> she surveyed laura with majestic glances through her eyeglass <\s>

<s> her manner is very good her ladyship thought <\s>
<s> her arms are rather red but that is a defect of her youth <\s>

<s> miss blanche was indeed the vis a vis of miss laura and smiled most killingly upon her dearest friend and nodded to her and talked to her when they met during the quadrille evolutions and patronised her a great deal <\s>
<s> her shoulders were the whitest in the whole room and they were never easy in her frock for one single instant nor were her eyes which rolled about incessantly nor was her little figure it seemed to say to all the people come and look at me not at that pink healthy bouncing country lass miss bell who scarcely knew how to dance till i taught her <\s>
<s> this is the true parisian manner this is the prettiest little foot in the room and the prettiest little chaussure too <\s>

<s> pendennis you who are scowling behind the curtain i know you are longing to dance with me <\s>
<s> laura went on dancing and keeping an attentive eye upon mr <\s>

<s> he did not quit that retirement during the first quadrille nor until the second when the good natured lady clavering beckoned to him to come up to her to the dais or place of honour where the dowagers were and whither pen went blushing and exceedingly awkward as most conceited young fellows are <\s>
<s> he performed a haughty salutation to lady rockminster who hardly acknowledged his bow and then went and paid his respects to the widow of the late amory who was splendid in diamonds velvet lace feathers and all sorts of millinery and goldsmith's ware <\s>
<s> fogey then in the fifth form at eton and ardently expecting his beard and his commission in a dragoon regiment was the second partner who was honoured with miss bell's hand <\s>

<s> he thought he had never seen so charming a creature <\s>
<s> i like you much better than the french girl for this young gentleman had been dancing with miss amory before he candidly said to her <\s>
<s> laura laughed and looked more good humoured than ever and in the midst of her laughter caught a sight of pen and continued to laugh as he on his side continued to look absurdly pompous and sulky <\s>
<s> the next dance was a waltz and young fogey thought with a sigh that he did not know how to waltz and vowed he would have a master the next holidays <\s>
<s> pynsent again claimed miss bell's hand for this dance and pen beheld her in a fury twirling round the room her waist encircled by the arm of that gentleman <\s>
<s> he never used to be angry before when on summer evenings the chairs and tables being removed and the governess called downstairs to play the piano he and the chevalier strong who was a splendid performer and could dance a british hornpipe a german waltz or a spanish fandango if need were and the two young ladies blanche and laura improvised little balls at clavering park <\s>
<s> laura enjoyed this dancing so much and was so animated that she even animated mr <\s>
<s> blanche who could dance beautifully had an unlucky partner captain broadfoot of the dragoons then stationed at chatteris <\s>
<s> for captain broadfoot though devoting himself with great energy to the object in view could not get round in time and not having the least ear for music was unaware that his movements were too slow <\s>
<s> so in the waltz as in the quadrille miss blanche saw that her dear friend laura had the honours of the dance and was by no means pleased with the latter's success <\s>
<s> after a couple of turns with the heavy dragoon she pleaded fatigue and requested to be led back to her place near her mamma to whom pen was talking and she asked him why he had not asked her to waltz and had left her for the mercies of that great odious man in spurs and a red coat <\s>
<s> i thought spurs and scarlet were the most fascinating objects in the world to young ladies pen answered <\s>
<s> i never should have dared to put my black coat in competition with that splendid red jacket <\s>
<s> you are very unkind and cruel and sulky and naughty said miss amory with another shrug of the shoulders <\s>
<s> you had better go away <\s>
<s> your cousin is looking at us over mr <\s>
<s> will you waltz with me <\s>
<s> i can't having just sent away that good captain broadfoot <\s>
<s> pynsent did you ever see such a creature <\s>
<s> but i will dance the next waltz with you and the quadrille too <\s>
<s> i am promised but i will tell mr <\s>
<s> poole that i had forgotten my engagement to you <\s>
<s> women forget very readily pendennis said <\s>
<s> but they always come back and are very repentant and sorry for what they've done blanche said <\s>
<s> see here comes the foker and dear laura leaning on him <\s>
<s> how pretty she looks <\s>
<s> laura came up and put out her hand to pen to whom pynsent made a sort of bow appearing to be not much more graceful than that domestic instrument to which miss amory compared him <\s>
<s> but laura's face was full of kindness <\s>
<s> i am so glad to have come dear pen she said <\s>
<s> i can speak to you now <\s>
<s> the three dances are over and i am engaged to you for the next pen <\s>
<s> i have just engaged myself to miss amory said pen and miss amory nodded her head and made her usual little curtsey <\s>
<s> i don't intend to give him up dearest laura she said <\s>
<s> well then he'll waltz with me dear blanche said the other <\s>
<s> i promised to waltz with miss amory <\s>
<s> said laura and making a curtsey in her turn she went and placed herself under the ample wing of lady rockminster <\s>
<s> pen was delighted with his mischief <\s>
<s> the two prettiest girls in the room were quarrelling about him <\s>
<s> he flattered himself he had punished miss laura <\s>
<s> he leaned in a dandified air with his elbow over the wall and talked to blanche he quizzed unmercifully all the men in the room the heavy dragoons in their tight jackets the country dandies in their queer attire the strange toilettes of the ladies <\s>
<s> one seemed to have a bird's nest in her head another had six pounds of grapes in her hair besides her false pearls <\s>
<s> it's a coiffure of almonds and raisins said pen and might be served up for dessert <\s>
<s> in a word he was exceedingly satirical and amusing <\s>
<s> during the quadrille he carried on this kind of conversation with unflinching bitterness and vivacity and kept blanche continually laughing both at his wickedness and jokes which were good and also because laura was again their vis a vis and could see and hear how merry and confidential they were <\s>
<s> arthur is charming to night she whispered to laura across cornet perch's shell jacket as pen was performing cavalier seul before them drawling through that figure with a thumb in the pocket of each waistcoat <\s>
<s> arthur answered blanche in french <\s>
<s> oh it's such a pretty name <\s>
<s> and now the young ladies went over to pen's side and cornet perch performed a pas seul in his turn <\s>
<s> he had no waistcoat pocket to put his hands into and they looked large and swollen as they hung before him depending from the tight arms in the jacket <\s>
<s> during the interval between the quadrille and the succeeding waltz pen did not take any notice of laura except to ask her whether her partner cornet perch was an amusing youth and whether she liked him so well as her other partner mr <\s>
<s> having planted which two daggers in laura's gentle bosom mr <\s>
<s> pendennis proceeded to rattle on with blanche amory and to make jokes good or bad but which were always loud <\s>
<s> laura was at a loss to account for her cousin's sulky behaviour and ignorant in what she had offended him however she was not angry in her turn at pen's splenetic mood for she was the most good natured and forgiving of women and besides an exhibition of jealousy on a man's part is not always disagreeable to a lady <\s>
<s> as pen would not dance with her she was glad to take up with the active chevalier strong who was a still better performer than pen and being very fond of dancing as every brisk and innocent young girl should be when the waltz music began she set off and chose to enjoy herself with all her heart <\s>
<s> captain broadfoot on this occasion occupied the floor in conjunction with a lady of proportions scarcely inferior to his own miss roundle a large young woman in a strawberry ice coloured crape dress the daughter of the lady with the grapes in her head whose bunches pen had admired <\s>
<s> and now taking his time and with his fair partner blanche hanging lovingly on the arm which encircled her mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis set out upon his waltzing career and felt as he whirled round to the music that he and blanche were performing very brilliantly indeed <\s>
<s> very likely he looked to see if miss bell thought so too but she did not or would not see him and was always engaged with her partner captain strong <\s>
<s> but pen's triumph was not destined to last long and it was doomed that poor blanche was to have yet another discomfiture on that unfortunate night <\s>
<s> while she and pen were whirling round as light and brisk as a couple of opera dancers honest captain broadfoot and the lady round whose large waist he was clinging were twisting round very leisurely according to their natures and indeed were in everybody's way <\s>
<s> but they were more in pendennis's way than in anybody's else for he and blanche whilst executing their rapid gyrations came bolt up against the heavy dragoon and his lady and with such force that the centre of gravity was lost by all four of the circumvolving bodies captain broadfoot and miss roundle were fairly upset as was pen himself who was less lucky than his partner miss amory who was only thrown upon a bench against a wall <\s>
<s> but pendennis came fairly down upon the floor sprawling in the general ruin with broadfoot and miss roundle <\s>
<s> the captain though heavy was good natured and was the first to burst out into a loud laugh at his own misfortune which nobody therefore heeded <\s>
<s> but miss amory was savage at her mishap miss roundle placed on her seant and looking pitifully round presented an object which very few people could see without laughing and pen was furious when he heard the people giggling about him <\s>
<s> he was one of those sarcastic young fellows that did not bear a laugh at his own expense and of all things in the world feared ridicule most <\s>
<s> as he got up laura and strong were laughing at him everybody was laughing pynsent and his partner were laughing and pen boiled with wrath against the pair and could have stabbed them both on the spot <\s>
<s> he turned away in a fury from them and began blundering out apologies to miss amory <\s>
<s> it was the other couple's fault the woman in pink had done it pen hoped miss amory was not hurt would she not have the courage to take another turn <\s>
<s> miss amory in a pet said she was very much hurt indeed and she would not take another turn and she accepted with great thanks a glass of water which a cavalier who wore a blue ribbon and a three pointed star rushed to fetch for her when he had seen the deplorable accident <\s>
<s> she drank the water smiled upon the bringer gracefully and turning her white shoulder at mr <\s>
<s> pen in the most marked and haughty manner besought the gentleman with the star to conduct her to her mamma and she held out her hand in order to take his arm <\s>
<s> the man with the star trembled with delight at this mark of her favour he bowed over her hand pressed it to his coat fervidly and looked round him with triumph <\s>
<s> it was no other than the happy mirobolant whom blanche had selected as an escort <\s>
<s> but the truth is that the young lady had never fairly looked in the artist's face since he had been employed in her mother's family and had no idea but it was a foreign nobleman on whose arm she was leaning <\s>
<s> as she went off pen forgot his humiliation in his surprise and cried out by jove it's the cook <\s>
<s> the instant he had uttered the words he was sorry for having spoken them for it was blanche who had herself invited mirobolant to escort her nor could the artist do otherwise than comply with a lady's command <\s>
<s> blanche in her flutter did not hear what arthur said but mirobolant heard him and cast a furious glance at him over his shoulder which rather amused mr <\s>
<s> he was in a mischievous and sulky humour wanting perhaps to pick a quarrel with somebody but the idea of having insulted a cook or that such an individual should have any feeling of honour at all did not much enter into the mind of this lofty young aristocrat the apothecary's son <\s>
<s> it had never entered that poor artist's head that he as a man was not equal to any other mortal or that there was anything in his position so degrading as to prevent him from giving his arm to a lady who asked for it <\s>
<s> he had seen in the fetes in his own country fine ladies not certainly demoiselles but the demoiselle anglaise he knew was a great deal more free than the spinster in france join in the dance with blaise or pierre and he would have taken blanche up to lady clavering and possibly have asked her to dance too but he heard pen's exclamation which struck him as if it had shot him and cruelly humiliated and angered him <\s>
<s> she did not know what caused him to start and to grind a gascon oath between his teeth <\s>
<s> but strong who was acquainted with the poor fellow's state of mind having had the interesting information from our friend madame fribsby was luckily in the way when wanted and saying something rapidly in spanish which the other understood the chevalier begged miss amory to come and take an ice before she went back to lady clavering <\s>
<s> upon which the unhappy mirobolant relinquished the arm which he had held for a minute and with a most profound and piteous bow fell back <\s>
<s> don't you know who it is <\s>
<s> strong asked of miss amory as he led her away <\s>
<s> it is the chef mirobolant <\s>
<s> how should i know <\s>
<s> he has a croix he is very distingue he has beautiful eyes <\s>
<s> the poor fellow is mad for your beaux yeux i believe strong said <\s>
<s> he is a very good cook but he is not quite right in the head <\s>
<s> what did you say to him in the unknown tongue <\s>
<s> he is a gascon and comes from the borders of spain strong answered <\s>
<s> i told him he would lose his place if he walked with you <\s>
<s> did you see the look he gave pendennis strong asked enjoying the idea of the mischief i think he would like to run little pen through with one of his spits <\s>
<s> he is an odious conceited clumsy creature that mr <\s>
<s> broadfoot looked as if he would like to kill him too so did pynsent strong said <\s>
<s> what ice will you have water ice or cream ice <\s>
<s> who is that odd man staring at me he is decore too <\s>
<s> that is my friend colonel altamont a very queer character in the service of the nawaub of lucknow <\s>
<s> i'll be back in an instant said the chevalier and sprang out of the room to the ballroom where a scuffle and a noise of high voices was heard <\s>
<s> the refreshment room in which miss amory now found herself was a room set apart for the purposes of supper which mr <\s>
<s> rincer the landlord had provided for those who chose to partake at the rate of five shillings per head <\s>
<s> also refreshments of a superior class were here ready for the ladies and gentlemen of the county families who came to the ball but the commoner sort of persons were kept out of the room by a waiter who stood at the portal and who said that was a select room for lady clavering and lady rockminster's parties and not to be opened to the public till supper time which was not to be until past midnight <\s>
<s> pynsent who danced with his constituents daughters took them and their mammas in for their refreshment there <\s>
<s> strong who was manager and master of the revels wherever he went had of course the entree and the only person who was now occupying the room was the gentleman with the black wig and the orders in his button hole the officer in the service of his highness the nawaub of lucknow <\s>
<s> this gentleman had established himself very early in the evening in this apartment where saying he was confoundedly thirsty he called for a bottle of champagne <\s>
<s> at this order the waiter instantly supposed that he had to do with a grandee and the colonel sate down and began to eat his supper and absorb his drink and enter affably into conversation with anybody who entered the room <\s>
<s> sir francis clavering and mr <\s>
<s> wagg found him there when they left the ballroom which they did pretty early sir francis to go and smoke a cigar and look at the people gathered outside the ballroom on the shore which he declared was much better fun than to remain within mr <\s>
<s> wagg to hang on to a baronet's arm as he was always pleased to do on the arm of the greatest man in the company <\s>
<s> colonel altamont had stared at these gentlemen in so odd a manner as they passed through the select room that clavering made inquiries of the landlord who he was and hinted a strong opinion that the officer of the nawaub's service was drunk <\s>
<s> pynsent too had had the honour of a conversation with the servant of the indian potentate <\s>
<s> it was pynsent's cue to speak to everybody which he did to do him justice in the most ungracious manner ); and he took the gentleman in the black wig for some constituent some merchant captain or other outlandish man of the place <\s>
<s> pynsent then coming into the refreshment room with a lady the wife of a constituent on his arm the colonel asked him if he would try a glass of sham <\s>
<s> pynsent took it with great gravity bowed tasted the wine and pronounced it excellent and with the utmost politeness retreated before colonel altamont <\s>
<s> this gravity and decorum routed and surprised the colonel more than any other kind of behaviour probably would he stared after pynsent stupidly and pronounced to the landlord over the counter that he was a rum one <\s>
<s> rincer blushed and hardly knew what to say <\s>
<s> pynsent was a county earl's grandson going to set up as a parliament man <\s>
<s> colonel altamont on the other hand wore orders and diamonds jingled sovereigns constantly in his pocket and paid his way like a man so not knowing what to say mr <\s>

<s> altamont having remained at the buffet almost all night and employed himself very actively whilst there had considerably flushed his brain by drinking and he was still going on drinking when mr <\s>
<s> strong and miss amory entered the room <\s>
<s> when the chevalier ran out of the apartment attracted by the noise in the dancing room the colonel rose from his chair with his little red eyes glowing like coals and with rather an unsteady gait advanced towards blanche who was sipping her ice <\s>
<s> she was absorbed in absorbing it for it was very fresh and good or she was not curious to know what was going on in the adjoining room although the waiters were who ran after chevalier strong <\s>
<s> so that when she looked up from her glass she beheld this strange man staring at her out of his little red eyes <\s>
<s> it was quite exciting <\s>
<s> and so you're betsy amory said he after gazing at her <\s>
<s> betsy amory by jove <\s>
<s> who who speaks to me <\s>
<s> said betsy alias blanche <\s>
<s> but the noise in the ballroom is really becoming so loud that we must rush back thither and see what is the cause of the disturbance <\s>
<s> which is both quarrelsome and sentimental civil war was raging high words passing people pushing and squeezing together in an unseemly manner round a window in the corner of the ballroom close by the door through which the chevalier strong shouldered his way <\s>
<s> through the opened window the crowd in the street below was sending up sarcastic remarks such as pitch into him <\s>
<s> and the like and a ring of individuals amongst whom madame fribsby was conspicuous was gathered round monsieur alcide mirobolant on the one side whilst several gentlemen and ladies surrounded our friend arthur pendennis on the other <\s>
<s> strong penetrated into this assembly elbowing by madame fribsby who was charmed at the chevalier's appearance and cried save him save him <\s>
<s> in frantic and pathetic accents <\s>
<s> the cause of the disturbance it appeared was the angry little chef of sir francis clavering's culinary establishment <\s>
<s> shortly after strong had quitted the room and whilst mr <\s>
<s> pen greatly irate at his downfall in the waltz which had made him look ridiculous in the eyes of the nation and by miss amory's behaviour to him which had still further insulted his dignity was endeavouring to get some coolness of body and temper by looking out of window towards the sea which was sparkling in the distance and murmuring in a wonderful calm whilst he was really trying to compose himself and owning to himself perhaps that he had acted in a very absurd and peevish manner during the night he felt a hand upon his shoulder and on looking round beheld to his utter surprise and horror that the hand in question belonged to monsieur mirobolant whose eyes were glaring out of his pale face and ringlets at mr <\s>
<s> to be tapped on the shoulder by a french cook was a piece of familiarity which made the blood of the pendennises to boil up in the veins of their descendant and he was astounded almost more than enraged at such an indignity <\s>
<s> mirobolant said in his own language to pen <\s>
<s> what is that to you pray <\s>
<s> said pen in english <\s>
<s> at any rate you understand it <\s>
<s> continued the other with a bow <\s>
<s> yes sir said pen with a stamp of his foot i understand it pretty well <\s>
<s> vous me comprendrez alors monsieur pendennis replied the other rolling out his r with gascon force quand je vous dis que vous etes un lache <\s>
<s> monsieur pendennis un lache entendez vous <\s>
<s> said pen starting round on him <\s>
<s> you understand the meaning of the word and its consequences among men of honour <\s>
<s> the artist said putting his hand on his hip and staring at pen <\s>
<s> the consequences are that i will fling you out of window you impudent scoundrel bawled out mr <\s>
<s> pen and darting upon the frenchman he would very likely have put his threat into execution for the window was at hand and the artist by no means a match for the young gentleman had not captain broadfoot and another heavy officer flung themselves between the combatants had not the ladies begun to scream had not the fiddles stopped had not the crowd of people come running in that direction had not laura with a face of great alarm looked over their heads and asked for heaven's sake what was wrong had not the opportune strong made his appearance from the refreshment room and found alcides grinding his teeth and jabbering oaths in his galleon french and pen looking uncommonly wicked although trying to appear as calm as possible when the ladies and the crowd came up <\s>
<s> strong asked of the chef in spanish <\s>
<s> i am chevalier de juillet said the other slapping his breast and he has insulted me <\s>
<s> what has he said to you <\s>
<s> il m'a appele cuisinier hissed out the little frenchman <\s>
<s> strong could hardly help laughing <\s>
<s> come away with me poor chevalier he said <\s>
<s> we must not quarrel before ladies <\s>
<s> come away i will carry your message to mr <\s>
<s> pendennis the poor fellow is not right in his head he whispered to one or two people about him and others and anxious laura's face visible amongst these gathered round pen and asked the cause of the disturbance <\s>
<s> pen did not know <\s>
<s> the man was going to give his arm to a young lady on which i said that he was a cook and the man called me a coward and challenged me to fight <\s>
<s> i own i was so surprised and indignant that if you gentlemen had not stopped me i should have thrown him out of window pen said <\s>
<s> d him serve him right too the impudent foreign scoundrel the gentlemen said <\s>
<s> i i'm very sorry if i hurt his feelings though pen added and laura was glad to hear him say that although some of the young bucks said no hang the fellow hang those impudent foreigners little thrashing would do them good <\s>
<s> you will go and shake hands with him before you go to sleep won't you pen <\s>
<s> said laura coming up to him <\s>
<s> foreigners may be more susceptible than we are and have different manners <\s>
<s> if you hurt a poor man's feelings i am sure you would be the first to ask his pardon <\s>
<s> wouldn't you dear pen <\s>
<s> she looked all forgiveness and gentleness like an angel as she spoke and pen took both her hands and looked into her kind face and said indeed he would <\s>
<s> how fond that girl is of me <\s>
<s> he thought as she stood gazing at him <\s>
<s> shall i speak to her now <\s>
<s> i must have this absurd business with the frenchman over <\s>
<s> laura asked wouldn't he stop and dance with her <\s>
<s> she was as anxious to keep him in the room as he to quit it <\s>
<s> won't you stop and waltz with me pen <\s>
<s> i'm not afraid to waltz with you <\s>
<s> this was an affectionate but an unlucky speech <\s>
<s> pen saw himself prostrate on the ground having tumbled over miss roundle and the dragoon and flung blanche up against the wall saw himself on the ground and all the people laughing at him laura and pynsent amongst them <\s>
<s> i shall never dance again he replied with a dark and determined face <\s>
<s> i'm surprised you should ask me <\s>
<s> is it because you can't get blanche for a partner <\s>
<s> asked laura with a wicked unlucky captiousness <\s>
<s> because i don't wish to make a fool of myself for other people to laugh at me pen answered for you to laugh at me laura <\s>
<s> i saw you and pynsent <\s>
<s> no man shall laugh at me <\s>
<s> pen pen don't be so wicked <\s>
<s> cried out the poor girl hurt at the morbid perverseness and savage vanity of pen <\s>
<s> he was glaring round in the direction of mr <\s>
<s> pynsent as if he would have liked to engage that gentleman as he had done the cook <\s>
<s> who thinks the worse of you for stumbling in a waltz <\s>
<s> if laura does we don't <\s>
<s> why are you so sensitive and ready to think evil <\s>
<s> here again by ill luck mr <\s>
<s> pynsent came up to laura and said i have it in command from lady rockminster to ask whether i may take you in to supper <\s>
<s> i i was going in with my cousin laura said <\s>
<s> you are in such good hands that i can't do better than leave you and i'm going home <\s>
<s> pendennis pynsent said drily to which speech which in fact meant go to the deuce for an insolent jealous impertinent jackanapes whose ears i should like to box mr <\s>
<s> pendennis did not vouchsafe any reply except a bow and in spite of laura's imploring looks he left the room <\s>
<s> how beautifully calm and bright the night outside is <\s>
<s> pynsent and what a murmur the sea is making <\s>
<s> it would be pleasanter to be walking on the beach than in this hot room <\s>
<s> what a strange congregation of people continued pynsent <\s>
<s> i have had to go up and perform the agreeable to most of them the attorney's daughters the apothecary's wife i scarcely know whom <\s>
<s> there was a man in the refreshment room who insisted upon treating me to champagne a seafaring looking man extraordinarily dressed and seeming half tipsy <\s>
<s> as a public man one is bound to conciliate all these people but it is a hard task especially when one would so very much like to be elsewhere and he blushed rather as he spoke <\s>
<s> i beg your pardon said laura i i was not listening <\s>
<s> indeed i was frightened about that quarrel between my cousin and that that french person <\s>
<s> your cousin has been rather unlucky to night pynsent said <\s>
<s> there are three or four persons whom he has not succeeded in pleasing captain broadwood what is his name the officer and the young lady in red with whom he danced and miss blanche and the poor chef and i don't think he seemed to be particularly pleased with me <\s>
<s> didn't he leave me in charge to you <\s>
<s> laura said looking up into mr <\s>
<s> pynsent's face and dropping her eyes instantly like a guilty little story telling coquette <\s>
<s> indeed i can forgive him a good deal for that pynsent eagerly cried out and she took his arm and he led off his little prize in the direction of the supper room <\s>
<s> she had no great desire for that repast though it was served in rincer's well known style as the county paper said giving an account of the entertainment afterwards indeed she was very distraite and exceedingly pained and unhappy about pen <\s>
<s> captious and quarrelsome jealous and selfish fickle and violent and unjust when his anger led him astray how could her mother as indeed helen had by a thousand words and hints ask her to give her heart to such a man <\s>
<s> and suppose she were to do so would it make him happy <\s>
<s> but she got some relief at length when at the end of half an hour a long half hour it had seemed to her a waiter brought her a little note in pencil from pen who said i met cooky below ready to fight me and i asked his pardon <\s>
<s> i'm glad i did it <\s>
<s> i wanted to speak to you to night but will keep what i had to say till you come home <\s>
<s> dance away all night with pynsent and be very happy pen <\s>
<s> laura was very thankful for this letter and to think that there was goodness and forgiveness still in her mother's boy <\s>
<s> pen went downstairs his heart reproaching him for his absurd behaviour to laura whose gentle and imploring looks followed and rebuked him and he was scarcely out of the ballroom door but he longed to turn back and ask her pardon <\s>
<s> but he remembered that he had left her with that confounded pynsent <\s>
<s> he could not apologise before him <\s>
<s> he would compromise and forget his wrath and make his peace with the frenchman <\s>
<s> the chevalier was pacing down below in the hall of the inn when pen descended from the ballroom and he came up to pen with all sorts of fun and mischief lighting up his jolly face <\s>
<s> i have got him in the coffee room he said with a brace of pistols and a candle <\s>
<s> or would you like swords on the beach <\s>
<s> mirobolant is a dead hand with the foils and killed four gardes du corps with his own point in the barricades of july <\s>
<s> confound it said pen in a fury i can't fight a cook <\s>
<s> he is a chevalier of july replied the other <\s>
<s> they present arms to him in his own country <\s>
<s> and do you ask me captain strong to go out with a servant <\s>
<s> pen asked fiercely i'll call a policeman him but but you'll invite me to hair triggers <\s>
<s> cried strong with a laugh <\s>
<s> thank you for nothing i was but joking <\s>
<s> i came to settle quarrels not to fight them <\s>
<s> i have been soothing down mirobolant i have told him that you did not apply the word cook to him in an offensive sense that it was contrary to all the customs of the country that a hired officer of a household as i called it should give his arm to the daughter of the house <\s>
<s> and then he told pen the grand secret which he had had from madame fribsby of the violent passion under which the poor artist was labouring <\s>
<s> when arthur heard this tale he broke out into a hearty laugh in which strong joined and his rage against the poor cook vanished at once <\s>
<s> he had been absurdly jealous himself all the evening and had longed for a pretext to insult pynsent <\s>
<s> he remembered how jealous he had been of oaks in his first affair he was ready to pardon anything to a man under a passion like that and he went into the coffee room where mirobolant was waiting with an outstretched hand and made him a speech in french in which he declared that he was sincerement fache d'avoir use une expression qui avoit pu blesser monsieur mirobolant et qu'il donnoit sa parole comme un gentilhomme qu'il ne l'avoit jamais jamais intende said pen who made a shot at a french word for intended and was secretly much pleased with his own fluency and correctness in speaking that language <\s>
<s> cried strong as much amused with pen's speech as pleased by his kind manner <\s>
<s> and the chevalier mirobolant of course withdraws and sincerely regrets the expression of which he made use <\s>
<s> monsieur pendennis has disproved my words himself said alcide with great politeness he has shown that he is a galant homme <\s>
<s> and so they shook hands and parted arthur in the first place despatching his note to laura before he and strong committed themselves to the butcher boy <\s>
<s> as they drove along strong complimented pen upon his behaviour as well as upon his skill in french <\s>
<s> you're a good fellow pendennis and you speak french like chateaubriand by jove <\s>
<s> i've been accustomed to it from my youth upwards said pen and strong had the grace not to laugh for five minutes when he exploded into fits of hilarity which pendennis has never perhaps understood up to this day <\s>
<s> it was daybreak when they got to the brawl where they separated <\s>
<s> by that time the ball at baymouth was over too <\s>
<s> madame fribsby and mirobolant were on their way home in the clavering fly laura was in bed with an easy heart and asleep at lady rockminster's and the claverings at rest at the inn at baymouth where they had quarters for the night <\s>
<s> a short time after the disturbance between pen and the chef blanche had come out of the refreshment room looking as pale as a lemon ice <\s>
<s> she told her maid having no other confidante at hand that she had met with the most romantic adventure the most singular man one who had known the author of her being her persecuted her unhappy her heroic her murdered father and she began a sonnet to his manes before she went to sleep <\s>
<s> so pen returned to fairoaks in company with his friend the chevalier without having uttered a word of the message which he had been so anxious to deliver to laura at baymouth <\s>
<s> he could wait however until her return home which was to take place on the succeeding day <\s>
<s> he was not seriously jealous of the progress made by mr <\s>
<s> pynsent in her favour and he felt pretty certain that in this as in any other family arrangement he had but to ask and have and laura like his mother could refuse him nothing <\s>
<s> when helen's anxious looks inquired of him what had happened at baymouth and whether her darling project was fulfilled pen in a gay tone told of the calamity which had befallen laughingly said that no man could think about declarations under such a mishap and made light of the matter <\s>
<s> there will be plenty of time for sentiment dear mother when laura comes back he said and he looked in the glass with a killing air and his mother put his hair off his forehead and kissed him and of course thought for her part that no woman could resist him and was exceedingly happy that day <\s>
<s> when he was not with her mr <\s>
<s> pen occupied himself in packing books and portmanteaus burning and arranging papers cleaning his gun and putting it into its case in fact in making dispositions for departure <\s>
<s> for though he was ready to marry this gentleman was eager to go to london too rightly considering that at three and twenty it was quite time for him to begin upon the serious business of life and to set about making a fortune as quickly as possible <\s>
<s> the means to this end he had already shaped out for himself <\s>
<s> i shall take chambers he said and enter myself at an inn of court <\s>
<s> with a couple of hundred pounds i shall be able to carry through the first year very well after that i have little doubt my pen will support me as it is doing with several oxbridge men now in town <\s>
<s> i have a tragedy a comedy and a novel all nearly finished and for which i can't fail to get a price <\s>
<s> and so i shall be able to live pretty well without drawing upon my poor mother until i have made my way at the bar <\s>
<s> then some day i will come back and make her dear soul happy by marrying laura <\s>
<s> she is as good and as sweet tempered a girl as ever lived besides being really very good looking and the engagement will serve to steady me won't it ponto <\s>
<s> thus smoking his pipe and talking to his dog as he sauntered through the gardens and orchards of the little domain of fairoaks this young day dreamer built castles in the air for himself yes she'll steady me won't she <\s>
<s> and you'll miss me when i've gone won't you old boy <\s>
<s> he asked of ponto who quivered his tail and thrust his brown nose into his master's fist <\s>
<s> ponto licked his hand and shoe as they all did in that house and mr <\s>
<s> pen received their homage as other folks do the flattery which they get <\s>
<s> laura came home rather late in the evening of the second day and mr <\s>
<s> pynsent as ill luck would have it drove her from clavering <\s>
<s> the poor girl could not refuse his offer but his appearance brought a dark cloud upon the brow of arthur pendennis <\s>
<s> laura saw this and was pained by it the eager widow however was aware of nothing and being anxious doubtless that the delicate question should be asked at once was for going to bed very soon after laura's arrival and rose for that purpose to leave the sofa where she now generally lay and where laura would come and sit and work or read by her <\s>
<s> but when helen rose laura said with a blush and rather an alarmed voice that she was also very tired and wanted to go to bed so that the widow was disappointed in her scheme for that night at least and mr <\s>
<s> pen was left another day in suspense regarding his fate <\s>
<s> his dignity was offended at being thus obliged to remain in the ante chamber when he wanted an audience <\s>
<s> such a sultan as he could not afford to be kept waiting <\s>
<s> however he went to bed and slept upon his disappointment pretty comfortably and did not wake until the early morning when he looked up and saw his mother standing in his room <\s>
<s> dear pen rouse up said this lady <\s>
<s> do not be lazy <\s>
<s> it is the most beautiful morning in the world <\s>
<s> i have not been able to sleep since daybreak and laura has been out for an hour <\s>
<s> she is in the garden <\s>
<s> everybody ought to be in the garden and out on such a morning as this <\s>
<s> he saw what thoughts were uppermost in the simple woman's heart <\s>
<s> his good natured laughter cheered the widow <\s>
<s> oh you profound dissembler he said kissing his mother <\s>
<s> oh you artful creature <\s>
<s> can nobody escape from your wicked tricks <\s>
<s> and will you make your only son your victim <\s>
<s> helen too laughed she blushed she fluttered and was agitated <\s>
<s> she was as happy as she could be a good tender matchmaking woman the dearest project of whose heart was about to be accomplished <\s>
<s> so after exchanging some knowing looks and hasty words helen left arthur and this young hero rising from his bed proceeded to decorate his beautiful person and shave his ambrosial chin and in half an hour he issued out from his apartment into the garden in quest of laura <\s>
<s> his reflections as he made his toilette were rather dismal <\s>
<s> i am going to tie myself for life he thought to please my mother <\s>
<s> laura is the best of women and and she has given me her money <\s>
<s> i wish to heaven i had not received it i wish i had not this duty to perform just yet <\s>
<s> but as both the women have set their hearts on the match why i suppose i must satisfy them and now for it <\s>
<s> a man may do worse than make happy two of the best creatures in the world <\s>
<s> so pen now he was actually come to the point felt very grave and by no means elated and indeed thought it was a great sacrifice he was going to perform <\s>
<s> it was miss laura's custom upon her garden excursions to wear a sort of uniform which though homely was thought by many people to be not unbecoming <\s>
<s> she had a large straw hat with a streamer of broad ribbon which was useless probably but the hat sufficiently protected the owner's pretty face from the sun <\s>
<s> over her accustomed gown she wore a blouse or pinafore which being fastened round her little waist by a smart belt looked extremely well and her bands were guaranteed from the thorns of her favourite rose bushes by a pair of gauntlets which gave this young lady a military and resolute air <\s>
<s> somehow she had the very same smile with which she had laughed at him on the night previous and the recollection of his disaster again offended pen <\s>
<s> but laura though she saw him coming down the walk looking so gloomy and full of care accorded to him a smile of the most perfect and provoking good humour and went to meet him holding one of the gauntlets to him so that he might shake it if he liked and mr <\s>
<s> pen condescended to do so <\s>
<s> his face however did not lose its tragic expression in consequence of this favour and he continued to regard her with a dismal and solemn air <\s>
<s> excuse my glove said laura with a laugh pressing pen's hand kindly with it <\s>
<s> we are not angry again are we pen <\s>
<s> why do you laugh at me <\s>
<s> you did the other night and made a fool of me to the people at baymouth <\s>
<s> my dear arthur i meant you no wrong the girl answered <\s>
<s> you and miss roundle looked so droll as you as you met with your little accident that i could not make a tragedy of it <\s>
<s> dear pen it wasn't a serious fall <\s>
<s> and besides it was miss roundle who was the most unfortunate <\s>
<s> confound miss roundle bellowed out pen <\s>
<s> i'm sure she looked so said laura archly <\s>
<s> you were up in an instant but that poor lady sitting on the ground in her red crape dress and looking about her with that piteous face can i ever forget her and laura began to make a face in imitation of miss roundle's under the disaster but she checked herself repentantly saying well we must not laugh at her but i am sure we ought to laugh at you pen if you were angry about such a trifle <\s>
<s> you should not laugh at me laura said pen with some bitterness not you of all people <\s>
<s> are you such a great man <\s>
<s> ah no laura i'm such a poor one pen answered <\s>
<s> haven't you baited me enough already <\s>
<s> my dear pen and how <\s>
<s> indeed indeed i didn't think to vex you by such a trifle <\s>
<s> i thought such a clever man as you could bear a harmless little joke from his sister she said holding her hand out again <\s>
<s> dear arthur if i have hurt you i beg your pardon <\s>
<s> it is your kindness that humiliates me more even than your laughter laura pen said <\s>
<s> you are always my superior <\s>
<s> superior to the great arthur pendennis <\s>
<s> how can it be possible <\s>
<s> said miss laura who may have had a little wickedness as well as a great deal of kindness in her composition <\s>
<s> you can't mean that any woman is your equal <\s>
<s> those who confer benefits should not sneer said pen <\s>
<s> i don't like my benefactor to laugh at me laura it makes the obligation very hard to bear <\s>
<s> you scorn me because i have taken your money and i am worthy to be scorned but the blow is hard coming from you <\s>
<s> for shame pen this is ungenerous laura said flushing red <\s>
<s> may not our mother claim everything that belongs to us <\s>
<s> don't i owe her all my happiness in this world arthur <\s>
<s> what matters about a few paltry guineas if we can set her tender heart at rest and ease her mind regarding you <\s>
<s> i would dig in the fields i would go out and be a servant i would die for her <\s>
<s> you know i would said miss laura kindling up and you call this paltry money an obligation <\s>
<s> oh pen it's cruel it's unworthy of you to take it so <\s>
<s> if my brother may not share with me my superfluity who may mine i tell you it was not mine it was all mamma's to do with as she chose and so is everything i have said laura my life is hers <\s>
<s> and the enthusiastic girl looked towards the windows of the widow's room and blessed in her heart the kind creature within <\s>
<s> helen was looking unseen out of that window towards which laura's eyes and heart were turned as she spoke and was watching her two children with the deepest interest and emotion longing and hoping that the prayer of her life might be fulfilled and if laura had spoken as helen hoped who knows what temptations arthur pendennis might have been spared or what different trials he would have had to undergo <\s>
<s> he might have remained at fairoaks all his days and died a country gentleman <\s>
<s> but would he have escaped then <\s>
<s> temptation is an obsequious servant that has no objection to the country and we know that it takes up its lodging in hermitages as well as in cities and that in the most remote and inaccessible desert it keeps company with the fugitive solitary <\s>
<s> is your life my mother's <\s>
<s> said pen beginning to tremble and speak in a very agitated manner <\s>
<s> you know laura what the great object of hers is <\s>
<s> and he took her hand once more <\s>
<s> she said dropping it and looking at him at the window again and then dropping her eyes to the ground so that they avoided pen's gaze <\s>
<s> she too trembled for she felt that the crisis for which she had been secretly preparing was come <\s>
<s> our mother has one wish above all others in the world laura pen said and i think you know it <\s>
<s> i own to you that she has spoken to me of it and if you will fulfil it dear sister i am ready <\s>
<s> i am but very young as yet but i have had so many pains and disappointments that i am old and weary <\s>
<s> i think i have hardly got a heart to offer <\s>
<s> before i have almost begun the race in life i am a tired man <\s>
<s> my career has been a failure i have been protected by those whom i by right should have protected <\s>
<s> i own that your nobleness and generosity dear laura shame me whilst they render me grateful <\s>
<s> when i heard from our mother what you had done for me that it was you who armed me and bade me go out for one struggle more i longed to go and throw myself at your feet and say laura will you come and share the contest with me <\s>
<s> your sympathy will cheer me while it lasts <\s>
<s> i shall have one of the tenderest and most generous creatures under heaven to aid and bear me company <\s>
<s> will you take me dear laura and make our mother happy <\s>
<s> do you think mamma would be happy if you were otherwise arthur <\s>
<s> laura said in a low sad voice <\s>
<s> and why should i not be asked pen eagerly with so dear a creature as you by my side <\s>
<s> i have not my first love to give you <\s>
<s> i am a broken man <\s>
<s> but indeed i would love you fondly and truly <\s>
<s> i have lost many an illusion and ambition but i am not without hope still <\s>
<s> talents i know i have wretchedly as i have misapplied them they may serve me yet they would had i a motive for action <\s>
<s> let me go away and think that i am pledged to return to you <\s>
<s> let me go and work and hope that you will share my success if i gain it <\s>
<s> you have given me so much laura dear will you take from me nothing <\s>
<s> what have you got to give arthur <\s>
<s> laura said with a grave sadness of tone which made pen start and see that his words had committed him <\s>
<s> indeed his declaration had not been such as he would have made it two days earlier when full of hope and gratitude he had run over to laura his liberatress to thank her for his recovered freedom <\s>
<s> had he been permitted to speak then he had spoken and she perhaps had listened differently <\s>
<s> it would have been a grateful heart asking for hers not a weary one offered to her to take or to leave <\s>
<s> laura was offended with the terms in which pen offered himself to her <\s>
<s> he had in fact said that he had no love and yet would take no denial <\s>
<s> i give myself to you to please my mother he had said take me as she wishes that i should make this sacrifice <\s>
<s> the girl's spirit would brook a husband under no such conditions she was not minded to run forward because pen chose to hold out the handkerchief and her tone in reply to arthur showed her determination to be independent <\s>
<s> no arthur she said our marriage would not make mamma happy as she fancies for it would not content you very long <\s>
<s> i too have known what her wishes were for she is too open to conceal anything she has at heart and once perhaps i thought but that is over now that i could have made you that it might have been as she wished <\s>
<s> you have seen somebody else said pen angry at her tone and recalling the incidents of the past days <\s>
<s> that allusion might have been spared laura replied flinging up her head <\s>
<s> a heart which has worn out love at three and twenty as yours has you say should have survived jealousy too <\s>
<s> i do not condescend to say whether i have seen or encouraged any other person <\s>
<s> i shall neither admit the charge nor deny it and beg you also to allude to it no more <\s>
<s> i ask your pardon laura if i have offended you but if i am jealous does it not prove that i have a heart <\s>
<s> not for me arthur <\s>
<s> perhaps you think you love me now but it is only for an instant and because you are foiled <\s>
<s> were there no obstacle you would feel no ardour to overcome it <\s>
<s> no arthur you don't love me <\s>
<s> you would weary of me in three months as as you do of most things and mamma seeing you tired of me would be more unhappy than at my refusal to be yours <\s>
<s> let us be brother and sister arthur as heretofore but no more <\s>
<s> you will get over this little disappointment <\s>
<s> i will try said arthur in a great indignation <\s>
<s> have you not tried before <\s>
<s> laura said with some anger for she had been angry with arthur for a very long time and was now determined i suppose to speak her mind <\s>
<s> and the next time arthur when you offer yourself to a woman do not say as you have done to me i have no heart i do not love you but i am ready to marry you because my mother wishes for the match <\s>
<s> we require more than this in return for our love that is i think so <\s>
<s> i have had no experience hitherto and have not had the the practice which you supposed me to have when you spoke but now of my having seen somebody else <\s>
<s> did you tell your first love that you had no heart arthur <\s>
<s> or your second that you did not love her but that she might have you if she liked <\s>
<s> what what do you mean <\s>
<s> asked arthur blushing and still in great wrath <\s>
<s> i mean blanche amory arthur pendennis laura said proudly <\s>
<s> it is but two months since you were sighing at her feet making poems to her placing them in hollow trees by the river side <\s>
<s> i watched you that is she showed them to me <\s>
<s> neither one nor the other were in earnest perhaps but it is too soon now arthur to begin a new attachment <\s>
<s> go through the time of your your widowhood at least and do not think of marrying until you are out of mourning here the girl's eyes filled with tears and she passed her hand across them i am angry and hurt and i have no right to be so and i ask your pardon in my turn now dear arthur <\s>
<s> you had a right to love blanche <\s>
<s> she was a thousand times prettier and more accomplished than than any girl near us here and you not could know that she had no heart and so you were right to leave her too <\s>
<s> i ought not to rebuke you about blanche amory and because she deceived you <\s>
<s> pardon me pen and she held the kind hand out to pen once more <\s>
<s> we were both jealous said pen <\s>
<s> dear laura let us both forgive and he seized her band and would have drawn her towards him <\s>
<s> he thought that she was relenting and already assumed the airs of a victor <\s>
<s> but she shrank back and her tears passed away and she fixed on him a look so melancholy and severe that the young man in his turn shrank before it <\s>
<s> do not mistake me arthur she said it cannot be <\s>
<s> you do not know what you ask and do not be too angry with me for saying that i think you do not deserve it <\s>
<s> what do you offer in exchange to a woman for her love honour and obedience <\s>
<s> if ever i say these words dear pen i hope to say them in earnest and by the blessing of god to keep my vow <\s>
<s> but you what tie binds you <\s>
<s> you do not care about many things which we poor women hold sacred i do not like to think or ask how far your incredulity leads you <\s>
<s> you offer to marry to please our mother and own that you have no heart to give away <\s>
<s> oh arthur what is it you offer me <\s>
<s> what a rash compact would you enter into so lightly <\s>
<s> a month ago and you would have given yourself to another <\s>
<s> i pray you do not trifle with your own or others hearts so recklessly <\s>
<s> go and work go and mend dear arthur for i see your faults and dare speak of them now go and get fame as you say that you can and i will pray for my brother and watch our dearest mother at home <\s>
<s> is that your final decision laura <\s>
<s> yes said laura bowing her head and once more giving him her hand she went away <\s>
<s> he saw her pass under the creepers of the little porch and disappear into the house <\s>
<s> the curtains of his mother's window fell at the same minute but he did not mark that or suspect that helen had been witnessing the scene <\s>
<s> was he pleased or was he angry at its termination <\s>
<s> he had asked her and a secret triumph filled his heart to think that he was still free <\s>
<s> she had refused him but did she not love him <\s>
<s> that avowal of jealousy made him still think that her heart was his own whatever her lips might utter <\s>
<s> and now we ought perhaps to describe another scene which took place at fairoaks between the widow and laura when the latter had to tell helen that she had refused arthur pendennis <\s>
<s> perhaps it was the hardest task of all which laura had to go through in this matter and the one which gave her the most pain <\s>
<s> but as we do not like to see a good woman unjust we shall not say a word more of the quarrel which now befell between helen and her adopted daughter or of the bitter tears which the poor girl was made to shed <\s>
<s> it was the only difference which she and the widow had ever had as yet and the more cruel from this cause <\s>
<s> pen left home whilst it was as yet pending and helen who could pardon almost everything could not pardon an act of justice in laura <\s>
<s> babylon our reader must now please to quit the woods and sea shore of the west and the gossip of clavering and the humdrum life of poor little fairoaks and transport himself with arthur pendennis on the alacrity coach to london whither he goes once for all to face the world and to make his fortune <\s>
<s> as the coach whirls through the night away from the friendly gates of home many a plan does the young man cast in his mind of future life and conduct prudence and peradventure success and fame <\s>
<s> he knows he is a better man than many who have hitherto been ahead of him in the race his first failure has caused him remorse and brought with it reflection it has not taken away his courage or let us add his good opinion of himself <\s>
<s> a hundred eager fancies and busy hopes keep him awake <\s>
<s> how much older his mishaps and a year's thought and self communion have made him than when twelve months since he passed on this road on his way to and from oxbridge <\s>
<s> his thoughts turn in the night with inexpressible fondness and tenderness towards the fond mother who blessed him when parting and who in spite of all his past faults and follies trusts him and loves him still <\s>
<s> blessings be on her <\s>
<s> he prays as he looks up to the stars overhead <\s>
<s> give him strength to work to endure to be honest to avoid temptation to be worthy of the loving soul who loves him so entirely <\s>
<s> very likely she is awake too at that moment and sending up to the same father purer prayers than his for the welfare of her boy <\s>
<s> that woman's love is a talisman by which he holds and hopes to get his safety <\s>
<s> and laura's he would have fain carried her affection with him too but she has denied it as he is not worthy of it <\s>
<s> he owns as much with shame and remorse confesses how much better and loftier her nature is than his own confesses it and yet is glad to be free <\s>
<s> i am not good enough for such a creature he owns to himself <\s>
<s> he draws back before her spotless beauty and innocence as from something that scares him <\s>
<s> he feels he is not fit for such a mate as that as many a wild prodigal who has been pious and guiltless in early days keeps away from a church which he used to frequent once shunning it but not hostile to it only feeling that he has no right in that pure place <\s>
<s> with these thoughts to occupy him pen did not fall asleep until the nipping dawn of an october morning and woke considerably refreshed when the coach stopped at the old breakfasting place at b where he had had a score of merry meals on his way to and from school and college many times since he was a boy <\s>
<s> as they left that place the sun broke out brightly the pace was rapid the horn blew the milestones flew by pen smoked and joked with guard and fellow passengers and people along the familiar road it grew more busy and animated at every instant the last team of greys came out at h and the coach drove into london <\s>
<s> what young fellow has not felt a thrill as he entered the vast place <\s>
<s> hundreds of other carriages crowded with their thousands of men were hastening to the great city <\s>
<s> here is my place thought pen here is my battle beginning in which i must fight and conquer or fall <\s>
<s> i have been a boy and a dawdler as yet <\s>
<s> oh i long i long to show that i can be a man <\s>
<s> and from his place on the coach roof the eager young fellow looked down upon the city with the sort of longing desire which young soldiers feel on the eve of a campaign <\s>
<s> as they came along the road pen had formed acquaintance with a cheery fellow passenger in a shabby cloak who talked a great deal about men of letters with whom he was very familiar and who was in fact the reporter of a london newspaper as whose representative he had been to attend a great wrestling match in the west <\s>
<s> this gentleman knew intimately as it appeared all the leading men of letters of his day and talked about tom campbell and tom hood and sydney smith and this and the other as if he had been their most intimate friend <\s>
<s> as they passed by brompton this gentleman pointed out to pen mr <\s>
<s> hurtle the reviewer walking with his umbrella <\s>
<s> pen craned over the coach to have a long look at the great hurtle <\s>
<s> he was a boniface man said pen <\s>
<s> doolan of the star newspaper for such was the gentleman's name and address upon the card which he handed to pen said faith he was and he knew him very well <\s>
<s> pen thought it was quite an honour to have seen the great mr <\s>
<s> hurtle whose works he admired <\s>
<s> he believed fondly as yet in authors reviewers and editors of newspapers <\s>
<s> even wagg whose books did not appear to him to be masterpieces of human intellect he yet secretly revered as a successful writer <\s>
<s> he mentioned that he had met wagg in the country and doolan told him how that famous novelist received three hundther pounds a volume for every one of his novels <\s>
<s> pen began to calculate instantly whether he might not make five thousand a year <\s>
<s> the very first acquaintance of his own whom arthur met as the coach pulled up at the gloster coffee house was his old friend harry foker who came prancing down arlington street behind an enormous cab horse <\s>
<s> he had white kid gloves and white reins and nature had by this time decorated him with a considerable tuft on the chin <\s>
<s> a very small cab boy vice stoopid retired swung on behind foker's vehicle knock kneed and in the tightest leather breeches <\s>
<s> foker looked at the dusty coach and the smoking horses of the alacrity by which he had made journeys in former times <\s>
<s> cried out pendennis hullo <\s>
<s> said the other and he waved his whip by way of amity and salute to arthur who was very glad to see his queer friend's kind old face <\s>
<s> doolan had a great respect for pen who had an acquaintance in such a grand cab and pen was greatly excited and pleased to be at liberty and in london <\s>
<s> he asked doolan to come and dine with him at the covent garden coffee house where he put up he called a cab and rattled away thither in the highest spirits <\s>
<s> he was glad to see the bustling waiter and polite bowing landlord again and asked for the landlady and missed the old boots and would have liked to shake hands with everybody <\s>
<s> he had a hundred pounds in his pocket <\s>
<s> he dressed himself in his very best dined in the coffee room with a modest pint of sherry for he was determined to be very economical and went to the theatre adjoining <\s>
<s> the lights and the music the crowd and the gaiety charmed and exhilarated pen as those sights will do young fellows from college and the country to whom they are tolerably new <\s>
<s> he laughed at the jokes he applauded the songs to the delight of some of the dreary old habitues of the boxes who had ceased long ago to find the least excitement in their place of nightly resort and were pleased to see any one so fresh and so much amused <\s>
<s> at the end of the first piece he went and strutted about the lobbies of the theatre as if he was in a resort of the highest fashion <\s>
<s> what tired frequenter of the london pave is there that cannot remember having had similar early delusions and would not call them back again <\s>
<s> here was young foker again like an ardent votary of pleasure as he was <\s>
<s> he was walking with grandy tiptoff of the household brigade lord tiptoff's brother and lord colchicum captain tiptoff's uncle a venerable peer who had been a man of pleasure since the first french revolution <\s>
<s> foker rushed upon pen with eagerness and insisted that the latter should come into his private box where a lady with the longest ringlets and the fairest shoulders was seated <\s>
<s> this was miss blenkinsop the eminent actress of high comedy and in the back of the box snoozing in a wig sate old blenkinsop her papa <\s>
<s> he was described in the theatrical prints as the veteran blenkinsop the useful blenkinsop that old favourite of the public blenkinsop those parts in the drama which are called the heavy fathers were usually assigned to this veteran who indeed acted the heavy father in public as in private life <\s>
<s> at this time it being about eleven o'clock mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis was gone to bed at fairoaks and wondering whether her dearest arthur was at rest after his journey <\s>
<s> at this time laura too was awake <\s>
<s> and at this time yesterday night as the coach rolled over silent commons where cottage windows twinkled and by darkling woods under calm starlit skies pen was vowing to reform and to resist temptation and his heart was at home <\s>
<s> meanwhile the farce was going on very successfully and mrs <\s>
<s> leary in a hussar jacket and braided pantaloons was enchanting the audience with her archness her lovely figure and her delightful ballads <\s>
<s> pen being new to the town would have liked to listen to mrs <\s>
<s> leary but the other people in the box did not care about her song or her pantaloons and kept up an incessant chattering <\s>
<s> tiptoff knew where her maillots came from <\s>
<s> colchicum saw her when she came out in 14 <\s>
<s> miss blenkinsop said she sang out of all tune to the pain and astonishment of pen who thought that she was as beautiful as an angel and that she sang like a nightingale and when hoppus came on as sir harcourt featherby the young man of the piece the gentlemen in the box declared that hoppus was getting too stale and tiptoff was for flinging miss blenkinsop's bouquet to him <\s>
<s> not for the world cried the daughter of the veteran blenkinsop lord colchicum gave it to me <\s>
<s> pen remembered that nobleman's name and with a bow and a blush said he believed he had to thank lord colchicum for having proposed him at the megatherium club at the request of his uncle major pendennis <\s>
<s> what you're wigsby's nephew are you <\s>
<s> i beg your pardon we always call him wigsby <\s>
<s> pen blushed to hear his venerable uncle called by such a familiar name <\s>
<s> we balloted you in last week didn't we <\s>
<s> yes last wednesday night <\s>
<s> your uncle wasn't there <\s>
<s> here was delightful news for pen <\s>
<s> he professed himself very much obliged indeed to lord colchicum and made him a handsome speech of thanks to which the other listened with his double opera glass up to his eyes <\s>
<s> pen was full of excitement at the idea of being a member of this polite club <\s>
<s> don't be always looking at that box you naughty creature cried miss blenkinsop <\s>
<s> she's a dev'lish fine woman that mirabel said tiptoff though mirabel was a d  d fool to marry her <\s>
<s> a stupid old spooney said the peer <\s>
<s> laughed out harry foker <\s>
<s> we've heard of her before haven't we pen <\s>
<s> it was pen's first love <\s>
<s> it was miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> the year before she had been led to the altar by sir charles mirabel g c b and formerly envoy to the court of pumpernickel who had taken so active a part in the negotiations before the congress of swammerdam and signed on behalf of h b m the peace of pultusk <\s>
<s> emily was always as stupid as an owl said miss blenkinsop <\s>
<s> pas si bete the old peer said <\s>
<s> cried the actress who did not in the least know what he meant <\s>
<s> and pen looked out and beheld his first love once again and wondered how he ever could have loved her <\s>
<s> thus on the very first night of his arrival in london mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis found himself introduced to a club to an actress of genteel comedy and a heavy father of the stage and to a dashing society of jovial blades old and young for my lord colchicum though stricken in years bald of head and enfeebled in person was still indefatigable in the pursuit of enjoyment and it was the venerable viscount's boast that he could drink as much claret as the youngest member of the society which he frequented <\s>
<s> he lived with the youth about town he gave them countless dinners at richmond and greenwich an enlightened patron of the drama in all languages and of the terpsichorean art he received dramatic professors of all nations at his banquets english from the covent garden and strand houses italians from the haymarket french from their own pretty little theatre or the boards of the opera where they danced <\s>
<s> and at his villa on the thames this pillar of the state gave sumptuous entertainments to scores of young men of fashion who very affably consorted with the ladies and gentlemen of the greenroom with the former chiefly for viscount colchicum preferred their society as more polished and gay than that of their male brethren <\s>
<s> pen went the next day and paid his entrance money at the club which operation carried off exactly one third of his hundred pounds and took possession of the edifice and ate his luncheon there with immense satisfaction <\s>
<s> he plunged into an easy chair in the library and tried to read all the magazines <\s>
<s> he wondered whether the members were looking at him and that they could dare to keep on their hats in such fine rooms <\s>
<s> he sate down and wrote a letter to fairoaks on the club paper and said what a comfort this place would be to him after his day's work was over <\s>
<s> he went over to his uncle's lodgings in bury street with some considerable tremor and in compliance with his mother's earnest desire that he should instantly call on major pendennis and was not a little relieved to find that the major had not yet returned to town <\s>
<s> his apartments were blank <\s>
<s> brown hollands covered his library table and bills and letters lay on the mantelpiece grimly awaiting the return of their owner <\s>
<s> the major was on the continent the landlady of the house said at badnbadn with the marcus of steyne <\s>
<s> pen left his card upon the shelf with the rest <\s>
<s> fairoaks was written on it still <\s>
<s> when the major returned to london which he did in time for the fogs of november after enjoying which he proposed to spend christmas with some friends in the country he found another card of arthur's on which lamb court temple was engraved and a note from that young gentleman and from his mother stating that he was come to town was entered a member of the upper temple and was reading hard for the bar <\s>
<s> lamb court temple where was it <\s>
<s> major pendennis remembered that some ladies of fashion used to talk of dining with mr <\s>
<s> ayliffe the barrister who was in society and who lived there in the king's bench of which prison there was probably a branch in the temple and ayliffe was very likely an officer <\s>
<s> deuceace lord crabs's son had also lived there he recollected <\s>
<s> he despatched morgan to find out where lamb court was and to report upon the lodging selected by mr <\s>
<s> that alert messenger had little difficulty in discovering mr <\s>
<s> discreet morgan had in his time traced people far more difficult to find than arthur <\s>
<s> what sort of a place is it morgan <\s>
<s> asked the major out of the bed curtains in bury street the next morning as the valet was arranging his toilette in the deep yellow london fog <\s>
<s> i should say rayther a shy place said mr <\s>
<s> the lawyers lives there and has their names on the doors <\s>
<s> harthur lives three pair high sir <\s>
<s> warrington lives there too sir <\s>
<s> i shouldn't wonder a good family thought the major <\s>
<s> the cadets of many of our good families follow the robe as a profession <\s>
<s> honly saw the outside of the door sir with mr <\s>
<s> warrington's name and mr <\s>
<s> arthur's painted up and a piece of paper with back at 6 but i couldn't see no servant sir <\s>
<s> economical at any rate said the major <\s>
<s> nasty black staircase as ever i see <\s>
<s> wonder how a gentleman can live in such a place <\s>
<s> pray who taught you where gentlemen should or should not live morgan <\s>
<s> arthur sir is going to study for the bar sir the major said with much dignity and closed the conversation and began to array himself in the yellow fog <\s>
<s> boys will be boys the mollified uncle thought to himself <\s>
<s> he has written to me a devilish good letter <\s>
<s> colchicum says he has had him to dine and thinks him a gentlemanlike lad <\s>
<s> his mother is one of the best creatures in the world <\s>
<s> if he has sown his wild oats and will stick to his business he may do well yet <\s>
<s> think of charley mirabel the old fool marrying that flame of his <\s>
<s> he doesn't like to come here until i give him leave and puts it in a very manly nice way <\s>
<s> i was deuced angry with him after his oxbridge escapades and showed it too when he was here before gad i'll go and see him hang me if i don't <\s>
<s> and having ascertained from morgan that he could reach the temple without much difficulty and that a city omnibus would put him down at the gate the major one day after breakfast at his club not the polyanthus whereof mr <\s>
<s> pen was just elected a member but another club for the major was too wise to have a nephew as a constant inmate of any house where he was in the habit of passing his time the major one day entered one of those public vehicles and bade the conductor to put him down at the gate of the upper temple <\s>
<s> when major pendennis reached that dingy portal it was about twelve o'clock in the day and he was directed by a civil personage with a badge and a white apron through some dark alleys and under various melancholy archways into courts each more dismal than the other until finally he reached lamb court <\s>
<s> if it was dark in pall mail what was it in lamb court <\s>
<s> candles were burning in many of the rooms there in the pupil room of mr <\s>
<s> hodgeman the special pleader where six pupils were scribbling declarations under the tallow in sir hokey walker's clerk's room where the clerk a person far more gentlemanlike and cheerful in appearance than the celebrated counsel his master was conversing in a patronising manner with the managing clerk of an attorney at the door and in curling the wigmaker's melancholy shop where from behind the feeble glimmer of a couple of lights large serpents and judges wigs were looming drearily with the blank blocks looking at the lamp post in the court <\s>
<s> two little clerks were playing at toss halfpenny under that lamp <\s>
<s> a laundress in pattens passed in at one door a newspaper boy issued from another <\s>
<s> a porter whose white apron was faintly visible paced up and down <\s>
<s> it would be impossible to conceive a place more dismal and the major shuddered to think that any one should select such a residence <\s>
<s> he said the poor boy mustn't live on here <\s>
<s> the feeble and filthy oil lamps with which the staircases of the upper temple are lighted of nights were of course not illuminating the stairs by day and major pendennis having read with difficulty his nephew's name under mr <\s>
<s> warrington's on the wall of no <\s>
<s> 6 found still greater difficulty in climbing the abominable black stairs up the banisters of which which contributed their damp exudations to his gloves he groped painfully until he came to the third story <\s>
<s> a candle was in the passage of one of the two sets of rooms the doors were open and the names of mr <\s>
<s> pendennis were very clearly visible to the major as he went in <\s>
<s> an irish charwoman with a pail and broom opened the door for the major <\s>
<s> is that the beer <\s>
<s> cried out a great voice give us hold of it <\s>
<s> the gentleman who was speaking was seated on a table unshorn and smoking a short pipe in a farther chair sate pen with a cigar and his legs near the fire <\s>
<s> a little boy who acted as the clerk of these gentlemen was grinning in the major's face at the idea of his being mistaken for beer <\s>
<s> here upon the third floor the rooms were somewhat lighter and the major could see place <\s>
<s> pen my boy it's i it's your uncle he said choking with the smoke <\s>
<s> but as most young men of fashion used the weed he pardoned the practice easily enough <\s>
<s> warrington got up from the table and pen in a very perturbed manner from his chair <\s>
<s> beg your pardon for mistaking you said warrington in a frank loud voice <\s>
<s> will you take a cigar sir <\s>
<s> clear those things off the chair pidgeon and pull it round to the fire <\s>
<s> pen flung his cigar into the grate and was pleased with the cordiality with which his uncle shook him by the hand <\s>
<s> as soon as he could speak for the stairs and the smoke the major began to ask pen very kindly about himself and about his mother for blood is blood and he was pleased once more to see the boy <\s>
<s> pen gave his news and then introduced mr <\s>
<s> warrington an old boniface man whose chambers he shared <\s>
<s> the major was quite satisfied when he heard that mr <\s>
<s> warrington was a younger son of sir miles warrington of suffolk <\s>
<s> he had served with an uncle of his in india and in new south wales years ago <\s>
<s> took a sheep farm there sir made a fortune better thing than law or soldiering warrington said <\s>
<s> think i shall go there too <\s>
<s> and here the expected beer coming in in a tankard with a glass bottom mr <\s>
<s> warrington with a laugh said he supposed the major would not have any and took a long deep draught himself after which he wiped his wrist across his beard with great satisfaction <\s>
<s> the young man was perfectly easy and unembarrassed <\s>
<s> he was dressed in a ragged old shooting jacket and had a bristly blue beard <\s>
<s> he was drinking beer like a coalheaver and yet you couldn't but perceive that he was a gentleman <\s>
<s> when he had sate for a minute or two after his draught he went out of the room leaving it to pen and his uncle that they might talk over family affairs were they so inclined <\s>
<s> rough and ready your chum seems the major said <\s>
<s> somewhat different from your dandy friends at oxbridge <\s>
<s> times are altered arthur replied with a blush <\s>
<s> warrington is only just called and has no business but he knows law pretty well and until i can afford to read with a pleader i use his books and get his help <\s>
<s> is that one of the books <\s>
<s> the major asked with a smile <\s>
<s> a french novel was lying at the foot of pen's chair <\s>
<s> this is not a working day sir the lad said <\s>
<s> we were out very late at a party last night at lady whiston's pen added knowing his uncle's weakness <\s>
<s> everybody in town was there except you sir counts ambassadors turks stars and garters i don't know who it's all in the paper and my name too said pen with great glee <\s>
<s> i met an old flame of mine there sir he added with a laugh <\s>
<s> you know whom i mean sir lady mirabel to whom i was introduced over again <\s>
<s> she shook hands and was gracious enough <\s>
<s> i may thank you for being out of that scrape sir <\s>
<s> she presented me to the husband too an old beau in a star and a blonde wig <\s>
<s> he does not seem very wise <\s>
<s> she has asked me to call on her sir and i may go now without any fear of losing my heart <\s>
<s> what we have had some new loves have we <\s>
<s> the major asked in high good humour <\s>
<s> some two or three mr <\s>
<s> but i don't put on my grand serieux any more sir <\s>
<s> that goes off after the first flame <\s>
<s> very right my dear boy <\s>
<s> flames and darts and passion and that sort of thing do very well for a lad and you were but a lad when that affair with the fotheringill fotheringay what's her name came off <\s>
<s> but a man of the world gives up those follies <\s>
<s> you still may do very well <\s>
<s> you have been bit but you may recover <\s>
<s> you are heir to a little independence which everybody fancies is a doosid deal more <\s>
<s> you have a good name good wits good manners and a good person and begad <\s>
<s> i don't see why you shouldn't marry a woman with money get into parliament distinguish yourself and and in fact that sort of thing <\s>
<s> remember it's as easy to marry a rich woman as a poor woman and a devilish deal pleasanter to sit down to a good dinner than to a scrag of mutton in lodgings <\s>
<s> make up your mind to that <\s>
<s> a woman with a good jointure is a doosid deal easier a profession than the law let me tell you that <\s>
<s> look out i shall be on the watch for you and i shall die content my boy if i can see you with a good ladylike wife and a good carriage and a good pair of horses living in society and seeing your friends like a gentleman <\s>
<s> would you like to vegetate like your dear good mother at fairoaks <\s>
<s> life without money and the best society isn't worth having <\s>
<s> it was thus this affectionate uncle spoke and expounded to pen his simple philosophy <\s>
<s> what would my mother and laura say to this i wonder <\s>
<s> indeed old pendennis's morals were not their morals nor was his wisdom theirs <\s>
<s> this affecting conversation between uncle and nephew had scarcely concluded when warrington came out of his bedroom no longer in rags but dressed like a gentleman straight and tall and perfectly frank and good humoured <\s>
<s> he did the honours of his ragged sitting room with as much ease as if it had been the finest apartment in london <\s>
<s> and queer rooms they were in which the major found his nephew <\s>
<s> the carpet was full of holes the table stained with many circles of warrington's previous ale pots <\s>
<s> there was a small library of law books books of poetry and of mathematics of which he was very fond <\s>
<s> he had been one of the hardest livers and hardest readers of his time at oxbridge where the name of stunning warrington was yet famous for beating bargemen pulling matches winning prizes and drinking milk punch a print of the old college hung up over the mantelpiece and some battered volumes of plato bearing its well known arms were on the book shelves <\s>
<s> there were two easy chairs a standing reading desk piled with bills a couple of very meagre briefs on a broken legged study table <\s>
<s> indeed there was scarcely any article of furniture that had not been in the wars and was not wounded <\s>
<s> look here sir here is pen's room <\s>
<s> he is a dandy and has got curtains to his bed and wears shiny boots and a silver dressing case <\s>
<s> indeed pen's room was rather coquettishly arranged and a couple of neat prints of opera dancers besides a drawing of fairoaks hung on the walls <\s>
<s> in warrington's room there was scarcely any article of furniture save a great shower bath and a heap of books by the bedside where he lay upon straw like margery daw and smoked his pipe and read half through the night his favourite poetry or mathematics <\s>
<s> when he had completed his simple toilette mr <\s>
<s> warrington came out of this room and proceeded to the cupboard to search for his breakfast <\s>
<s> might i offer you a mutton chop sir <\s>
<s> we cook em ourselves hot and hot and i am teaching pen the first principles of law cooking and morality at the same time <\s>
<s> he's a lazy beggar sir and too much of a dandy <\s>
<s> and so saying mr <\s>
<s> warrington wiped a gridiron with a piece of paper put it on the fire and on it two mutton chops and took from the cupboard a couple of plates and some knives and silver forks and castors <\s>
<s> say but a word major pendennis he said there's another chop in the cupboard or pidgeon shall go out and get you anything you like <\s>
<s> major pendennis sate in wonder and amusement but he said he had just breakfasted and wouldn't have any lunch <\s>
<s> so warrington cooked the chops and popped them hissing hot upon the plates <\s>
<s> pen fell to at his chop with a good appetite after looking up at his uncle and seeing that gentleman was still in good humour <\s>
<s> you see sir warrington said mrs <\s>
<s> flanagan isn't here to do em and we can't employ the boy for the little beggar is all day occupied cleaning pen's boots <\s>
<s> and now for another swig at the beer <\s>
<s> pen drinks tea it's only fit for old women <\s>
<s> and so you were at lady whiston's last night the major said not in truth knowing what observation to make to this rough diamond <\s>
<s> i at lady whiston's <\s>
<s> not such a flat sir <\s>
<s> i don't care for female society <\s>
<s> in fact it bores me <\s>
<s> i spent my evening philosophically at the back kitchen <\s>
<s> i see you don't know what it means warrington said <\s>
<s> he was there after lady whiston's <\s>
<s> tell major pendennis about the back kitchen pen don't be ashamed of yourself <\s>
<s> so pen said it was a little eccentric society of men of letters and men about town to which he had been presented and the major began to think that the young fellow had seen a good deal of the world since his arrival in london <\s>
<s> the knights of the temple colleges schools and inns of courts still have some respect for antiquity and maintain a great number of the customs and institutions of our ancestors with which those persons who do not particularly regard their forefathers or perhaps are not very well acquainted with them have long since done away <\s>

<s> among his comrades of the student class there were gentlemen of all ages from sixty to seventeen stout grey headed attorneys who were proceeding to take the superior dignity dandies and men about town who wished for some reason to be barristers of seven years standing swarthy black eyed natives of the colonies who came to be called here before they practised in their own islands and many gentlemen of the irish nation who make a sojourn in middle temple lane before they return to the green country of their birth <\s>

<s> you won't have any port <\s>
<s> don't like port with your dinner <\s>
<s> and this worthy man found himself not the less attached to pendennis because the latter disliked port wine at dinner <\s>
<s> it was while pen was taking his share of one of these dinners with his acquaintance lowton as the captain of his mess that there came to join them a gentleman in a barrister's gown who could not find a seat as it appeared amongst the persons of his own degree and who strode over the table and took his place on the bench where pen sate <\s>
<s> he was dressed in old clothes and a faded gown which hung behind him and he wore a shirt which though clean was extremely ragged and very different to the magnificent pink raiment of mr <\s>

<s> in order to notify their appearance at dinner it is the custom of the gentlemen who eat in the upper temple hall to write down their names upon slips of paper which are provided for that purpose with a pencil for each mess <\s>
<s> lowton wrote his name first then came arthur pendennis and the next was that of the gentleman in the old clothes <\s>

<s> we ought to know each other he said <\s>
<s> we're both boniface men my name's warrington <\s>

<s> pen said delighted to see this hero <\s>
<s> warrington laughed stunning warrington yes he said i recollect you in your freshman's term <\s>
<s> but you appear to have quite cut me out <\s>

<s> the bargeman you thrashed bill simes don't you remember wants you up again at oxbridge <\s>
<s> the miss notleys the haberdashers hush <\s>
<s> said warrington glad to make your acquaintance pendennis <\s>

<s> the young men were friends immediately and at once deep in college talk <\s>
<s> and pen who had been acting rather the fine gentleman on a previous day when he pretended to lowton that he could not drink port wine at dinner seeing warrington take his share with a great deal of gusto did not scruple about helping himself any more rather to the disappointment of honest lowton <\s>
<s> when the dinner was over warrington asked arthur where he was going <\s>
<s> i thought of going home to dress and hear grisi in norma pen said <\s>
<s> are you going to meet anybody there <\s>
<s> pen said no only to hear the music of which he was fond <\s>
<s> you had much better come home and smoke a pipe with me said warrington a very short one <\s>
<s> come i live close by in lamb court and we'll talk over boniface and old times <\s>
<s> they went away lowton sighed after them <\s>
<s> he knew warrington was a baronet's son and he looked up with simple reverence to all the aristocracy <\s>
<s> pen and warrington became sworn friends from that night <\s>
<s> warrington's cheerfulness and jovial temper his good sense his rough welcome and his never failing pipe of tobacco charmed pen who found it more pleasant to dive into shilling taverns with him than to dine in solitary state amongst the silent and polite frequenters of the polyanthus <\s>
<s> ere long pen gave up the lodgings in st <\s>
<s> james's to which he had migrated on quitting his hotel and found it was much more economical to take up his abode with warrington in lamb court and furnish and occupy his friend's vacant room there <\s>
<s> for it must be said of pen that no man was more easily led than he to do a thing when it was a novelty or when he had a mind to it <\s>
<s> and pidgeon the youth and flanagan the laundress divided their allegiance now between warrington and pen <\s>
<s> old and new acquaintances elated with the idea of seeing life pen went into a hundred queer london haunts <\s>
<s> he liked to think he was consorting with all sorts of men so he beheld coalheavers in their tap rooms boxers in their inn parlours honest citizens disporting in the suburbs or on the river and he would have liked to hob and nob with celebrated pickpockets or drink a pot of ale with a company of burglars and cracksmen had chance afforded him an opportunity of making the acquaintance of this class of society <\s>
<s> it was good to see the gravity with which warrington listened to the tutbury pet or the brighton stunner at the champion's arms and behold the interest which he took in the coalheaving company assembled at the fox under the hill <\s>
<s> his acquaintance with the public houses of the metropolis and its neighbourhood and with the frequenters of their various parlours was prodigious <\s>
<s> he was the personal friend of the landlord and landlady and welcome to the bar as to the clubroom <\s>
<s> he liked their society he said better than that of his own class whose manners annoyed him and whose conversation bored him <\s>
<s> in society he used to say everybody is the same wears the same dress eats and drinks and says the same things one young dandy at the club talks and looks just like another one miss at a ball exactly resembles another whereas there's character here <\s>
<s> i like to talk with the strongest man in england or the man who can drink the most beer in england or with that tremendous republican of a hatter who thinks thistlewood was the greatest character in history <\s>
<s> i like better gin and water than claret <\s>
<s> i like a sanded floor in carnaby market better than a chalked one in mayfair <\s>
<s> i prefer snobs i own it <\s>
<s> indeed this gentleman was a social republican and it never entered his head while conversing with jack and tom that he was in any respect their better although perhaps the deference which they paid him might secretly please him <\s>
<s> pen followed him then to these various resorts of men with great glee and assiduity <\s>
<s> but he was considerably younger and therefore much more pompous and stately than warrington in fact a young prince in disguise visiting the poor of his father's kingdom <\s>
<s> they respected him as a high chap a fine fellow a regular young swell <\s>
<s> he had somehow about him an air of imperious good humour and a royal frankness and majesty although he was only heir apparent to twopence halfpenny and but one in descent from a gallypot <\s>
<s> if these positions are made for us we acquiesce in them very easily and are always pretty ready to assume a superiority over those who are as good as ourselves <\s>
<s> pen's condescension at this time of his life was a fine thing to witness <\s>
<s> amongst men of ability this assumption and impertinence passes off with extreme youth but it is curious to watch the conceit of a generous and clever lad there is something almost touching in that early exhibition of simplicity and folly <\s>
<s> so after reading pretty hard of a morning and i fear not law merely but politics and general history and literature which were as necessary for the advancement and instruction of a young man as mere dry law after applying with tolerable assiduity to letters to reviews to elemental books of law and above all to the newspaper until the hour of dinner was drawing nigh these young gentlemen would sally out upon the town with great spirits and appetite and bent upon enjoying a merry night as they had passed a pleasant forenoon <\s>
<s> it was a jovial time that of four and twenty when every muscle of mind and body was in healthy action when the world was new as yet and one moved over it spurred onwards by good spirits and the delightful capability to enjoy <\s>
<s> if ever we feel young afterwards it is with the comrades of that time the tunes we hum in our old age are those we learned then <\s>
<s> sometimes perhaps the festivity of that period revives in our memory but how dingy the pleasure garden has grown how tattered the garlands look how scant and old the company and what a number of the lights have gone out since that day <\s>
<s> grey hairs have come on like daylight streaming in daylight and a headache with it <\s>
<s> pleasure has gone to bed with the rouge on her cheeks <\s>
<s> well friend let us walk through the day sober and sad but friendly <\s>

<s> our young prince of fairoaks never could speak to one of the sex but with respectful courtesy and shrank from a coarse word or gesture with instinctive delicacy for though we have seen him fall in love with a fool as his betters and inferiors have done and as it is probable that he did more than once in his life yet for the time of the delusion it was always as a goddess that he considered her and chose to wait upon her <\s>

<s> sir charles mirabel had not that enthusiastic attachment to his father in law of which the latter sometimes boasted although in other stages of emotion cos would inveigh with tears in his eyes against the ingratitude of the child of his bosom and the stinginess of the wealthy old man who had married her ); but the pair had acted not unkindly towards costigan had settled a small pension on him which was paid regularly and forestalled with even more regularity by poor cos and the period of the payments was always well known by his friend at the fielding's head whither the honest captain took care to repair bank notes in hand calling loudly for change in the midst of the full harmonic meeting <\s>

<s> have you any news of him and do you see him still <\s>
<s> no doubt he's very well said the captain jingling his money and whistling the air of a song 'the little doodeen' for the singing of which he was celebrated at the fielding's head <\s>
<s> me dear boy i've forgot your name again but my name's costigan jack costigan and i'd loike ye to take as many tumblers of punch in my name as ever ye loike <\s>
<s> ye know my name i'm not ashamed of it <\s>
<s> and so the captain went maundering on <\s>
<s> it's pay day with the general said mr <\s>
<s> hodgen the bass singer with whom warrington was in deep conversation and he's a precious deal more than half seas over <\s>
<s> he has already tried that little doodeen of his and broke it too just before i sang king death <\s>
<s> have you heard my new song the body snatcher mr <\s>
<s> warrington angcored at saint bartholomew's the other night composed expressly for me <\s>
<s> per'aps you or your friend would like a copy of the song sir <\s>
<s> john just ave the kyndness to and over a body snatcher ere will yer there's a portrait of me sir as i sing it as the snatcher considered rather like <\s>
<s> thank you said warrington heard it nine times know it by heart hodgen <\s>
<s> here the gentleman who presided at the pianoforte began to play upon his instrument and pen looking in the direction of the music beheld that very mr <\s>
<s> bows for whom he had been asking but now and whose existence costigan had momentarily forgotten <\s>
<s> the little old man sate before the battered piano which had injured its constitution wofully by sitting up so many nights and spoke with a voice as it were at once hoarse and faint and accompanied the singers or played with taste and grace in the intervals of the songs <\s>
<s> bows had seen and recollected pen at once when the latter came into the room and had remarked the eager warmth of the young man's recognition of costigan <\s>
<s> he now began to play an air which pen instantly remembered as one which used to be sung by the chorus of villagers in the stranger just before mrs <\s>
<s> it shook pen as he heard it <\s>
<s> he remembered how his heart used to beat as that air was played and before the divine emily made her entry <\s>
<s> nobody save arthur too any notice of old bows's playing it was scarcely heard amidst the clatter of knives and forks the calls for poached eggs and kidneys and the tramp of guests and waiters <\s>
<s> pen went up and kindly shook the player by the hand at the end of his performance and bows greeted arthur with great respect and cordiality <\s>
<s> what you haven't forgot the old tune mr <\s>
<s> he said i thought you'd remember it <\s>
<s> i take it it was the first tune of that sort you ever heard played wasn't it sir <\s>
<s> you were quite a young chap then <\s>
<s> i fear the captain's very bad to night <\s>
<s> he breaks out on a pay day and i shall have the deuce's own trouble in getting home <\s>
<s> we still hang on sir in partnership though miss em though my lady mirabel has left the firm and so you remember old times do you <\s>
<s> wasn't she a beauty sir your health and my service to you and he took a sip at the pewter measure of porter which stood by his side as he played <\s>
<s> pen had many opportunities of seeing his early acquaintance afterwards and of renewing his relations with costigan and the old musician <\s>
<s> as they sate thus in friendly colloquy men of all sorts and conditions entered and quitted the house of entertainment and pen had the pleasure of seeing as many different persons of his race as the most eager observer need desire to inspect <\s>
<s> healthy country tradesmen and farmers in london for their business came and recreated themselves with the jolly singing and suppers of the back kitchen squads of young apprentices and assistants the shutters being closed over the scene of their labours came hither for fresh air doubtless rakish young medical students gallant dashing what is called loudly dressed and must it be owned somewhat dirty were here smoking and drinking and vociferously applauding the songs young university bucks were to be found here too with that indescribable genteel simper which is only learned at the knees of alma mater and handsome young guardsmen and florid bucks from the st <\s>
<s> james's street clubs nay senators english and irish and even members of the house of peers <\s>
<s> the bass singer had made an immense hit with his song of the body snatcher and the town rushed to listen to it <\s>
<s> the curtain drew aside and mr <\s>
<s> hodgen appeared in the character of the snatcher sitting on a coffin with a flask of gin before him with a spade and a candle stuck in a skull <\s>
<s> the song was sung with a really admirable terrific humour <\s>
<s> the singer's voice went down so low that its grumbles rumbled into the hearer's awe stricken soul and in the chorus he clamped with his spade and gave a demoniac ha <\s>
<s> which caused the very glasses to quiver on the table as with terror <\s>
<s> none of the other singers not even cutts himself as that high minded man owned could stand up before the snatcher and he commonly used to retire to mrs <\s>
<s> cutts's private apartments or into the bar before that fatal song extinguished him <\s>
<s> poor cos's ditty the little doodeen which bows accompanied charmingly on the piano was sung but to a few admirers who might choose to remain after the tremendous resurrectionist chant <\s>
<s> the room was commonly emptied after that or only left in possession of a very few and persevering votaries of pleasure <\s>
<s> whilst pen and his friend were sitting here together one night or rather morning two habitues of the house entered almost together <\s>
<s> doolan whispered warrington to pen saluting these gentlemen and in the latter pen recognised his friend of the alacrity coach who could not dine with pen on the day on which the latter had invited him being compelled by his professional duties to decline dinner engagements on fridays he had stated with his compliments to mr <\s>
<s> doolan's paper the dawn was lying on the table much bestained by porter and cheek by jowl with hoolan's paper which we shall call the day the dawn was liberal the day was ultra conservative <\s>
<s> many of our journals are officered by irish gentlemen and their gallant brigade does the penning among us as their ancestors used to transact the fighting in europe and engage under many a flag to be good friends when the battle is over <\s>

<s> don't bring patsey with you mick for our georgy's got the measles said the friendly morgan and they straightway fell to talk about matters connected with their trade about the foreign mails about who was correspondent at paris and who wrote from madrid about the expense the morning journal was at in sending couriers about the circulation of the evening star and so forth <\s>
<s> warrington laughing took the dawn which was lying before him and pointed to one of the leading articles in that journal which commenced thus as rogues of note in former days who had some wicked work to perform an enemy to be put out of the way a quantity of false coin to be passed a lie to be told or a murder to be done employed a professional perjurer or assassin to do the work which they were themselves too notorious or too cowardly to execute our notorious contemporary the day engages smashers out of doors to utter forgeries against individuals and calls in auxiliary cut throats to murder the reputation of those who offend him <\s>

<s> we can convict this cowardly slave and propose to do so <\s>
<s> the charge which he has brought against lord bangbanagher because he is a liberal irish peer and against the board of poor law guardians of the bangbanagher union is etc <\s>

<s> asked morgan when the captain puts his hand to it he's a tremendous hand at a smasher <\s>
<s> he wrote the article in two hours in whew you know where while the boy was waiting <\s>
<s> our governor thinks the public don't mind a straw about these newspaper rows and has told the docthor to stop answering said the other <\s>
<s> them two talked it out together in my room <\s>
<s> the docthor would have liked a turn for he says it's such easy writing and requires no reading up of a subject but the governor put a stopper on him <\s>
<s> the taste for eloquence is going out mick said morgan <\s>

<s> that was fine writing when the docthor wrote in the phaynix and he and condy roony blazed away at each other day after day <\s>

<s> they are talking about doctor boyne and captain shandon warrington said who are the two irish controversialists of the dawn and the day dr <\s>
<s> boyne being the protestant champion and captain shandon the liberal orator <\s>
<s> they are the best friends in the world i believe in spite of their newspaper controversies and though they cry out against the english for abusing their country by jove they abuse it themselves more in a single article than we should take the pains to do in a dozen volumes <\s>
<s> how are you doolan <\s>
<s> pendennis i am delighted to have the honour of seeing ye again <\s>
<s> the night's journey on the top of the alacrity was one of the most agreeable i ever enjoyed in my life and it was your liveliness and urbanity that made the trip so charming <\s>
<s> i have often thought over that happy night sir and talked over it to mrs <\s>
<s> i have seen your elegant young friend mr <\s>
<s> foker too here sir not unfrequently <\s>
<s> he is an occasional frequenter of this hostelry and a right good one it is <\s>
<s> pendennis when i saw you i was on the tom and jerry weekly paper i have now the honour to be sub editor of the dawn one of the best written papers of the empire and he bowed very slightly to mr <\s>
<s> his speech was unctuous and measured his courtesy oriental his tone when talking with the two englishmen quite different to that with which he spoke to his comrade <\s>
<s> why the devil will the fellow compliment so <\s>
<s> growled warrington with a sneer which he hardly took the pains to suppress <\s>
<s> psha who comes here all parnassus is abroad to night here's archer <\s>
<s> we shall have some fun <\s>
<s> well archer house up <\s>
<s> i have been said archer with an air of mystery where i was wanted <\s>
<s> get me some supper john something substantial <\s>
<s> i hate your grandees who give you nothing to eat <\s>
<s> if it had been at apsley house it would have been quite different <\s>
<s> the duke knows what i like and says to the groom of the chambers martin you will have some cold beef not too much done and a pint bottle of pale ale and some brown sherry ready in my study as usual archer is coming here this evening <\s>
<s> the duke doesn't eat supper himself but he likes to see a man enjoy a hearty meal and he knows that i dine early <\s>
<s> a man can't live upon air be hanged to him <\s>
<s> let me introduce you to my friend mr <\s>
<s> pendennis warrington said with great gravity <\s>
<s> pen this is mr archer whom you have heard me talk about <\s>
<s> you must know pen's uncle the major archer you who know everybody <\s>
<s> dined with him the day before yesterday at gaunt house archer said <\s>
<s> we were four the french ambassador steyne and we two commoners <\s>
<s> why my uncle is in scot pen was going to break out but warrington pressed his foot under the table as a signal for him to be quiet <\s>
<s> it was about the same business that i have been to the palace to night archer went on simply and where i've been kept four hours in an anteroom with nothing but yesterday's times which i knew by heart as i wrote three of the leading articles myself and though the lord chamberlain came in four times and once holding the royal teacup and saucer in his hand he did not so much as say to me archer will you have a cup of tea indeed <\s>
<s> what is in the wind now <\s>
<s> asked warrington and turning to pen added you know i suppose that when there is anything wrong at court they always send for archer <\s>
<s> there is something wrong said mr <\s>
<s> archer and as the story will be all over the town in a day or two i don't mind telling it <\s>
<s> at the last chantilly races where i rode brian boru for my old friend the duke de saint cloud the old king said to me archer i'm uneasy about saint cloud <\s>
<s> i have arranged his marriage with the princess marie cunegonde the peace of europe depends upon it for russia will declare war if the marriage does not take place and the young fool is so mad about madame massena marshal massena's wife that he actually refuses to be a party to the marriage <\s>
<s> well sir i spoke to saint cloud and having got him into pretty good humour by winning the race and a good bit of money into the bargain he said to me archer tell the governor i'll think of it how do you say governor in french <\s>
<s> asked pen who piqued himself on knowing that language <\s>
<s> oh we speak in english i taught him when we were boys and i saved his life at twickenham when he fell out of a punt archer said <\s>
<s> i shall never forget the queen's looks as i brought him out of the water <\s>
<s> she gave me this diamond ring and always calls me charles to this day <\s>
<s> madame massena must be rather an old woman archer warrington said <\s>
<s> dev'lish old old enough to be his grandmother i told him so archer answered at once <\s>
<s> but those attachments for old women are the deuce and all <\s>
<s> that's what the king feels that's what shocks the poor queen so much <\s>
<s> they went away from paris last tuesday night and are living at this present moment at jaunay's hotel <\s>
<s> has there been a private marriage archer <\s>
<s> whether there has or not i don't know mr <\s>
<s> archer replied all i know is that i was kept waiting for four hours at the palace that i never saw a man in such a state of agitation as the king of belgium when he came out to speak to me and that i'm devilish hungry and here comes some supper <\s>
<s> he has been pretty well to night said warrington as the pair went home together but i have known him in much greater force and keeping a whole room in a state of wonder <\s>
<s> put aside his archery practice that man is both able and honest a good man of business an excellent friend admirable to his family as husband father and son <\s>
<s> what is it makes him pull the long bow in that wonderful manner <\s>
<s> an amiable insanity answered warrington <\s>
<s> he never did anybody harm by his talk or said evil of anybody <\s>
<s> he is a stout politician too and would never write a word or do an act against his party as many of us do <\s>
<s> of what profession is mr <\s>
<s> of the corporation of the goosequill of the press my boy said warrington of the fourth estate <\s>
<s> are you too of the craft then <\s>
<s> we will talk about that another time answered the other <\s>
<s> they were passing through the strand as they talked and by a newspaper office which was all lighted up and bright <\s>
<s> reporters were coming out of the place or rushing up to it in cabs there were lamps burning in the editors rooms and above where the compositors were at work the windows of the building were in a blaze of gas <\s>
<s> look at that pen warrington said <\s>
<s> there she is the great engine she never sleeps <\s>
<s> she has her ambassadors in every quarter of the world her couriers upon every road <\s>
<s> her officers march along with armies and her envoys walk into statesmen's cabinets <\s>
<s> yonder journal has an agent at this minute giving bribes at madrid and another inspecting the price of potatoes in covent garden <\s>
<s> here comes the foreign express galloping in <\s>
<s> they will be able to give news to downing street to morrow funds will rise or fall fortunes be made or lost lord b <\s>
<s> will get up and holding the paper in his hand and seeing the noble marquis in his place will make a great speech and and mr <\s>
<s> doolan will be called away from his supper at the back kitchen for he is foreign sub editor and sees the mail on the newspaper sheet before he goes to his own <\s>
<s> and so talking the friends turned into their chambers as the dawn was beginning to peep <\s>
<s> in which the printer's devil comes to the door pen in the midst of his revels and enjoyments humble as they were and moderate in cost if not in kind saw an awful sword hanging over him which must drop down before long and put an end to his frolics and feasting <\s>
<s> his money was very nearly spent <\s>
<s> his club subscription had carried away a third part of it <\s>
<s> he had paid for the chief articles of furniture with which he had supplied his little bedroom in fine he was come to the last five pound note in his pocket book and could think of no method of providing a successor for our friend had been bred up like a young prince as yet or as a child in arms whom his mother feeds when it cries out <\s>
<s> warrington did not know what his comrade's means were <\s>
<s> an only child with a mother at her country house and an old dandy of an uncle who dined with a great man every day pen might have a large bank at his command for anything that the other knew <\s>
<s> he had gold chains and a dressing case fit for a lord <\s>
<s> his habits were those of an aristocrat not that he was expensive upon any particular point for he dined and laughed over the pint of porter and the plate of beef from the cook's shop with perfect content and good appetite but he could not adopt the penny wise precautions of life <\s>
<s> he could not give twopence to a waiter he could not refrain from taking a cab if he had a mind to do so or if it rained and as surely as he took the cab he overpaid the driver <\s>
<s> he had a scorn for cleaned gloves and minor economies <\s>
<s> had he been bred to ten thousand a year he could scarcely have been more free handed and for a beggar with a sad story or a couple of pretty piteous faced children he never could resist putting his hand into his pocket <\s>
<s> it was a sumptuous nature perhaps that could not be brought to regard money a natural generosity and kindness and possibly a petty vanity that was pleased with praise even with the praise of waiters and cabmen <\s>
<s> i doubt whether the wisest of us know what our own motives are and whether some of the actions of which we are the very proudest will not surprise us when we trace them as we shall one day to their source <\s>
<s> warrington then did not know and pen had not thought proper to confide to his friend his pecuniary history <\s>
<s> that pen had been wild and wickedly extravagant at college the other was aware everybody at college was extravagant and wild but how great the son's expenses had been and how small the mother's means were points which had not been as yet submitted to mr <\s>
<s> at last the story came out while pen was grimly surveying the change for the last five pound note as it lay upon the tray from the public house by mr <\s>
<s> warrington's pot of ale <\s>
<s> it is the last rose of summer said pen its blooming companions have gone long ago and behold the last one of the garland has shed its leaves and he told warrington the whole story which we know of his mother's means of his own follies of laura's generosity during which time warrington smoked his pipe and listened intent <\s>
<s> impecuniosity will do you good pen's friend said knocking out the ashes at the end of the narration i don't know anything more wholesome for a man for an honest man mind you for another the medicine loses its effect than a state of tick <\s>
<s> it is an alterative and a tonic it keeps your moral man in a perpetual state of excitement as a man who is riding at a fence or has his opponent's single stick before him is forced to look his obstacle steadily in the face and braces himself to repulse or overcome it a little necessity brings out your pluck if you have any and nerves you to grapple with fortune <\s>
<s> you will discover what a number of things you can do without when you have no money to buy them <\s>
<s> you won't want new gloves and varnished boots eau de cologne and cabs to ride in <\s>
<s> you have been bred up as a molly coddle pen and spoilt by the women <\s>
<s> a single man who has health and brains and can't find a livelihood in the world doesn't deserve to stay there <\s>
<s> let him pay his last halfpenny and jump over waterloo bridge <\s>
<s> let him steal a leg of mutton and be transported and get out of the country he is not fit to live in it <\s>
<s> dixi i have spoken <\s>
<s> give us another pull at the pale ale <\s>
<s> you have certainly spoken but how is one to live <\s>
<s> there is beef and bread in plenty in england but you must pay for it with work or money <\s>
<s> and who will take my work <\s>
<s> and what work can i do <\s>
<s> warrington burst out laughing <\s>
<s> suppose we advertise in the times he said for an usher's place at a classical and commercial academy a gentleman b a <\s>
<s> boniface college and who was plucked for his degree confound you cried pen <\s>
<s> wishes to give lessons in classics and mathematics and the rudiments of the french language he can cut hair attend to the younger pupils and play a second on the piano with the daughters of the principal <\s>
<s> p lamb court temple <\s>
<s> go on said pen growling <\s>
<s> men take to all sorts of professions <\s>
<s> why there is your friend bloundell bloundell is a professional blackleg and travels the continent where he picks up young gentlemen of fashion and fleeces them <\s>
<s> there is bob o'toole with whom i was at school who drives the ballynafad mail now and carries honest jack finucane's own correspondence to that city <\s>
<s> i know a man sir a doctor's son like well don't be angry i meant nothing offensive a doctor's son i say who was walking the hospitals here and quarrelled with his governor on questions of finance and what did he do when he came to his last five pound note <\s>
<s> he let his mustachios grow went into a provincial town where he announced himself as professor spineto chiropodist to the emperor of all the russians and by a happy operation on the editor of the country newspaper established himself in practice and lived reputably for three years <\s>
<s> he has been reconciled to his family and has succeeded to his father's gallypots <\s>
<s> hang gallypots cried pen <\s>
<s> i can't drive a coach cut corns or cheat at cards <\s>
<s> there's nothing else you propose <\s>
<s> yes there's our own correspondent warrington said <\s>
<s> every man has his secrets look you <\s>
<s> before you told me the story of your money matters i had no idea but that you were a gentleman of fortune for with your confounded airs and appearance anybody would suppose you to be so <\s>
<s> from what you tell me about your mother's income it is clear that you must not lay any more hands on it <\s>
<s> you can't go on spunging upon the women <\s>
<s> you must pay off that trump of a girl <\s>
<s> laura is her name here is your health laura and carry a hod rather than ask for a shilling from home <\s>
<s> but how earn one <\s>
<s> how do i live think you <\s>
<s> on my younger brother's allowance pendennis <\s>
<s> i have secrets of my own my boy and here warrington's countenance fell <\s>
<s> i made away with that allowance five years ago if i had made away with myself a little time before it would have been better <\s>
<s> i have played off my own bat ever since <\s>
<s> i don't want much money <\s>
<s> when my purse is out i go to work and fill it and then lie idle like a serpent or an indian until i have digested the mass <\s>
<s> look i begin to feel empty warrington said and showed pen a long lean purse with but a few sovereigns at one end of it <\s>
<s> but how do you fill it <\s>
<s> i write said warrington <\s>
<s> i don't tell the world that i do so he added with a blush <\s>
<s> i do not choose that questions should be asked or perhaps i am an ass and don't wish it to be said that george warrington writes for bread <\s>
<s> but i write in the law reviews look here these articles are mine <\s>
<s> and he turned over some sheets <\s>
<s> i write in a newspaper now and then of which a friend of mine is editor <\s>
<s> and warrington going with pendennis to the club one day called for a file of the dawn and pointed with his finger silently to one or two articles which pen read with delight <\s>
<s> he had no difficulty in recognising the style afterwards the strong thoughts and curt periods the sense the satire and the scholarship <\s>
<s> i am not up to this said pen with a genuine admiration of his friend's powers <\s>
<s> i know very little about politics or history warrington and have but a smattering of letters <\s>
<s> i can't fly upon such a wing as yours <\s>
<s> but you can on your own my boy which is lighter and soars higher perhaps the other said good naturedly <\s>
<s> those little scraps and verses which i have seen of yours show me what is rare in these days a natural gift sir <\s>
<s> you needn't blush you conceited young jackanapes <\s>
<s> you have thought so yourself any time these ten years <\s>
<s> you have got the sacred flame a little of the real poetical fire sir i think and all our oil lamps are nothing compared to that though ever so well trimmed <\s>
<s> you are a poet pen my boy and so speaking warrington stretched out his broad hand and clapped pen on the shoulder <\s>
<s> arthur was so delighted that the tears came into his eyes <\s>
<s> how kind you are to me warrington <\s>
<s> i like you old boy said the other <\s>
<s> i was dev'lish lonely in chambers and wanted somebody and the sight of your honest face somehow pleased me <\s>
<s> i liked the way you laughed at lowton that poor good little snob <\s>
<s> and in fine the reason why i cannot tell but so it is young un <\s>
<s> i'm alone in the world sir and i wanted some one to keep me company and a glance of extreme kindness and melancholy passed out of warrington's dark eyes <\s>
<s> pen was too much pleased with his own thoughts to perceive the sadness of the friend who was complimenting him <\s>
<s> thank you warrington he said thank you for your friendship to me and and what you say about me <\s>
<s> i have often thought i was a poet <\s>
<s> i will be one i think i am one as you say so though the world mayn't <\s>
<s> is it is it the ariadne in naxos which you liked i was only eighteen when i wrote it or the prize poem <\s>
<s> warrington burst into a roar of laughter <\s>
<s> why young goose he yelled out of all the miserable weak rubbish i ever tried ariadne in naxos is the most mawkish and disgusting <\s>
<s> the prize poem is so pompous and feeble that i'm positively surprised sir it didn't get the medal <\s>
<s> you don't suppose that you are a serious poet do you and are going to cut out milton and aeschylus <\s>
<s> are you setting up to be a pindar you absurd little tom tit and fancy you have the strength and pinion which the theban eagle bear sailing with supreme dominion through the azure fields of air <\s>
<s> no my boy i think you can write a magazine article and turn a pretty copy of verses that's what i think of you <\s>
<s> said pen bouncing up and stamping his foot i'll show you that i am a better man than you think for <\s>
<s> warrington only laughed the more and blew twenty four puffs rapidly out of his pipe by way of reply to pen <\s>
<s> an opportunity for showing his skill presented itself before very long <\s>
<s> that eminent publisher mr <\s>
<s> bacon formerly bacon and bungay of paternoster row besides being the proprietor of the legal review in which mr <\s>
<s> warrington wrote and of other periodicals of note and gravity used to present to the world every year a beautiful gilt volume called the spring annual edited by the lady violet lebas and numbering amongst its contributors not only the most eminent but the most fashionable poets of our time <\s>
<s> young lord dodo's poems first appeared in this miscellany the honourable percy popjoy whose chivalrous ballads have obtained him such a reputation bedwin sands's eastern ghazuls and many more of the works of our young nobles were fast given to the world in the spring annual which has since shared the fate of other vernal blossoms and perished out of the world <\s>
<s> the book was daintily illustrated with pictures of reigning beauties or other prints of a tender and voluptuous character and as these plates were prepared long beforehand requiring much time in engraving it was the eminent poets who had to write to the plates and not the painters who illustrated the poems <\s>
<s> one day just when this volume was on the eve of publication it chanced that mr <\s>
<s> warrington called in paternoster row to talk with mr <\s>
<s> bacon's reader and general manager of publications for mr <\s>
<s> bacon not having the least taste in poetry or in literature of any kind wisely employed the services of a professional gentleman <\s>
<s> warrington then going into mr <\s>
<s> hack's room on business of his own found that gentleman with a bundle of proof plates and sheets of the spring annual before him and glanced at some of them <\s>
<s> percy popjoy had written some verses to illustrate one of the pictures which was called the church porch <\s>
<s> a spanish damsel was hastening to church with a large prayer book a youth in a cloak was hidden in a niche watching this young woman <\s>
<s> the picture was pretty but the great genius of percy popjoy had deserted him for he had made the most execrable verses which ever were perpetrated by a young nobleman <\s>
<s> warrington burst out laughing as he read the poem and mr <\s>
<s> hack laughed too but with rather a rueful face it won't do he said the public won't stand it <\s>
<s> bungay's people are going to bring out a very good book and have set up miss bunyan against lady violet <\s>
<s> we have most titles to be sure but the verses are too bad <\s>
<s> lady violet herself owns it she's busy with her own poem what's to be done <\s>
<s> we can't lose the plate <\s>
<s> the governor gave sixty pounds for it <\s>
<s> i know a fellow who would do some verses i think said warrington <\s>
<s> let me take the plate home in my pocket and send to my chambers in the morning for the verses <\s>
<s> you'll pay well of course <\s>
<s> of course said mr <\s>
<s> hack and warrington having despatched his own business went home to mr <\s>
<s> pen plate in hand <\s>
<s> now boy here's a chance for you <\s>
<s> turn me off a copy of verses to this <\s>
<s> a church porch a lady entering it and a youth out of a wine shop window ogling her what the deuce am i to do with it <\s>
<s> earn your livelihood for once you who long so to do it <\s>
<s> well i will try said pen <\s>
<s> and i'll go out to dinner said warrington and left mr <\s>
<s> pen in a brown study <\s>
<s> when warrington came home that night at a very late hour the verses were done <\s>
<s> there they are said pen <\s>
<s> i've screwed em out at last <\s>
<s> i think they'll do <\s>
<s> i think they will said warrington after reading them they ran as follows the church porch although i enter not yet round about the spot sometimes i hover and at the sacred gate with longing eyes i wait expectant of her <\s>
<s> the minster bell tolls out above the city's rout and noise and humming they've stopp'd the chiming bell i hear the organ's swell she's coming she's coming <\s>
<s> my lady comes at last timid and stepping fast and hastening hither with modest eyes downcast <\s>
<s> she comes she's here she's past <\s>
<s> may heaven go with her <\s>
<s> kneel undisturb'd fair saint pour out your praise or plaint meekly and duly <\s>
<s> i will not enter there to sully your pure prayer with thoughts unruly <\s>
<s> but suffer me to pace round the forbidden place lingering a minute like outcast spirits who wait and see through heaven's gate angels within it <\s>

<s> pen had never seen this scene of london life and walked with no small interest in at the grim gate of that dismal edifice <\s>

<s> the room though bare was not uncheerful <\s>
<s> the sun was shining in at the window near which sate a lady at work who had been gay and beautiful once but in whose faded face kindness and tenderness still beamed <\s>
<s> through all his errors and reckless mishaps and misfortunes this faithful creature adored her husband and thought him the best and cleverest as indeed he was one of the kindest of men <\s>
<s> nothing ever seemed to disturb the sweetness of his temper not debts not duns not misery not the bottle not his wife's unhappy position or his children's ruined chances <\s>
<s> he was perfectly fond of wife and children after his fashion he always had the kindest words and smiles for them and ruined them with the utmost sweetness of temper <\s>
<s> he never could refuse himself or any man any enjoyment which his money could purchase he would share his last guinea with jack and tom and we may be sure he had a score of such retainers <\s>
<s> he would sign his name at the back of any man's bill and never pay any debt of his own <\s>
<s> he would write on any side and attack himself or another man with equal indifference <\s>
<s> he was one of the wittiest the most amiable and the most incorrigible of irishmen <\s>
<s> nobody could help liking charley shandon who saw him once and those whom he ruined could scarcely be angry with him <\s>
<s> when pen and warrington arrived the captain he had been in an irish militia regiment once and the title remained with him was sitting on his bed in a torn dressing gown with a desk on his knees at which he was scribbling as fast as his rapid pen could write <\s>
<s> slip after slip of paper fell off the desk wet on to the ground <\s>
<s> a picture of his children was hung up over his bed and the youngest of them was pattering about the room <\s>
<s> opposite the captain sate mr <\s>

<s> oh very said mr <\s>
<s> and you're a very rich man mr <\s>
<s> bundy cried the child who could hardly speak plain <\s>

<s> oh never mind bungay roared out with a great laugh no harm in saying i'm rich he he i am pretty well off my little dear <\s>
<s> if you're rich why don't you take papa out of piz'n <\s>
<s> mamma at this began to wipe her eyes with the work on which she was employed <\s>
<s> the poor lady had hung curtains up in the room had brought the children's picture and placed it there and had made one or two attempts to ornament it mamma began to cry mr <\s>
<s> bungay turned red and looked fiercely out of his bloodshot little eyes shandon's pen went on and pen and warrington arrived with their knock <\s>
<s> captain shandon looked up from his work <\s>
<s> how do you do mr <\s>
<s> i'll speak to you in a minute <\s>
<s> please sit down gentlemen if you can find places and away went the pen again <\s>
<s> warrington pulled forward an old portmanteau the only available seat and sate down on it with a bow to mrs <\s>
<s> shandon and a nod to bungay the child came and looked at pen solemnly and in a couple of minutes the swift scribbling ceased and shandon turning the desk over on the bed stooped and picked up the papers <\s>
<s> i think this will do said he <\s>
<s> it's the prospectus for the pall mall gazette <\s>
<s> and here's the money for it mr <\s>
<s> bungay said laying down a five pound note <\s>
<s> i'm as good as my word i am <\s>
<s> when i say i'll pay i pay <\s>
<s> faith that's more than some of us can say said shandon and he eagerly clapped the note into his pocket <\s>
<s> which is passed in the neighbourhood of ludgate hill our imprisoned captain announced in smart and emphatic language in his prospectus that the time had come at last when it was necessary for the gentlemen of england to band together in defence of their common rights and their glorious order menaced on all sides by foreign revolutions by intestine radicalism by the artful calumnies of mill owners and cotton lords and the stupid hostility of the masses whom they gulled and led <\s>
<s> the ancient monarchy was insulted the captain said by a ferocious republican rabble <\s>
<s> the church was deserted by envious dissent and undermined by stealthy infidelity <\s>
<s> the good institutions which had made our country glorious and the name of english gentleman the proudest in the world were left without defence and exposed to assault and contumely from men to whom no sanctuary was sacred for they believed in nothing holy no history venerable for they were too ignorant to have heard of the past and no law was binding which they were strong enough to break when their leaders gave the signal for plunder <\s>
<s> it was because the kings of france mistrusted their gentlemen mr <\s>
<s> shandon remarked that the monarchy of saint louis went down it was because the people of england still believed in their gentlemen that this country encountered and overcame the greatest enemy a nation ever met it was because we were headed by gentlemen that the eagles retreated before us from the donro to the garonne it was a gentleman who broke the line at trafalgar and swept the plain of waterloo <\s>
<s> bungay nodded his head in a knowing manner and winked his eyes when the captain came to the waterloo passage and warrington burst out laughing <\s>
<s> you see how our venerable friend bungay is affected shandon said slily looking up from his papers that's your true sort of test <\s>
<s> i have used the duke of wellington and the battle of waterloo a hundred times and i never knew the duke to fail <\s>
<s> the captain then went on to confess with much candour that up to the present time the gentlemen of england confident of their right and careless of those who questioned it had left the political interest of their order as they did the management of their estates or the settlement of their legal affairs to persons affected to each peculiar service and had permitted their interests to be represented in the press by professional proctors and advocates <\s>
<s> that time shandon professed to consider was now gone by the gentlemen of england must be their own champions the declared enemies of their order were brave strong numerous and uncompromising <\s>
<s> they must meet their foes in the field they must not be belied and misrepresented by hireling advocates they must not have grub street publishing gazettes from whitehall that's a dig at bacon's people mr <\s>
<s> bungay said shandon turning round to the publisher <\s>
<s> bungay clapped his stick on the floor <\s>
<s> hang him pitch into him capting he said with exultation and turning to warrington wagged his dull head more vehemently than ever and said for a slashing article sir there's nobody like the capting no obody like him <\s>
<s> the prospectus writer went on to say that some gentlemen whose names were for obvious reasons not brought before the public at which mr <\s>
<s> warrington began to laugh again had determined to bring forward a journal of which the principles were so and so <\s>
<s> these men are proud of their order and anxious to uphold it cried out captain shandon flourishing his paper with a grin <\s>
<s> they are loyal to their sovereign by faithful conviction and ancestral allegiance they love their church where they would have their children worship and for which their forefathers bled they love their country and would keep it what the gentlemen of england yes the gentlemen of england we'll have that in large caps bungay my boy have made it the greatest and freest in the world and as the names of some of them are appended to the deed which secured our liberties at runnymede what's that <\s>
<s> an ancestor of mine sealed it with his sword hilt pen said with great gravity <\s>
<s> it's the habeas corpus mr <\s>
<s> bungay warrington said on which the publisher answered all right i dare say and yawned though he said go on capting <\s>
<s> at runnymede they are ready to defend that freedom to day with sword and pen and now as then to rally round the old laws and liberties of england <\s>
<s> the little child stood wondering the lady was working silently and looking with fond admiration <\s>
<s> come here little mary said warrington and patted the child's fair curls with his large hand <\s>
<s> but she shrank back from his rough caress and preferred to go and take refuge at pen's knee and play with his fine watch chain and pen was very much pleased that she came to him for he was very soft hearted and simple though he concealed his gentleness under a shy and pompous demeanour <\s>
<s> so she clambered up on his lap whilst her father continued to read his programme <\s>
<s> you were laughing the captain said to warrington about the obvious reasons which i mentioned <\s>
<s> now i'll show ye what they are ye unbelieving heathen <\s>
<s> we have said he went on that we cannot give the names of the parties engaged in this undertaking and that there were obvious reasons for that concealment <\s>
<s> we number influential friends in both houses of the senate and have secured allies in every diplomatic circle in europe <\s>
<s> our sources of intelligence are such as cannot by any possibility be made public and indeed such as no other london or european journal could by any chance acquire <\s>
<s> but this we are free to say that the very earliest information connected with the movement of english and continental politics will be found only in the columns of the pall mall gazette the statesman and the capitalist the country gentleman and the divine will be amongst our readers because our writers are amongst them <\s>
<s> we address ourselves to the higher circles of society we care not to disown it the pall mall gazette is written by gentlemen for gentlemen its conductors speak to the classes in which they live and were born <\s>
<s> the field preacher has his journal the radical free thinker has his journal why should the gentlemen of england be unrepresented in the press mr <\s>
<s> shandon then went on with much modesty to descant upon the literary and fashionable departments of the pall mall gazette which were to be conducted by gentlemen of acknowledged reputation men famous at the universities at which mr pendennis could scarcely help laughing and blushing known at the clubs and of the society which they described <\s>
<s> he pointed out delicately to advertisers that there would be no such medium as the pall mall gazette for giving publicity to their sales and he eloquently called upon the nobility of england the baronetage of england the revered clergy of england the bar of england the matrons the daughters the homes and hearths of england to rally round the good old cause and bungay at the conclusion of the reading woke up from a second snooze in which he had indulged himself and again said it was all right <\s>
<s> the reading of the prospectus concluded the gentlemen present entered into some details regarding the political and literary management of the paper and mr <\s>
<s> bungay sate by listening and nodding his head as if he understood what was the subject of their conversation and approved of their opinions <\s>
<s> bungay's opinions in truth were pretty simple <\s>
<s> he thought the captain could write the best smashing article in england <\s>
<s> he wanted the opposition house of bacon smashed and it was his opinion that the captain could do that business <\s>
<s> if the captain had written a letter of junius on a sheet of paper or copied a part of the church catechism mr <\s>
<s> bungay would have been perfectly contented and have considered that the article was a smashing article <\s>
<s> and he pocketed the papers with the greatest satisfaction and he not only paid for the ms as we have seen but he called little mary to him and gave her a penny as he went away <\s>
<s> the reading of the manuscript over the party engaged in general conversation shandon leading with a jaunty fashionable air in compliment to the two guests who sate with him and and who by their appearance and manner he presumed to be persons of the beau monde <\s>
<s> he knew very little indeed of the great world but he had seen it and made the most of what he had seen <\s>
<s> he spoke of the characters of the day and great personages of the fashion with easy familiarity and jocular allusions as if it had been his habit to live amongst them <\s>
<s> he told anecdotes of their private life and of conversations he had had and entertainments at which he had been present and at which such and such a thing occurred <\s>
<s> pen was amused to hear the shabby prisoner in a tattered dressing gown talking glibly about the great of the land <\s>
<s> shandon was always delighted when her husband told these tales and believed in them fondly every one <\s>
<s> she did not want to mingle in the fashionable world herself she was not clever enough but the great society was the very place for her charles he shone in it he was respected in it <\s>
<s> indeed shandon had once been asked to dinner by the earl of x his wife treasured the invitation card in her workbox at that very day <\s>
<s> bungay presently had enough of this talk and got up to take leave whereupon warrington and pen rose to depart with the publisher though the latter would have liked to stay to make a further acquaintance with this family who interested him and touched him <\s>
<s> he said something about hoping for permission to repeat his visit upon which shandon with a rueful grin said he was always to be found at home and should be delighted to see mr <\s>
<s> i'll see you to my park gate gentlemen said captain shandon seizing his hat in spite of a deprecatory look and a faint cry of charles from mrs <\s>
<s> and the captain in shabby slippers shuffled out before his guests leading the way through the dismal passages of the prison <\s>
<s> his hand was already fiddling with his waistcoat pocket where bungay's five pound note was as he took leave of the three gentlemen at the wicket one of them mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis being greatly relieved when he was out of the horrid place and again freely treading the flags of farringdon street <\s>
<s> shandon sadly went on with her work at the window looking into the court <\s>
<s> she saw shandon with a couple of men at his heels run rapidly in the direction of the prison tavern <\s>
<s> she had hoped to have had him to dinner herself that day there was a piece of meat and some salad in a basin on the ledge outside of the window of their room which she had expected that she and little mary were to share with the child's father <\s>
<s> but there was no chance of that now <\s>
<s> he would be in that tavern until the hours for closing it then he would go and play at cards or drink in some other man's room and come back silent with glazed eyes reeling a little on his walk that his wife might nurse him <\s>
<s> oh what varieties of pain do we not make our women suffer <\s>
<s> shandon went to the cupboard and in lieu of a dinner made herself some tea <\s>
<s> and in those varieties of pain of which we spoke anon what a part of confidante has that poor tea pot played ever since the kindly plant was introduced among us <\s>
<s> what myriads of women have cried over it to be sure <\s>
<s> what sick beds it has smoked by <\s>
<s> what fevered lips have received refreshment from out of it <\s>
<s> nature meant very gently by women when she made that tea plant and with a little thought what a series of pictures and groups the fancy may conjure up and assemble round the tea pot and cup <\s>
<s> melissa and sacharissa are talking love secrets over it <\s>
<s> poor polly has it and her lover's letters upon the table his letters who was her lover yesterday and when it was with pleasure not despair she wept over them <\s>
<s> mary tripping noiselessly comes into her mother's bedroom bearing a cup of the consoler to the widow who will take no other food ruth is busy concocting it for her husband who is coming home from the harvest field one could fill a page with hints for such pictures finally mrs <\s>
<s> shandon and little mary sit down and drink their tea together while the captain goes out and takes his pleasure <\s>
<s> she cares for nothing else but that when her husband is away <\s>
<s> a gentleman with whom we are already slightly acquainted mr <\s>
<s> jack finucane a townsman of captain shandon's found the captain's wife and little mary for whom jack always brought a sweetmeat in his pocket over this meal <\s>
<s> jack thought shandon the greatest of created geniuses had had one or two helps from the good natured prodigal who had always a kind word and sometimes a guinea for any friend in need and never missed a day in seeing his patron <\s>
<s> he was ready to run shandon's errands and transact his money business with publishers and newspaper editors duns creditors holders of shandon's acceptances gentlemen disposed to speculate in those securities and to transact the thousand little affairs of an embarrassed irish gentleman <\s>
<s> i never knew an embarrassed irish gentleman yet but he had an aide de camp of his own nation likewise in circumstances of pecuniary discomfort <\s>
<s> that aide de camp has subordinates of his own who again may have other insolvent dependents all through his life our captain marched at the head of a ragged staff who shared in the rough fortunes of their chieftain <\s>
<s> he won't have that five pound note very long i bet a guinea mr <\s>
<s> bungay said of the captain as he and his two companions walked away from the prison and the publisher judged rightly for when mrs <\s>
<s> shandon came to empty her husband's pockets she found but a couple of shillings and a few halfpence out of the morning's remittance <\s>
<s> shandon had given a pound to one follower had sent a leg of mutton and potatoes and beer to an acquaintance in the poor side of the prison had paid an outstanding bill at the tavern where he had changed his five pound note had had a dinner with two friends there to whom he lost sundry half crowns at cards afterwards so that the night left him as poor as the morning had found him <\s>
<s> the publisher and the two gentlemen had had some talk together after quitting shandon and warrington reiterated to bungay what he had said to his rival bacon viz that pen was a high fellow of great genius and what was more well with the great world and related to no end of the peerage <\s>
<s> bungay replied that he should be happy to have dealings with mr <\s>
<s> pendennis and hoped to have the pleasure of seeing both gents to cut mutton with him before long and so with mutual politeness and protestations they parted <\s>
<s> it is hard to see such a man as shandon pen said musing and talking that night over the sight which he had witnessed of accomplishments so multifarious and of such an undoubted talent and humour an inmate of a gaol for half his time and a bookseller's hanger on when out of prison <\s>
<s> i am a bookseller's hanger on you are going to try your paces as a hack warrington said with a laugh <\s>
<s> we are all hacks upon some road or other <\s>
<s> i would rather be myself than paley our neighbour in chambers who has as much enjoyment of his life as a mole <\s>
<s> a deuced deal of undeserved compassion has been thrown away upon what you call your bookseller's drudge <\s>
<s> much solitary pipes and ale make a cynic of you said pen you are a diogenes by a beer barrel warrington <\s>
<s> no man shall tell me that a man of genius as shandon is ought to be driven by such a vulgar slave driver as yonder mr <\s>
<s> bungay whom we have just left who fattens on the profits of the other's brains and enriches himself out of his journeyman's labour <\s>
<s> it makes me indignant to see a gentleman the serf of such a creature as that of a man who can't speak the language that he lives by who is not fit to black shandon's boots <\s>
<s> so you have begun already to gird at the publishers and to take your side amongst our order <\s>
<s> bravo pen my be boy <\s>
<s> warrington answered laughing still <\s>
<s> what have you got to say against bungay's relations with shandon <\s>
<s> was it the publisher think you who sent the author to prison <\s>
<s> is it bungay who is tippling away the five pound note which we saw just now or shandon <\s>
<s> misfortune drives a man into bad company pen said <\s>
<s> it is easy to cry fie <\s>
<s> against a poor fellow who has no society but such as he finds in a prison and no resource except forgetfulness and the bottle <\s>
<s> we must deal kindly with the eccentricities of genius and remember that the very ardour and enthusiasm of temperament which makes the author delightful often leads the man astray <\s>
<s> a fiddlestick about men of genius <\s>
<s> warrington cried out who was a very severe moralist upon some points though possibly a very had practitioner <\s>
<s> i deny that there are so many geniuses as people who whimper about the fate of men of letters assert there are <\s>
<s> there are thousands of clever fellows in the world who could if they would turn verses write articles read books and deliver a judgment upon them the talk of professional critics and writers is not a whit more brilliant or profound or amusing than that of any other society of educated people <\s>
<s> if a lawyer or a soldier or a parson outruns his income and does not pay his bills he must go to gaol and an author must go too <\s>
<s> if an author fuddles himself i don't know why he should be let off a headache the next morning if he orders a coat from the tailor's why he shouldn't pay for it <\s>
<s> i would give him more money to buy coats said pen smiling <\s>
<s> i suppose i should like to belong to a well dressed profession <\s>
<s> i protest against that wretch of a middle man whom i see between genius and his great landlord the public and who stops more than half of the labourer's earnings and fame <\s>
<s> i am a prose labourer warrington said you my boy are a poet in a small way and so i suppose consider you are authorised to be flighty <\s>
<s> what is it you want <\s>
<s> do you want a body of capitalists that shall be forced to purchase the works of all authors who may present themselves manuscript in hand <\s>
<s> everybody who writes his epic every driveller who can or can't spell and produces his novel or his tragedy are they all to come and find a bag of sovereigns in exchange for their worthless reams of paper <\s>
<s> who is to settle what is good or bad saleable or otherwise <\s>
<s> will you give the buyer leave in fine to purchase or not <\s>
<s> why sir when johnson sate behind the screen at saint john's gate and took his dinner apart because he was too shabby and poor to join the literary bigwigs who were regaling themselves round mr <\s>
<s> cave's best table cloth the tradesman was doing him no wrong <\s>
<s> you couldn't force the publisher to recognise the man of genius in the young man who presented himself before him ragged gaunt and hungry <\s>
<s> rags are not a proof of genius whereas capital is absolute as times go and is perforce the bargain master <\s>

<s> he was acquainted with gentlemen engaged in cultivating these various departments of knowledge and in communicating them afterwards to the public in fine jack finucane was as shandon had said of him and as he proudly owned himself to be one of the best sub editors of a paper in london <\s>
<s> he knew the weekly earnings of every man connected with the press and was up to a thousand dodges or ingenious economic contrivances by which money could be saved to spirited capitalists who were going to set up a paper <\s>

<s> bungay who was slow of comprehension by the rapidity of the calculations which he exhibited on paper as they sate in the box <\s>
<s> and bungay afterwards owned to his subordinate mr <\s>

<s> and now having succeeded in making this impression upon mr <\s>
<s> bungay the faithful fellow worked round to the point which he had very near at heart viz the liberation from prison of his admired friend and chief captain shandon <\s>
<s> he knew to a shilling the amount of the detainers which were against the captain at the porter's lodge of the fleet and indeed professed to know all his debts though this was impossible for no man in england certainly not the captain himself was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> he pointed out what shandon's engagements already were and how much better he would work if removed from confinement though this mr <\s>
<s> bungay denied for when the captain's locked up he said we are sure to find him at home whereas when he's free you can never catch hold of him ); finally he so worked on mr <\s>
<s> bungay's feelings by describing mrs <\s>
<s> shandon pining away in the prison and the child sickening there that the publisher was induced to promise that if mrs <\s>
<s> shandon would come to him in the morning he would see what could be done <\s>
<s> and the colloquy ending at this time with the second round of brandy and water although finucane who had four guineas in his pocket would have discharged the tavern reckoning with delight bungay said no sir this is my affair sir if you please <\s>
<s> james take the bill and eighteenpence for yourself and he handed over the necessary funds to the waiter <\s>
<s> thus it was that finucane who went to bed at the temple after the dinner at dick's found himself actually with his week's salary intact upon saturday morning <\s>
<s> shandon a wink so knowing and joyful that that kind creature knew some good news was in store for her and hastened to get her bonnet and shawl when fin asked if he might have the honour of taking her a walk and giving her a little fresh air <\s>
<s> and little mary jumped for joy at the idea of this holiday for finucane never neglected to give her a toy or to take her to a show and brought newspaper orders in his pocket for all sorts of london diversions to amuse the child <\s>
<s> indeed he loved them with all his heart and would cheerfully have dashed out his rambling brains to do them or his adored captain a service <\s>

<s> he was writing and not uncommonly took his greek and latin quotations of which he knew the use as a public writer from that wonderful repertory of learning <\s>

<s> shandon was in an old black watered silk her bonnet had never seen very brilliant days of prosperity any more than its owner but she could not help looking like a lady whatever her attire was <\s>

<s> i hope you're pretty well mum <\s>

<s> i want to stay with mamma cried little mary burying her face in her mother's dress <\s>
<s> go with this lady mary my dear said the mother <\s>
<s> i'll show you some pretty pictures said mrs <\s>
<s> bungay with the voice of an ogress and some nice things besides look here and opening her brown paper parcel mrs <\s>
<s> bungay displayed some choice sweet buscuits such as her bungay loved after his wine <\s>
<s> little mary followed after this attraction the whole party entering at the private entrance from which a side door led into mr <\s>
<s> here however as the child was about to part from her mother her courage again failed her and again she ran to the maternal petticoat upon which the kind and gentle mrs <\s>
<s> shandon seeing the look of disappointment in mrs <\s>
<s> bungay's face good naturedly said if you will let me i will come up too and sit for a few minutes and so the three females ascended the stairs together <\s>
<s> a second biscuit charmed little mary into perfect confidence and in a minute or two she prattled away without the least restraint <\s>
<s> faithful finucane meanwhile found mr <\s>
<s> bungay in a severer mood than he had been on the night previous when two thirds of a bottle of port and two large glasses of brandy and water had warmed his soul into enthusiasm and made him generous in his promises towards captain shandon <\s>
<s> his impetuous wife had rebuked him on his return home <\s>
<s> she had ordered that he should give no relief to the captain he was a good for nothing fellow whom no money would help she disapproved of the plan of the pall mall gazette and expected that bungay would only lose his money in it as they were losing over the way she always called her brother's establishment over the way by the whitehall journal <\s>
<s> let shandon stop in prison and do his work it was the best place for him <\s>
<s> in vain finucane pleaded and promised and implored for his friend bungay had had an hour's lecture in the morning and was inexorable <\s>
<s> but what honest jack failed to do below stairs in the counting house the pretty faces and manners of the mother and child were effecting in the drawing room where they were melting the fierce but really soft mrs <\s>
<s> there was an artless sweetness in mrs <\s>
<s> shandon's voice and a winning frankness of manner which made most people fond of her and pity her and taking courage by the rugged kindness with which her hostess received her the captain's lady told her story and described her husband's goodness and virtues and her child's failing health she was obliged to part with two of them she said and send them to school for she could not have them in that horrid place that mrs <\s>
<s> bungay though as grim as lady macbeth melted under the influence of the simple tale and said she would go down and speak to bungay <\s>

<s> bungay and with bungay to hear was to obey <\s>
<s> it was just when poor finucane was in despair about his negotiation that the majestic mrs <\s>
<s> bungay descended upon her spouse politely requested mr <\s>
<s> finucane to step up to his friends in her drawing room while she held a few minutes conversation with mr <\s>
<s> b and when the pair were alone the publisher's better half informed him of her intentions towards the captain's lady <\s>
<s> what's in the wind now my dear <\s>
<s> maecenas asked surprised at his wife's altered tone <\s>
<s> you wouldn't hear of my doing anything for the captain this morning i wonder what has been a changing of you <\s>
<s> the capting is an irishman mrs <\s>
<s> bungay replied and those irish i have always said i couldn't abide <\s>

<s> didn't you remark the little gurl <\s>
<s> b i saw the little girl <\s>
<s> and didn't you see how like she was to our angel bessy mr <\s>
<s> bungay's thoughts flew back to a period eighteen years back when bacon and bungay had just set up in business as small booksellers in a country town and when she had had a child named bessy something like the little mary who had moved her compassion <\s>
<s> well well my dear mr <\s>
<s> bungay said seeing the little eyes of his wife begin to twinkle and grow red the captain ain't in for much <\s>
<s> there's only a hundred and thirty pound against him <\s>
<s> half the money will take him out of the fleet finucane says and we'll pay him half salaries till he has made the account square <\s>
<s> when the little un said why don't you take par out of prizn <\s>
<s> i did feel it flora upon my honour i did now <\s>
<s> and the upshot of this conversation was that mr <\s>
<s> bungay both ascended to the drawing room and mr <\s>
<s> bungay made a heavy and clumsy speech in which he announced to mrs <\s>
<s> shandon that hearing sixty five pounds would set her husband free he was ready to advance that sum of money deducting it from the captain's salary and that he would give it to her on condition that she would personally settle with the creditors regarding her husband's liberation <\s>
<s> i think this was the happiest day that mrs <\s>
<s> finucane had had for a long time <\s>
<s> bedad bungay you're a trump <\s>
<s> roared out fin in an overpowering brogue and emotion <\s>
<s> give us your fist old boy and won't we send the pall mall gazette up to ten thousand a week that's all <\s>
<s> and he jumped about the room and tossed up little mary with a hundred frantic antics <\s>
<s> if i could drive you anywhere in my carriage mrs <\s>
<s> shandon i'm sure it's quite at your service mrs <\s>
<s> bungay said looking out at a one horsed vehicle which had just driven up and in which this lady took the air considerably and the two ladies with little mary between them whose tiny hand maecenas's wife kept fixed in her great grasp with the delighted mr <\s>
<s> finucane on the back seat drove away from paternoster row as the owner of the vehicle threw triumphant glances at the opposite windows at bacon's <\s>
<s> it won't do the captain any good thought bungay going back to his desk and accounts but mrs <\s>
<s> becomes reglar upset when she thinks about her misfortune <\s>
<s> the child would have been of age yesterday if she'd lived <\s>
<s> flora told me so and he wondered how women did remember things <\s>
<s> we are happy to say that mrs <\s>
<s> shandon sped with very good success upon her errand <\s>
<s> she who had had to mollify creditors when she had no money at all and only tears and entreaties wherewith to soothe them found no difficulty in making them relent by means of a bribe of ten shillings in the pound and the next sunday was the last for some time at least which the captain spent in prison <\s>
<s> dinner in the row upon the appointed day our two friends made their appearance at mr <\s>
<s> bungay's door in paternoster row not the public entrance through which booksellers boys issued with their sacks full of bungay's volumes and around which timid aspirants lingered with their virgin manuscripts ready for sale to sultan bungay but at the private door of the house whence the splendid mrs <\s>

<s> bacon's opposite windows at mrs <\s>
<s> bacon who was as yet a chaiseless woman <\s>
<s> on such occasions when very much wroth at her sister in law's splendour mrs <\s>
<s> bacon would fling up the sash of her drawing room window and look out with her four children at the chaise as much as to say look at these four darlings <\s>

<s> and it was with these arrows out of her quiver that emma bacon shot flora bungay as she sate in her chariot envious and childless <\s>
<s> as pen and warrington came to bungay's door a carriage and a cab drove up to bacon's <\s>

<s> wagg said she looked charming and pushed on straight at the young nobleman whom he called pop and to whom he instantly related a funny story seasoned with what the french call gros sel <\s>
<s> he was delighted to see pen too and shook hands with him and slapped him on the back cordially for he was full of spirits and good humour <\s>

<s> pen who had read and rather admired some of her works and expected to find in miss bunion a person somewhat resembling her own description of herself in the passion flower in which she stated that her youth resembled a violet shrinking meanly when blows the march wind keenly a timid fawn on wild wood lawn where oak boughs rustle greenly and that her maturer beauty was something very different certainly to the artless loveliness of her prime but still exceedingly captivating and striking beheld rather to his surprise and amusement a large and bony woman in a crumpled satin dress who came creaking into the room with a step as heavy as a grenadier's <\s>
<s> wagg instantly noted the straw which she brought in at the rumpled skirt of her dress and would have stooped to pick it up but miss bunion disarmed all criticism by observing this ornament herself and putting her own large foot upon it so as to separate it from her robe she stooped and picked up the straw saying to mrs <\s>
<s> bungay that she was very sorry to be a little late but that the omnibus was very slow and what a comfort it was to get a ride all the way from brompton for sixpence <\s>

<s> is that passion flowers pen said to wenham by whom he was standing <\s>
<s> why her picture in the volume represents her as a very well looking young woman <\s>
<s> you know passion flowers like all others will run to seed wenham said miss bunion's portrait was probably painted some years ago <\s>
<s> well i like her for not being ashamed of her poverty <\s>

<s> i said that i thought i should have the pleasure of meeting you to day and she begged me to thank you and say how greatly she was pleased <\s>
<s> this history told in a bland smiling manner of a duchess whom wenham had met that very morning too quite put poor wagg's dowager and baronet out of court and placed wenham beyond wagg as a man of fashion <\s>
<s> wenham kept this inestimable advantage and having the conversation to himself ran on with a number of anecdotes regarding the aristocracy <\s>
<s> he tried to bring mr <\s>
<s> popjoy into the conversation by making appeals to him and saying i was telling your father this morning or i think you were present at w <\s>
<s> house the other night when the duke said so and so but mr <\s>
<s> popjoy would not gratify him by joining in the talk preferring to fall back into the window recess with mrs <\s>
<s> bungay and watch the cabs that drove up to the opposite door <\s>
<s> at least if he would not talk the hostess hoped that those odious bacons would see how she had secured the noble percy popjoy for her party <\s>
<s> and now the bell of saint paul's tolled half an hour later than that for which mr <\s>
<s> bungay had invited his party and it was complete with the exception of two guests who at last made their appearance and in whom pen was pleased to recognise captain and mrs <\s>
<s> when these two had made their greetings to the master and mistress of the house and exchanged nods of more or less recognition with most of the people present pen and warrington went up and shook hands very warmly with mrs <\s>
<s> shandon who perhaps was affected to meet them and think where it was she had seen them but a few days before <\s>
<s> shandon was brushed up and looked pretty smart in a red velvet waistcoat and a frill into which his wife had stuck her best brooch <\s>
<s> in spite of mrs <\s>
<s> bungay's kindness perhaps in consequence of it mrs <\s>
<s> shandon felt great terror and timidity in approaching her indeed she was more awful than ever in her red satin and bird of paradise and it was not until she had asked in her great voice about the dear little gurl that the latter was somewhat encouraged and ventured to speak <\s>
<s> nice looking woman popjoy whispered to warrington <\s>
<s> do introduce me to captain shandon warrington <\s>
<s> i'm told he's a tremendous clever fellow and dammy i adore intellect by jove i do <\s>
<s> this was the truth heaven had not endowed young mr <\s>
<s> popjoy with much intellect of his own but had given him a generous faculty for admiring if not for appreciating the intellect of others <\s>
<s> and introduce me to miss bunion <\s>
<s> i'm told she's very clever too <\s>
<s> she's rum to look at certainly but that don't matter <\s>
<s> dammy i consider myself a literary man and i wish to know all the clever fellows <\s>
<s> shandon had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with one another and now the doors of the adjoining dining room being flung open the party entered and took their seats at table <\s>
<s> pen found himself next to bunion on one side and to mr <\s>
<s> wagg the truth is wagg fled alarmed from the vacant place by the poetess and pen was compelled to take it <\s>
<s> the gifted being did not talk much during dinner but pen remarked that she ate with a vast appetite and never refused any of the supplies of wine which were offered to her by the butler <\s>
<s> indeed miss bunion having considered mr <\s>
<s> pendennis for a minute who gave himself rather grand airs and who was attired in an extremely fashionable style with his very best chains shirt studs and cambric fronts he was set down and not without reason as a prig by the poetess who thought it was much better to attend to her dinner than to take any notice of him <\s>
<s> she told him as much in after days with her usual candour <\s>
<s> i took you for one of the little mayfair dandies she said to pen <\s>
<s> you looked as solemn as a little undertaker and as i disliked beyond measure the odious creature who was on the other side of me i thought it was best to eat my dinner and hold my tongue <\s>
<s> and you did both very well my dear miss bunion pen said with a laugh <\s>
<s> well so i do but i intend to talk to you the next time a great deal for you are neither so solemn nor so stupid nor so pert as you look <\s>
<s> ah miss bunion how i pine for that next time to come pen said with an air of comical gallantry but we must return to the day and the dinner at paternoster row <\s>
<s> the repast was of the richest description what i call of the florid gothic style wagg whispered to penn who sate beside the humourist in his side wing voice <\s>
<s> the men in creaking shoes and berlin gloves were numerous and solemn carrying on rapid conversations behind the guests as they moved to and fro with the dishes <\s>
<s> doolan called out waither to one of them and blushed when he thought of his blunder <\s>
<s> bungay's footboy was lost amidst those large and black coated attendants <\s>
<s> look at that very bow windowed man wagg said <\s>
<s> he's an undertaker in amen corner and attends funerals and dinners <\s>
<s> cold meat and hot don't you perceive <\s>
<s> he's the sham butler here and i observe my dear mr <\s>
<s> pendennis as you will through life that wherever there is a sham butler at a london dinner there is sham wine this sherry is filthy <\s>
<s> bungay my boy where did you get this delicious brown sherry <\s>
<s> i'm glad you like it mr <\s>
<s> wagg glass with you said the publisher <\s>
<s> it's some i got from alderman benning's store and gave a good figure for it i can tell you <\s>
<s> pendennis will you join us <\s>
<s> the old rogue where does he expect to go to <\s>
<s> it came from the public house wagg said <\s>
<s> it requires two men to carry off that sherry tis so uncommonly strong <\s>
<s> i wish i had a bottle of old steyne's wine here pendennis your uncle and i have had many a one <\s>
<s> he sends it about to people where he is in the habit of dining <\s>
<s> i remember at poor rawdon crawley's sir pitt crawley's brother he was governor of coventry island steyne's chef always came in the morning and the butler arrived wit the champagne from gaunt house in the ice pails ready <\s>
<s> how good this is <\s>
<s> you must have a cordon bleu in your kitchen <\s>
<s> bungay said thinking he spoke of a jack chain very likely <\s>
<s> i mean a french chef said the polite guest <\s>
<s> o yes your lordship again said the lady <\s>
<s> does your artist say he's a frenchman mrs <\s>
<s> well i'm sure i don't know answered the publisher's lady <\s>
<s> because if he does he's a quizzin yer cried mr <\s>
<s> wagg but nobody saw the pun which disconcerted somewhat the bashful punster <\s>
<s> the dinner is from griggs in st <\s>
<s> paul's churchyard so is bacon's he whispered pen <\s>
<s> bungay writes to give half a crown a head more than bacon so does bacon <\s>
<s> they would poison each other's ices if they could get near them and as for the made dishes they are poison <\s>
<s> this hum ha this brimborion a la sevigne is delicious mrs <\s>
<s> b he said helping himself to a dish which the undertaker handed to him <\s>
<s> well i'm glad you like it mrs <\s>
<s> bungay answered blushing and not knowing whether the name of the dish was actually that which wagg gave to it but dimly conscious that that individual was quizzing her <\s>
<s> accordingly she hated mr <\s>
<s> wagg with female ardour and would have deposed him from his command over mr <\s>
<s> bungay's periodical but that his name was great in the trade and his reputation in the land considerable <\s>
<s> by the displacement of persons warrington had found himself on the right hand of mrs <\s>
<s> shandon who sate in plain black silk and faded ornaments by the side of the florid publisher <\s>
<s> the sad smile of the lady moved his rough heart to pity <\s>
<s> nobody seemed to interest himself about her she sate looking at her husband who himself seemed rather abashed in the presence of some of the company <\s>
<s> wenham and wagg both knew him and his circumstances <\s>
<s> he had worked with the latter and was immeasurably his superior in wit genius and acquirement but wagg's star was brilliant in the world and poor shandon was unknown there <\s>
<s> he could not speak before the noisy talk of the coarser and more successful man but drank his wine in silence and as much of it as the people would give him <\s>
<s> he was under surveillance <\s>
<s> bungay had warned the undertaker not to fill the captain's glass too often or too full <\s>
<s> it was a melancholy precaution that and the more melancholy that it was necessary <\s>
<s> shandon too cast alarmed glances across the table to see that her husband did not exceed <\s>
<s> abashed by the failure of his first pun for he was impudent and easily disconcerted wagg kept his conversation pretty much to pen during the rest of dinner and of course chiefly spoke about their neighbours <\s>
<s> this is one of bungay's grand field days he said <\s>
<s> we are all bungavians here did you read popjoy's novel <\s>
<s> it was an old magazine story written by poor buzzard years ago and forgotten here until mr <\s>
<s> trotter that is trotter with the large shirt collar fished it out and bethought him that it was applicable to the late elopement so bob wrote a few chapters a propos popjoy permitted the use of his name and i dare say supplied a page here and there and desperation or the fugitive duchess made its appearance <\s>
<s> the great fun is to examine popjoy about his own work of which he doesn't know a word i say popjoy what a capital passage that is in volume three where the cardinal in disguise after being converted by the bishop of london proposes marriage to the duchess's daughter <\s>
<s> glad you like it popjoy answered it's a favourite bit of my own <\s>
<s> there's no such thing in the whole book whispered wagg to pen <\s>
<s> it wouldn't be a bad plot for a high church novel <\s>
<s> i remember poor byron hobhouse trelawney and myself dining with cardinal mezzocaldo at rome captain sumph began and we had some orvieto wine for dinner which byron liked very much <\s>
<s> and i remember how the cardinal regretted that he was a single man <\s>
<s> we went to civita vecchia two days afterwards where byron's yacht was and by jove the cardinal died within three weeks and byron was very sorry for he rather liked him <\s>
<s> a devilish interesting story sumph indeed wagg said <\s>
<s> you should publish some of those stories captain sumph you really should <\s>
<s> such a volume would make our friend bungay's fortune shandon said <\s>
<s> why don't you ask sumph to publish em in your new paper the what d'ye call 'em hay shandon <\s>
<s> why don't you ask him to publish em in your old magazine the thingumbob <\s>
<s> is there going to be a new paper <\s>
<s> asked wenham who knew perfectly well but was ashamed of his connection with the press <\s>
<s> bungay going to bring out a paper <\s>
<s> cried popjoy who on the contrary was proud of his literary reputation and acquaintances <\s>
<s> you must employ me <\s>
<s> bungay use your influence with him and make him employ me <\s>
<s> prose or verse what shall it be <\s>
<s> novels poems travels or leading articles begad <\s>
<s> anything or everything only let bungay pay me and i'm ready i am now my dear mrs <\s>
<s> it's to be called the small beer chronicle growled wagg and little popjoy is to be engaged for the infantine department <\s>
<s> it is to be called the pall mall gazette sir and we shall be very happy to have you with us shandon said <\s>
<s> pall mall gazette why pall mall gazette <\s>
<s> because the editor was born at dublin the sub editor at cork because the proprietor lives in paternoster row and the paper is published in catherine street strand <\s>
<s> won't that reason suffice you wagg <\s>
<s> shandon said he was getting rather angry <\s>
<s> everything must have a name <\s>
<s> my dog ponto has got a namee <\s>
<s> you've got a name and a name which you deserve more or less indeed <\s>
<s> why d'ye grudge the name to our paper <\s>
<s> by any other name it would smell as sweet said wagg <\s>
<s> i'll have ye remember its name's not what d'ye call 'em mr <\s>
<s> you know its name well enough and and you know mine <\s>
<s> and i know your address too said wagg but this was spoken in an undertone and the good natured irishman was appeased almost in an instant after his ebullition of spleen and asked wagg to drink wine with him in a friendly voice <\s>
<s> when the ladies retired from the table the talk grew louder still and presently wenham in a courtly speech proposed that everybody should drink to the health of the new journal eulogising highly the talents wit and learning of its editor captain shandon <\s>
<s> it was his maxim never to lose the support of a newspaper man and in the course of that evening he went round and saluted every literary gentleman present with a privy compliment specially addressed to him informing this one how great an impression had been made in downing street by his last article and telling that one how profoundly his good friend the duke of so and so had been struck by the ability of the late numbers <\s>
<s> the evening came to a close and in spite of all the precautions to the contrary poor shandon reeled in his walk and went home to his new lodgings with his faithful wife by his side and the cabman on his box jeering at him <\s>
<s> wenham had a chariot of his own which he put at popjoy's seat and the timid miss bunion seeing mr <\s>
<s> wagg who was her neighbour about to depart insisted upon a seat in his carriage much to that gentleman's discomfiture <\s>
<s> pen and warrington walked home together in the moonlight <\s>
<s> and now warrington said that you have seen the men of letters tell me was i far wrong in saying that there are thousands of people in this town who don't write books who are to the full as clever and intellectual as people who do <\s>
<s> pen was forced to confess that the literary personages with whom he had become acquainted had not said much in the course of the night's conversation that was worthy to be remembered or quoted <\s>
<s> in fact not one word about literature had been said during the whole course of the night and it may be whispered to those uninitiated people who are anxious to know the habits and make the acquaintance of men of letters that there are no race of people who talk about books or perhaps who read books so little as literary men <\s>
<s> the pall mall gazette considerable success at first attended the new journal <\s>
<s> it was generally stated that an influential political party supported the paper and great names were cited amongst the contributors to its columns <\s>
<s> was there any foundation for these rumours <\s>
<s> we are not at liberty to say whether they were ill founded but this much we may divulge that an article upon foreign policy which was generally attributed to a noble lord whose connexion with the foreign office is very well known was in reality composed by captain shandon in the parlour of the bear and staff public house near whitehall stairs whither the printer's boy had tracked him and where a literary ally of his mr <\s>
<s> bludyer had a temporary residence and that a series of papers on finance questions which were universally supposed to be written by a great statesman of the house of commons were in reality composed by mr <\s>
<s> george warrington of the upper temple <\s>
<s> that there may have been some dealings between the pall mall gazette and this influential party is very possible percy popjoy whose father lord falconet was a member of the party might be seen not unfrequently ascending the stairs to warrington's chambers and some information appeared in the paper which it gave a character and could only be got from very peculiar sources <\s>
<s> several poems feeble in thought but loud and vigorous in expression appeared in the pall mall gazette with the signature of p <\s>
<s> p and it must be owned that his novel was praised in the new journal in a very outrageous manner <\s>
<s> in the political department of the paper mr <\s>
<s> pen did not take any share but he was a most active literary contributor <\s>
<s> the pall mall gazette had its offices as we have heard in catherine street in the strand and hither pen often came with his manuscripts in his pocket and with a great deal of bustle and pleasure such as a man feels at the outset of his literary career when to see himself in print is still a novel sensation and he yet pleases himself to think that his writings are creating some noise in the world <\s>
<s> here it was that mr <\s>
<s> jack finucane the sub editor compiled with paste and scissors the journal of which he was supervisor <\s>
<s> with an eagle eye he scanned all the paragraphs of all the newspapers which had anything to do with the world of fashion over which he presided <\s>
<s> he didn't let a death or a dinner party of the aristocracy pass without having the event recorded in the columns of his journal and from the most recondite provincial prints and distant scotch and irish newspapers he fished out astonishing paragraphs and intelligence regarding the upper classes of society <\s>
<s> it was a grand nay a touching sight for a philosopher to see jack finucane esquire with a plate of meat from the cookshop and glass of porter from the public house for his meal recounting the feasts of the great as if h had been present at them and in tattered trousers and dingy shirt sleeves cheerfully describing and arranging the most brilliant fetes of the world of fashion <\s>
<s> the incongruity of finucane's avocation and his manners and appearance amused his new friend pen <\s>
<s> since he left his own native village where his rank probably was not very lofty jack had seldom seen any society but such as used the parlour of the taverns which he frequented whereas from his writing you would have supposed that he dined with ambassadors and that his common lounge was the bow window of white's <\s>
<s> errors of description it is true occasionally slipped from his pen but the ballinafad sentinel of which he was own correspondent suffered by these not the pall mall gazette in which jack was not permitted to write much his london chiefs thinking that the scissors and the paste were better wielded by him than the pen <\s>
<s> pen took a great deal of pains with the writing of his reviews and having a pretty fair share of desultory reading acquired in the early years of his life an eager fancy and a keen sense of fun his articles pleased his chief and the public and he was proud to think that he deserved the money which he earned <\s>
<s> we may be sure that the pall mall gazette was taken in regularly at fairoaks and read with delight by the two ladies there <\s>
<s> it was received at clavering park too where we know there was a young lady of great literary tastes and old doctor portman himself to whom the widow sent her paper after she had got her son's articles by heart signified his approval of pen's productions saying that the lad had spirit taste and fancy and wrote if not like a scholar at any rate like a gentleman <\s>
<s> and what was the astonishment and delight of our friend major pendennis on walking into one of his clubs the regent where wenham lord falconet and some other gentlemen of good reputation and fashion were assembled to hear them one day talking over a number of the pall mall gazette and of an article which appeared in its columns making some bitter fun of the book recently published by the wife of a celebrated member of the opposition party <\s>
<s> the book in question was a book of travels in spain and italy by the countess of muffborough in which it was difficult to say which was the most wonderful the french or the english in which languages her ladyship wrote indifferently and upon the blunders of which the critic pounced with delightful mischief <\s>
<s> the critic was no other than pen he jumped and danced round about his subject with the greatest jocularity and high spirits he showed up the noble lady's faults with admirable mock gravity and decorum <\s>
<s> there was not a word in the article which was not polite and gentlemanlike and the unfortunate subject of the criticism was scarified and laughed at during the operation <\s>
<s> wenham's bilious countenance was puckered up with malign pleasure as he read the critique <\s>
<s> lady muffborough had not asked him to her parties during the last year <\s>
<s> lord falconet giggled and laughed with all his heart lord muffborough and he had been rivals ever since they began life and these complimented major pendennis who until now had scarcely paid any attention to some hints which his fairoaks correspondence threw out of dear arthur's constant and severe literary occupations which i fear may undermine the poor boy's health and had thought any notice of mr <\s>
<s> pen and his newspaper connexions quite below his dignity as a major and a gentleman <\s>
<s> but when the oracular wenham praised the boy's production when lord falconet who had had the news from percy popjoy approved of the genius of young pen when the great lord steyne himself to whom the major referred the article laughed and sniggered over it swore it was capital and that the muffborough would writhe under it like a whale under a harpoon the major as in duty bound began to admire his nephew very much said by gad the young rascal had some stuff in him and would do something he had always said he would do something and with a hand quite tremulous with pleasure the old gentleman sate down to write to the widow at fairoaks all that the great folks had said in praise of pen and he wrote to the young rascal too asking when he would come and eat a chop with his old uncle and saying that he was commissioned to take him to dinner at gaunt house for lord steyne liked anybody who could entertain him whether by his folly wit or by his dulness by his oddity affectation good spirits or any other quality <\s>
<s> pen flung his letter across the table to warrington perhaps he was disappointed that the other did not seem to be much affected by it <\s>
<s> the courage of young critics is prodigious they clamber up to the judgment seat and with scarce a hesitation give their opinion upon works the most intricate or profound <\s>
<s> had macaulay's history or herschel's astronomy been put before pen at this period he would have looked through the volumes meditated his opinion over a cigar and signified his august approval of either author as if the critic had been their born superior and indulgent master and patron <\s>
<s> by the help of the biographie universelle or the british museum he would be able to take a rapid resume of a historical period and allude to names dates and facts in such a masterly easy way as to astonish his mamma at home who wondered where her boy could have acquired such a prodigious store of reading and himself too when he came to read over his articles two or three months after they had been composed and when he had forgotten the subject and the books which he had consulted <\s>
<s> at that period of his life mr <\s>
<s> pen owns that he would not have hesitated at twenty four hours notice to pass his opinion upon the greatest scholars or to give a judgment upon the encyclopaedia <\s>
<s> luckily he had warrington to laugh at him and to keep down his impertinence by a constant and wholesome ridicule or he might have become conceited beyond all sufferance for shandon liked the dash and flippancy of his young aide de camp and was indeed better pleased with pen's light and brilliant flashes than with the heavier metal which his elder coadjutor brought to bear <\s>
<s> but though he might justly be blamed on the score of impertinence and a certain prematurity of judgment mr <\s>
<s> pen was a perfectly honest critic a great deal too candid for mr <\s>
<s> bungay's purposes indeed who grumbled sadly at his impartiality <\s>
<s> pen and his chief the captain had a dispute upon this subject one day <\s>
<s> in the name of common sense mr <\s>
<s> pendennis shandon asked what have you been doing praising one of mr <\s>
<s> bungay has been with me in a fury this morning at seeing a laudatory article upon one of the works of the odious firm over the way <\s>
<s> pen's eyes opened with wide astonishment <\s>
<s> do you mean to say he asked that we are to praise no books that bacon publishes or that if the books are good we are to say they are bad <\s>
<s> my good young friend for what do you suppose a benevolent publisher undertakes a critical journal to benefit his rival <\s>
<s> to benefit himself certainly but to tell the truth too pen said ruat coelum to tell the truth <\s>
<s> and my prospectus said shandon with a laugh and a sner do you consider that was a work of mathematical accuracy of statement <\s>
<s> pardon me that is not the question pen said and i don't think you very much care to argue it <\s>
<s> i had some qualms of conscience about that same prospectus and debated the matter with my friend warrington <\s>
<s> we agreed however pen said laughing that because the prospectus was rather declamatory and poetical and the giant was painted upon the show board rather larger than the original who was inside the caravan we need not be too scrupulous about this trifling inaccuracy but might do our part of the show without loss of character or remorse of conscience <\s>
<s> we are the fiddlers and play our tunes only you are the showman <\s>
<s> and leader of the van said shandon <\s>
<s> well i am glad that your conscience gave you leave to play for us <\s>
<s> yes but said pen with a fine sense of the dignity of his position we are all party men in england and i will stick to my party like a briton <\s>
<s> i will be as good natured as you like to our own side he is a fool who quarrels with his own nest and i will hit the enemy as hard as you like but with fair play captain if you please <\s>
<s> one can't tell all the truth i suppose but one can tell nothing but the truth and i would rather starve by jove and never earn another penny by my pen this redoubted instrument had now been in use for some six weeks and pen spoke of it with vast enthusiasm and respect than strike an opponent an unfair blow or if called upon to place him rank him below his honest desert <\s>
<s> pendennis when we want bacon smashed we must get some other hammer to do it shandon said with fatal good nature and very likely thought within himself a few years hence perhaps the young gentleman won't be so squeamish <\s>
<s> the veteran condottiere himself was no longer so scrupulous <\s>
<s> he had fought and killed on so many a side for many a year past that remorse had long left him <\s>
<s> gad said he you've a tender conscience mr <\s>
<s> it's the luxury of all novices and i may have had one once myself but that sort of bloom wears off with the rubbing of the world and i'm not going to the trouble myself of putting on an artificial complexion like our pious friend wenham or our model of virtue wagg <\s>
<s> i don't know whether some people's hypocrisy is not better captain than other's cynicism <\s>
<s> it's more profitable at any rate said the captain biting his nails <\s>
<s> that wenham is as dull a quack as ever quacked and you see the carriage in which he drove to dinner <\s>
<s> faith it'll be a long time before mrs <\s>
<s> shandon will take a drive in her own chariot <\s>
<s> god help her poor thing <\s>
<s> and pen went away from his chief after their little dispute and colloquy pointing his own moral to the captain's tale and thinking to himself behold this man stored with genius wit learning and a hundred good natural gifts see how he has wrecked them by paltering with his honesty and forgetting to respect himself <\s>
<s> wilt thou remember thyself o pen <\s>
<s> thou art conceited enough <\s>
<s> wilt thou sell thy honour for a bottle <\s>
<s> no by heaven's grace we will be honest whatever befalls and our mouths shall only speak the truth when they open <\s>
<s> a punishment or at least a trial was in store for mr <\s>
<s> in the very next number of the pall mall gazette warrington read out with roars of laughter an article which by no means amused arthur pendennis who was himself at work with a criticism for the next week's number of the same journal and in which the spring annual was ferociously maltreated by some unknown writer <\s>
<s> the person of all most cruelly mauled was pen himself <\s>
<s> his verses had not appeared with his own name in the spring annual but under an assumed signature <\s>
<s> as he had refused to review the book shandon had handed it over to mr <\s>
<s> bludyer with directions to that author to dispose of it <\s>
<s> and he had done so effectually <\s>
<s> bludyer who was a man of very considerable talent and of a race which i believe is quite extinct in the press of our time had a certain notoriety in his profession and reputation for savage humour <\s>
<s> he smashed and trampled down the poor spring flowers with no more mercy than a bull would have on a parterre and having cut up the volume to his heart's content went and sold it at a bookstall and purchased a pint of brandy with the proceeds of the volume <\s>
<s> where pen appears in town and country let us be allowed to pass over a few months of the history of mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis's lifetime during the which many events may have occurred which were more interesting and exciting to himself than they would be likely to prove to the reader of his present memoirs <\s>
<s> we left him in his last chapter regularly entered upon his business as a professional writer or literary hack as mr <\s>
<s> warrington chooses to style himself and his friend and we know how the life of any hack legal or literary in a curacy or in a marching regiment or at a merchant's desk is dull of routine and tedious of description <\s>
<s> one day's labour resembles another much too closely <\s>
<s> a literary man has often to work for his bread against time or against his will or in spite of his health or of his indolence or of his repugnance to the subject on which he is called to exert himself just like any other daily toiler <\s>
<s> when you want to make money by pegasus as he must perhaps who has no other saleable property farewell poetry and aerial flights pegasus only rises now like mr <\s>
<s> green's balloon at periods advertised beforehand and when the spectator's money has been paid <\s>
<s> pegasus trots in harness over the stony pavement and pulls a cart or a cab behind him <\s>
<s> often pegasus does his work with panting sides and trembling knees and not seldom gets a cut of the whip from his driver <\s>
<s> do not let us however be too prodigal of our pity upon pegasus <\s>
<s> there is no reason why this animal should be exempt from labour or illness or decay any more than any of the other creatures of god's world <\s>
<s> if he gets the whip pegasus often deserves it and i for one am quite ready to protest my friend george warrington against the doctrine which poetical sympathisers are inclined to put forward viz that of letters and what is called genius are to be exempt from prose duties of this daily bread wanting tax paying life and not to be made to work and pay like their neighbours <\s>
<s> well then the pall mall gazette being duly established and arthur pendennis's merits recognised as a flippant witty and amusing critic he worked away hard every week preparing reviews of such works as came into his department and writing his reviews with flippancy certainly but with honesty and to the best of his power <\s>
<s> it might be that a historian of threescore who had spent a quarter of a century in composing a work of which our young gentleman disposed in the course of a couple of days reading at the british museum was not altogether fairly treated by such a facile critic or that a poet who had been elaborating sublime sonnets and odes until he thought them fit for the public and for fame was annoyed by two or three dozen pert lines in mr <\s>
<s> pen's review in which the poet's claims were settled by the critic as if the latter were my lord on the bench and the author a miserable little suitor trembling before him <\s>
<s> the actors at the theatres complained of him wofully too and very likely he was too hard upon them <\s>
<s> but there was not much harm done after all <\s>
<s> it is different now as we know but there were so few great historians or great poets or great actors in pen's time that scarce any at all came up for judgment his critical desk <\s>
<s> those who got a little whipping got what in the main was good for them not that the judge was any better or wiser than the persons whom he sentenced or indeed ever fancied himself so <\s>
<s> pen had a strong sense of humour and justice and had not therefore an overweening respect for his own works besides he had his friend warrington at his elbow a terrible critic if the young man was disposed to be conceited and more savage over pen than ever he was to those whom he tried at his literary assize <\s>
<s> by these critical labours and by occasional contributions to leading articles of the journal when without wounding his paper this eminent publicist could conscientiously speak his mind mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis gained the sum of four pounds four shillings weekly and with no small pains and labour <\s>

<s> under the title of the begum lady clavering's fame began to spread in london before she herself descended upon the capital and as it has been the boast of delolme and blackstone and all panegyrists of the british constitution that we admit into our aristocracy merit of every kind and that the lowliest born man if he but deserve it may wear the robes of a peer and sit alongside of a cavendish or a stanley so it ought to be the boast of our good society that haughty though it be naturally jealous of its privileges and careful who shall be admitted into its circle yet if an individual be but rich enough all barriers are instantly removed and he or she is welcomed as from his wealth he merits to be <\s>
<s> this fact shows our british independence and honest feeling our higher orders are not such mere haughty aristocrats as the ignorant represent them on the contrary if a man have money they will hold out their hands to him eat his dinners dance at his balls marry his daughters or give their own lovely girls to his sons as affably as your commonest roturier would do <\s>
<s> as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family <\s>
<s> in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strong's soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor <\s>
<s> he hung and re hung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronet's factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strong's cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal <\s>
<s> the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> he was waited on by a former spanish legionary and comrade of his whom he had left at a breach of a spanish fort and found at a crossing in tottenham court road and whom he had elevated to the rank of body servant to himself and to the chum who at present shared his lodgings <\s>
<s> this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont <\s>
<s> no man was less curious or at any rate more discreet than ned strong and he did not care to inquire into the mysterious connexion which very soon after their first meeting at baymouth was established between sir francis clavering and the envoy of the nawaub <\s>
<s> the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patron's early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield <\s>
<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>
<s> on one of these occasions the nawaub's envoy must have been in an exceeding ill humour for he crushed clavering's letter in his hand and said with his own particular manner and emphasis a hundred be hanged <\s>
<s> i'll have no more letters nor no more shilly shally <\s>
<s> tell clavering i'll have a thousand or by jove i'll split and burst him all to atoms <\s>
<s> let him give me a thousand and i'll go abroad and i give you my honour as a gentleman i'll not ask him for no more for a year <\s>
<s> give him that message from me strong my boy and tell him if the money ain't here next friday at twelve o'clock as sure as my name's what it is i'll have a paragraph in the newspaper on saturday and next week i'll blow up the whole concern <\s>
<s> strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamont's hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required <\s>
<s> altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour <\s>
<s> strong saw him embark at dover <\s>
<s> it must be forgery at the very least he thought that has put clavering into this fellow's power and the colonel has got the bill <\s>
<s> before the year was out however this happy country saw the colonel once more upon its shores <\s>
<s> a confounded run on the red had finished him he said at baden baden no gentleman could stand against a colour coming up fourteen times <\s>
<s> he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamont's bill though evidently very much against his will for in strong's hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtor's goal in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again <\s>
<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>
<s> now and again she would give him a present or pay an outstanding gambling debt but she always exacted a pretty accurate account of the moneys so required and respecting the subsidies to the colonel clavering fairly told strong that he couldn't speak to his wife <\s>
<s> strong's business in life was to procure this money and other sums for his patron <\s>
<s> and in the chevalier's apartments in shepherd's inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable bank notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them <\s>
<s> when a man has been in the habit of getting in debt from his early youth and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him a little while after the advent of prosperity the money lender is pretty certain to be in the house again and the bills with the old signature in the market <\s>
<s> clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strong's lodgings than at his own and such was the chevalier's friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted <\s>
<s> having drawn clavering's bills he got them discounted in the city <\s>
<s> when they became due he parleyed with the bill holders and gave them instalments of their debt or got time in exchange for fresh acceptances <\s>
<s> regularly or irregularly gentlemen must live somehow and as we read how the other day at comorn the troops forming that garrison were gay and lively acted plays danced at balls and consumed their rations though menaced with an assault from the enemy without the walls and with a gallows if the austrians were successful so there are hundreds of gallant spirits in this town walking about in good spirits dining every day in tolerable gaiety and plenty and going to sleep comfortably with a bailiff always more or less near and a rope of debt round their necks the which trifling inconveniences ned strong the old soldier bore very easily <\s>
<s> but we shall have another opportunity of making acquaintance with these and some other interesting inhabitants of shepherd's inn and in the meanwhile are keeping lady clavering and her friends too long waiting on the door steps of grosvenor place <\s>
<s> first they went into the gorgeous dining room fitted up lady clavering couldn't for goodness gracious tell why in the middle aged style unless said her good natured ladyship laughing because me and clavering are middle aged people and here they were offered the copious remains of the luncheon of which lady clavering and blanche had just partaken <\s>
<s> when nobody was near our little sylphide who scarcely ate at dinner more than the six grains of rice of amina the friend of the ghouls in the arabian nights was most active with her knife and fork and consumed a very substantial portion of mutton cutlets in which piece of hypocrisy it is believed she resembled other young ladies of fashion <\s>
<s> pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the dining room with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase <\s>
<s> there were indeed high backed dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardour street and tapestry from france bits of armour double handed swords and battle axes made of carton pierre looking glasses statuettes of saints and dresden china nothing in a word could be chaster <\s>
<s> behind the dining room was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style <\s>
<s> here it was that guarded by double doors sir francis smoked cigars and read bell's life in london and went to sleep after dinner when he was not smoking over the billiard table at his clubs or punting at the gambling houses in saint james's <\s>
<s> but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawing rooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warming pans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandy legged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterie tables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons <\s>
<s> wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each out squealing and out chattering the other a clock singing tunes on a console table and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiece there was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise <\s>
<s> a london drawing room fitted up without regard to expense is surely one of the noblest and most curious sights of the present day <\s>
<s> the romans of the lower empire the dear marchionesses and countesses of louis xv could scarcely have had a finer taste than our modern folks exhibit and everybody who saw lady clavering's reception rooms was forced to confess that they were most elegant and that the prettiest rooms in london lady harley quin's lady hanway wardour's or mrs <\s>
<s> hodge podgson's own the great railroad croesus wife were not fitted up with a more consummate chastity <\s>
<s> poor lady clavering meanwhile knew little regarding these things and had a sad want of respect for the splendours around her <\s>
<s> i only know they cost a precious deal of money major she said to her guest and that i don't advise you to try one of them gossamer gilt chairs i came down on one the night we gave our second dinner party <\s>
<s> why didn't you come and see us before <\s>
<s> we'd have asked you to it <\s>
<s> you would have liked to see mamma break a chair wouldn't you mr <\s>

<s> cried the sylphide tossing up her little head <\s>
<s> i have a fellow feeling with those who fall remember pen said <\s>
<s> i suffered myself very much from doing so once <\s>
<s> and you went home to laura to console you said miss amory <\s>
<s> he did not like the remembrance of the consolation which laura had given to him nor was he very well pleased to find that his rebuff in that quarter was known to the world so as he had nothing to say in reply he began to be immensely interested in the furniture round about him and to praise lady clavering's taste with all his might <\s>
<s> no don't praise me said honest lady clavering it's all the upholsterer's doings and captain strong's they did it all while we was at the park and and lady rockminster has been here and says the salongs are very well said lady clavering with an air and tone of great deference <\s>
<s> my cousin laura has been staying with her pen said <\s>

<s> no no you cannot be far wrong <\s>
<s> lady rockminster i should say arthur is the very centre of the circle of fashion and taste <\s>

<s> and the major's voice hushed as he spoke of this great lady and he looked round and surveyed the apartments awfully and respectfully as if he had been at church <\s>
<s> yes lady rockminster has took us up said lady clavering <\s>
<s> taken us up mamma cried blanche in a shrill voice <\s>
<s> well taken us up then said my lady it's very kind of her and i dare say we shall like it when we git used to it only at first one don't fancy being took well taken up at all <\s>
<s> she is going to give our balls for us and wants to invite all our dinners <\s>

<s> you must come to me arthur and major come let me see on the 14th it ain't one of our grand dinners blanche she said looking round at her daughter who bit her lips and frowned very savagely for a sylphide <\s>
<s> the major with a smile and a bow said he would much rather come to a quiet meeting than to a grand dinner <\s>
<s> he had had enough of those large entertainments and preferred the simplicity of the home circle <\s>
<s> i always think a dinner's the best the second day said lady clavering thinking to mend her first speech <\s>
<s> on the 14th we'll be quite a snug little party at which second blunder miss blanche clasped her hands in despair and said o mamma vous etes incorrigible <\s>
<s> major pendennis vowed that he liked snug dinners of all things in the world and confounded her ladyship's impudence for daring to ask such a man as him to a second day's dinner <\s>
<s> but he was a man of an economical turn of mind and bethinking himself that he could throw over these people if anything better should offer he accepted with the blandest air <\s>
<s> as for pen he was not a diner out of thirty years standing as yet and the idea of a fine feast in a fine house was still perfectly welcome to him <\s>
<s> what was that pretty little quarrel which engaged itself between your worship and miss amory <\s>
<s> the major asked of pen as they walked away together <\s>
<s> i thought you used to au mieux in that quarter <\s>
<s> used to be answered pen with a dandified air is a vague phrase regarding a woman <\s>
<s> was and is are two very different terms sir as regards women's hearts especially <\s>
<s> egad they change as we do cried the elder <\s>
<s> when we took the cape of good hope i recollect there was a lady who talked poisoning herself for your humble servant and begad in three months she ran away from her husband with somebody else <\s>

<s> no arthur my dear fellow with your person and expectations you ought to make a good coup in marriage some day or other and though i wouldn't have this repeated at fairoaks you rogue ha <\s>
<s> a reputation for a little wickedness and for being an homme dangereux don't hurt a young fellow with the women <\s>
<s> they like it sir they hate a milksop young men must be young men you know <\s>
<s> but for marriage continued the veteran moralist that is a very different matter <\s>
<s> marry a woman with money <\s>
<s> i've told you before it is as easy to get a rich wife as a poor one and a doosed deal more comfortable to sit down to a well cooked dinner with your little entrees nicely served than to have nothing but a damned cold leg of mutton between you and your wife <\s>
<s> we shall have a good dinner on the 14th when we dine with sir francis clavering stick to that my boy in your relations with the family <\s>
<s> cultivate em but keep em for dining <\s>
<s> no more of your youthful follies and nonsense about love in a cottage <\s>
<s> it must be a cottage with a double coach house a cottage of gentility sir said pen quoting the hackneyed ballad of the devil's walk but his uncle did not know that poem though perhaps he might be leading pen upon the very promenade in question and went on with his philosophical remarks very much pleased with the aptness of the pupil to whom he addressed them <\s>
<s> indeed arthur pendennis was a clever fellow who took his colour very readily from his neighbour and found the adaptation only too easy <\s>
<s> warrington the grumbler growled out that pen was becoming such a puppy that soon there would be no bearing him <\s>
<s> but the truth is the young man's success and dashing manners pleased his elder companion <\s>
<s> he liked to see pen gay and spirited and brimful of health and life and hope as a man who has long since left off being amused with clown and harlequin still gets a pleasure in watching a child at a pantomime <\s>
<s> pen's former sulkiness disappeared with his better fortune and he bloomed as the sun began to shine upon him <\s>
<s> colonel altamont appears and disappears on the day appointed major pendennis who had formed no better engagement and arthur who desired none arrived together to dine with sir francis clavering <\s>
<s> the only tenants of the drawing room when pen and his uncle reached it were sir francis and his wife and our friend captain strong whom arthur was very glad to see though the major looked very sulkily at strong being by no means well pleased to sit down to dinner with clavering's d house steward as he irreverently called strong <\s>
<s> welbore welbore clavering's country neighbour and brother member of parliament speedily arriving pendennis the elder was somewhat appeased for welbore though perfectly dull and taking no more part in the conversation at dinner than the footman behind his chair was a respectable country gentleman of ancient family and seven thousand a year and the major felt always at ease in such society <\s>
<s> to these were added other persons of note the dowager lady rockminster who had her reasons for being well with the clavering family and the lady agnes foker with her son mr <\s>
<s> harry our old acquaintance <\s>
<s> pynsent could not come his parliamentary duties keeping him at the house duties which sate upon the two other senators very lightly <\s>
<s> miss blanche amory was the last of the company who made her appearance <\s>
<s> she was dressed in a killing white silk dress which displayed her pearly shoulders to the utmost advantage <\s>
<s> foker whisped to pen who regarded her with eyes of evident admiration that he considered her a stunner <\s>
<s> she chose to be very gracious to arthur upon this day and held out her hand most cordially and talked about dear fairoaks and asked for dear laura and his mother and said she was longing to go back to the country and in fact was entirely simple affectionate and artless <\s>
<s> harry foker thought he had never seen anybody so amiable and delightful not accustomed much to the society of ladies and ordinarily being dumb to their presence he found that he could speak before miss amory and became uncommonly lively and talkative even before the dinner was announced and the party descended to the lower rooms <\s>
<s> he would have longed to give his arm to the fair blanche and conduct her down the broad carpeted stair but she fell to the lot of pen upon this occasion mr <\s>

<s> but though he was separated from the object of his desire during the passage downstairs the delighted foker found himself by miss amory's side at the dinner table and flattered himself that he had manoeuvred very well in securing that happy place <\s>
<s> it may be that the move was not his but that it was made by another person <\s>
<s> blanche had thus the two young men one on each side of her and each tried to render himself gallant and agreeable <\s>
<s> foker's mamma from her place surveying her darling boy was surprised at his vivacity <\s>

<s> miss amory is a sylph herself said mr <\s>
<s> what a delightful tenor voice you have mr <\s>
<s> foker said the young lady <\s>
<s> i am sure you have been well taught <\s>
<s> i sing a little myself <\s>
<s> i should like to sing with you <\s>
<s> pen remembered that words very similar had been addressed to himself by the young lady and that she had liked to sing with him in former days <\s>
<s> and sneering within himself he wondered with how many other gentlemen she had sung duets since his time <\s>
<s> but he did not think fit to put this awkward question aloud and only said with the very tenderest air which he could assume i should like to hear you sing again miss blanche <\s>
<s> i never heard a voice i liked so well as yours i think <\s>
<s> i thought you liked laura's said miss blanche <\s>
<s> laura's is a contralto and that voice is very often out you know pen said bitterly <\s>
<s> i have heard a great deal of music in london he continued <\s>
<s> i'm tired of those professional people they sing too loud or i have grown too old or too blase <\s>
<s> one grows old very soon in london miss amory <\s>

<s> said pen with an imploring voice <\s>
<s> shall i sing you an english song after dinner <\s>
<s> asked the sylphide turning to mr <\s>
<s> i will if you will promise to come up soon and she gave him a perfect broadside of her eyes <\s>
<s> i'll come up after dinner fast enough he said simply <\s>
<s> i don't care about much wine afterwards i take my whack at dinner i mean my share you know and when i have had as much as i want i toddle up to tea <\s>

<s> how the doose do they get those cherries inside the jellies <\s>
<s> in this way the artless youth prattled on and miss amory listened to him with inexhaustible good humour <\s>
<s> when the ladies took their departure for the upper regions blanche made the two young men promise faithfully to quit the table soon and departed with kind glances to each <\s>

<s> as the dinner at which pen and his uncle took their places was not one of our grand parties it had been served at a considerably earlier hour than those ceremonial banquets of the london season which custom has ordained shall scarcely take place before nine o'clock and the company being small and miss blanche anxious to betake herself to her piano in the drawing room giving constant hints to her mother to retreat lady clavering made that signal very speedily so that it was quite daylight yet when the ladies reached the upper apartments from the flower embroidered balconies of which they could command a view of the two parks of the poor couples and children still sauntering in the one and of the equipages of ladies and the horses of dandies passing through the arch of the other <\s>
<s> the sun in a word had not set behind the elms of kensington gardens and was still gilding the statue erected by the ladies of england in honour of his grace the duke of wellington when lady clavering and her female friends left the gentlemen drinking wine <\s>
<s> the windows of the dining room were opened to let in the fresh air and afforded to the passers by in the street a pleasant or perhaps tantalising view of six gentlemen in white waistcoats with a quantity of decanters and a variety of fruits before them little boys as they passed and jumped up at the area railings and took a peep said to one another hi hi jim shouldn't you like to be there and have a cut of that there pineapple the horses and carriages of the nobility and gentry passed by conveying them to belgravian toilets the policeman with clamping feet patrolled up and down before the mansion the shades of evening began to fall the gasman came and lighted the lamps before sir francis's door the butler entered the dining room and illuminated the antique gothic chandelier over the antique carved oak dining table so that from outside the house you looked inwards upon a night scene of feasting and wax candles and from within you beheld a vision of a calm summer evening and the wall of saint james's park and the sky above in which a star or two was just beginning to twinkle <\s>
<s> jeames with folded legs leaning against the door pillar of his master's abode looked forth musingly upon the latter tranquil sight whilst a spectator clinging to the railings examined the former scene <\s>
<s> policeman x passing gave his attention to neither but fixed it upon the individual holding by the railings and gazing into sir francis clavering's dining room where strong was laughing and talking away making the conversation for the party <\s>
<s> the man at the railing was very gorgeously attired with chains jewellery and waistcoats which the illumination from the house lighted up to great advantage his boots were shiny he had brass buttons to his coat and large white wristbands over his knuckles and indeed looked so grand that x imagined he beheld a member of parliament or a person of consideration before him <\s>
<s> whatever his rank however the m p or person of consideration was considerably excited by wine for he lurched and reeled somewhat in his gait and his hat was cocked over his wild and bloodshot eyes in a manner which no sober hat ever could assume <\s>
<s> his copious black hair was evidently surreptitious and his whiskers of the tyrian purple <\s>
<s> as strong's laughter following after one of his own gros mots came ringing out of window this gentleman without laughed and sniggered in the queerest way likewise and he slapped his thigh and winked at jeames pensive in the portico as much as to say plush my boy isn't that a good story <\s>
<s> jeames's attention had been gradually drawn from the moon in the heavens to this sublunary scene and he was puzzled and alarmed by the appearance of the man in shiny boots <\s>
<s> a holtercation he remarked afterwards in the servants' hall a holtercation with a feller in the streets is never no good and indeed he was not hired for any such purpose <\s>
<s> so having surveyed the man for some time who went on laughing reeling nodding his head with tipsy knowingness jeames looked out of the portico and softly called pleaceman and beckoned to that officer <\s>
<s> x marched up resolute with one berlin glove stuck in his belt side and jeames simply pointed with his index finger to the individual who was laughing against the railings <\s>
<s> not one single word more than pleaceman did he say but stood there in the calm summer evening pointing calmly a grand sight <\s>
<s> x advanced to the individual and said now sir will you have the kindness to move hon <\s>
<s> the individual who was in perfect good humour did not appear to bear one word which policeman x uttered but nodded and waggled his grinning head at strong until his hat almost fell from his head over the area railings <\s>
<s> now sir move on do you hear <\s>
<s> cries x in a much more peremptory tone and he touched the stranger gently with one of the fingers enclosed in the gauntlets of the berlin woof <\s>

<s> move on out of this said x and don't be a blocking up the pavement staring into gentlemen's dining rooms <\s>
<s> not stare ho ho not stare that is a good one replied the other with a satiric laugh and sneer who's to prevent me from staring looking at my friends if i like <\s>

<s> a gentleman in a white waistcoat running out from a dining room bareheaded a policeman and an individual decently attired engaged in almost fisticuffs on the pavement were enough to make a crowd even in that quiet neighbourhood at half past eight o'clock in the evening and a small mob began to assemble before sir francis clavering's door <\s>
<s> for god's sake come in strong said seizing his acquaintance's arm <\s>

<s> strong had intended to convey the stranger into sir francis's private sitting room where the hats of the male guests were awaiting them and having there soothed his friend by bland conversation to have carried him off as soon as the cab arrived but the new comer was in a great state of wrath at the indignity which had been put upon him and when strong would have led him into the second door said in a tipsy voice that ain't the door that's the dining room door where the drink's going on and i'll go and have some by jove i'll go and have some <\s>
<s> at this audacity the butler stood aghast in the hall and placed himself before the door but it opened behind him and the master of the house made his appearance with anxious looks <\s>

<s> pines i've seen em feed pigs on pines said the colonel <\s>
<s> all the nawaub of lucknow's pigs are fed on pines strong whispered to major pendennis <\s>
<s> oh of course the major answered <\s>
<s> sir francis clavering was in the meanwhile endeavouring to make an excuse to his brother guest for the new comer's condition and muttered something regarding altamont that he was an extraordinary character very eccentric very had indian habits didn't understand the rules of english society to which old welbore a shrewd old gentleman who drank his wine with great regularity said that seemed pretty clear <\s>
<s> then the colonel seeing pen's honest face regarded it for a while with as much steadiness as became his condition and said i know you too young fellow <\s>
<s> baymouth ball by jingo <\s>
<s> wanted to fight the frenchman <\s>
<s> i remember you and he laughed and he squared with his fists and seemed hugely amused in the drunken depths of his mind as these recollections passed or rather reeled across it <\s>
<s> pendennis you remember colonel altamont at baymouth <\s>
<s> strong said upon which pen bowing rather stiffly said he had the pleasure of remembering that circumstance perfectly <\s>
<s> pendennis pendennis be hanged <\s>
<s> altamont roared out to the surprise of every one and thumping with his fist on the table <\s>
<s> my name is also pendennis sir said the major whose dignity was exceedingly mortified by the evening's events that he major pendennis should have been asked to such a party and that a drunken man should have been introduced to it <\s>
<s> my name is pendennis and i will be obliged to you not to curse it too loudly <\s>
<s> the tipsy man turned round to look at him and as he looked it appeared as if colonel altamont suddenly grew sober <\s>
<s> he put his hand across his forehead and in doing so displaced somewhat the black wig which he wore and his eyes stared fiercely at the major who in his turn like a resolute old warrior as he was looked at his opponent very keenly and steadily <\s>
<s> at the end of the mutual inspection altamont began to button up his brass buttoned coat and rising up from his chair suddenly and to the company's astonishment reeled towards the door and issued from it followed by strong all that the latter heard him utter was captain beak <\s>
<s> captain beak by jingo <\s>
<s> there had not passed above a quarter of an hour from his strange appearance to his equally sudden departure <\s>
<s> the two young men and the baronet's other guest wondered at the scene and could find no explanation for it <\s>
<s> clavering seemed exceedingly pale and agitated and turned with looks of almost terror towards major pendennis <\s>
<s> the latter had been eyeing his host keenly for a moment or two <\s>
<s> do you know him <\s>
<s> asked sir francis of the major <\s>
<s> i am sure i have seen the fellow the major replied looking as if he too was puzzled <\s>
<s> yes i have it <\s>
<s> he was a deserter from the horse artillery who got into the nawaub's service <\s>
<s> i remember his face quite well <\s>
<s> said clavering with a sigh which indicated immense relief of mind and the major looked at him with a twinkle of his sharp old eyes <\s>
<s> the cab which strong had desired to be called drove away with the chevalier and colonel altamont coffee was brought to the remaining gentlemen and they went upstairs to the ladies in the drawing room foker declaring confidentially to pen that this was the rummest go he ever saw which decision pen said laughing showed great discrimination on mr <\s>
<s> then according to her promise miss amory made music for the young men <\s>
<s> foker was enraptured with her performance and kindly joined in the airs which she sang when he happened to be acquainted with them <\s>
<s> pen affected to talk aside with others of the party but blanche brought him quickly to the piano by singing some of his own words those which we have given in a previous number indeed and which the sylphide had herself she said set to music <\s>
<s> i don't know whether the air was hers or how much of it was arranged for her by signor twankidillo from whom she took lessons but good or bad original or otherwise it delighted mr <\s>
<s> pen who remained by her side and turned the leaves now for her most assiduously gad <\s>
<s> how i wish i could write verses like you pen foker sighed afterwards to his companion <\s>
<s> if i could do em wouldn't i that's all <\s>
<s> but i never was a dab at writing you see and i'm sorry i was so idle when i was at school <\s>
<s> no mention was made before the ladies of the curious little scene which had been transacted below stairs although pen was just on the point of describing it to miss amory when that young lady inquired for captain strong who she wished should join her in a duet <\s>
<s> but chancing to look up towards sir francis clavering arthur saw a peculiar expression of alarm in the baronet's ordinarily vacuous face and discreetly held his tongue <\s>
<s> it was rather a dull evening <\s>
<s> welbore went to sleep as he always did at music and after dinner nor did major pendennis entertain the ladies with copious anecdotes and endless little scandalous stories as his wont was but sate silent for the most part and appeared to be listening to the music and watching the fair young performer <\s>
<s> the hour of departure having arrived the major rose regretting that so delightful an evening should have passed away so quickly and addressed a particularly fine compliment to miss amory upon her splendid talents as a singer <\s>
<s> your daughter lady clavering he said to that lady is a perfect nightingale a perfect nightingale begad <\s>
<s> i have scarcely ever heard anything equal to her and her pronunciation of every language begad of every language seems to me to be perfect and the best houses in london must open before a young lady who has such talents and allow an old fellow to say miss amory such a face <\s>
<s> blanche was as much astonished by these compliments as pen was to whom his uncle a little time since had been speaking in very disparaging terms of the sylph <\s>
<s> the major and the two young men walked home together after mr <\s>
<s> foker had placed his mother in her carriage and procured a light for an enormous cigar <\s>
<s> the young gentleman's company or his tobacco did not appear to be agreeable to major pendennis who eyed him askance several times and with a look which plainly indicated that he wished mr <\s>
<s> foker would take his leave but foker hung on resolutely to the uncle and nephew even until they came to the former's door in bury street where the major wished the lads good night <\s>
<s> and i say pen he said in a confidential whisper calling his nephew back mind you make a point of calling in grosvenor place to morrow <\s>
<s> they've been uncommonly civil mons'ously civil and kind <\s>
<s> pen promised and wondered and the major's door having been closed upon him by morgan foker took pen's arm and walked with him for some time silently puffing his cigar <\s>
<s> at last when they had reached charing cross on arthur's way home to the temple harry foker relieved himself and broke out with that eulogium upon poetry and those regrets regarding a misspent youth which have just been mentioned <\s>
<s> and all the way along the strand and up to the door of pen's very staircase in lamb court temple young harry foker did not cease to speak about singing and blanche amory <\s>
<s> harry foker's affairs since that fatal but delightful night in grosvenor place mr <\s>
<s> harry foker's heart had been in such a state of agitation as you would hardly have thought so great a philosopher could endure <\s>
<s> when we remember what good advice he had given to pen in former days how an early wisdom and knowledge of the world had manifested itself in this gifted youth how a constant course of self indulgence such as becomes a gentleman of his means and expectations ought by right to have increased his cynicism and made him with every succeeding day of his life care less and less for every individual in the world with the single exception of mr <\s>
<s> harry foker one may wonder that he should fall into the mishap to which most of us are subject once or twice in our lives and disquiet his great mind about a woman <\s>
<s> but foker though early wise was still a man <\s>
<s> he could no more escape the common lot than achilles or ajax or lord nelson or adam our first father and now his time being come young harry became a victim to love the all conqueror <\s>
<s> when he went to the back kitchen that night after quitting arthur pendennis at his staircase door in lamb court the gin twist and devilled turkey had no charms for him the jokes of his companions fell flatly on his ear and when mr <\s>
<s> hodgen the singer of the body snatcher had a new chant even more dreadful and humorous than that famous composition foker although he appeared his friend and said bravo hodgen as common politeness and his position as one of the chiefs of the back kitchen bound him to do yet never distinctly heard one word of the song which under its title of the cat in the cupboard hodgen has since rendered so famous <\s>
<s> late and very tired he slipped into his private apartments at home and sought the downy pillow but his slumbers were disturbed by the fever of his soul and the very instant that he woke from his agitated sleep the image of miss amory presented itself to him and said here i am i am your princess and beauty you have discovered me and shall care for nothing else hereafter <\s>
<s> heavens how stale and distasteful his former pursuits and friendships appeared to him <\s>
<s> he had not been up to the present time much accustomed to the society of females of his own rank in life <\s>
<s> when he spoke of such he called them modest women <\s>
<s> that virtue which let us hope they possessed had not hitherto compensated to mr <\s>
<s> foker for the absence of more lively qualities which most of his own relatives did not enjoy and which he found in mesdemoiselles the ladies of the theatre <\s>
<s> his mother though good and tender did not amuse her boy his cousins the daughters of his maternal uncle the respectable earl of rosherville wearied him beyond measure <\s>
<s> one was blue and a geologist one was a horsewoman and smoked cigars one was exceedingly low church and had the most heterodox views on religious matters at least so the other said who was herself of the very highest church faction and made the cupboard in her room into an oratory and fasted on every friday in the year <\s>
<s> their paternal house of drummington foker could very seldom be got to visit <\s>
<s> he swore he had rather go on the treadmill than stay there <\s>
<s> he was not much beloved by the inhabitants <\s>
<s> lord erith lord rosherville's heir considered his cousin a low person of deplorably vulgar habits and manners while foker and with equal reason voted erith a prig and a dullard the nightcap of the house of commons the speaker's opprobrium the dreariest of philanthropic spouters <\s>
<s> nor could george robert earl of gravesend and rosherville ever forget that on one evening when he condescended to play at billiards with his nephew that young gentleman poked his lordship in the side with his cue and said well old cock i've seen many a bad stroke in my life but i never saw such a bad one as that there <\s>
<s> he played the game out with angelic sweetness of temper for harry was his guest as well as his nephew but he was nearly having a fit in the night and he kept to his own rooms until young harry quitted drummington on his return to oxbridge where the interesting youth was finishing his education at the time when the occurrence took place <\s>
<s> it was an awful blow to the venerable earl the circumstance was never alluded to in the family he shunned foker whenever he came to see them in london or in the country and could hardly be brought to gasp out a how d'ye do <\s>
<s> to the young blasphemer <\s>
<s> but he would not break his sister agnes's heart by banishing harry from the family altogether nor indeed could he afford to break with mr <\s>
<s> foker senior between whom and his lordship there had been many private transactions producing an exchange of bank cheques from mr <\s>
<s> foker and autographs from the earl himself with the letters i o u written over his illustrious signature <\s>
<s> besides the four daughters of lord gravesend whose various qualities have been enumerated in the former paragraph his lordship was blessed with a fifth girl the lady ana milton who from her earliest years and nursery had been destined to a peculiar position in life <\s>
<s> it was ordained between her parents and her aunt that when mr harry foker attained a proper age lady ann should become his wife <\s>
<s> the idea had been familiar to her mind when she yet wore pinafores and when harry the dirtiest of little boys used to come back with black eyes from school to drummington or to his father's house of logwood where lady ann lived much with her aunt <\s>
<s> both of the young people coincided with the arrangement proposed by the elders without any protests or difficulty <\s>
<s> it no more entered lady ann's mind to question the order of her father than it would have entered esther's to dispute the commands of ahasuerus <\s>
<s> the heir apparent of the house of foker was also obedient for when the old gentleman said harry your uncle and i have agreed that when you're of a proper age you'll marry lady ann <\s>
<s> she won't have any money but she's good blood and a good one to look at and i shall make you comfortable <\s>
<s> if you refuse you'll have your mother's jointure and two hundred a year during my life harry who knew that his sire though a man of few words was yet implicitly to be trusted acquiesced at once in the parental decree and said well sir if ann's agreeable i say ditto <\s>
<s> she's not a bad looking girl <\s>
<s> and she has the best blood in england sir <\s>
<s> your mother's blood your own blood sir said the brewer <\s>
<s> there's nothing like it sir <\s>
<s> well sir as you like it harry replied <\s>
<s> when you want me please ring the bell <\s>
<s> only there's no hurry and i hope you'll give us a long day <\s>
<s> i should like to have my fling out before i marry <\s>
<s> fling away harry answered the benevolent father <\s>
<s> nobody prevents you do they <\s>
<s> and so very little more was said upon this subject and mr <\s>
<s> harry pursued those amusements in life which suited him best and hung up a little picture of his cousin in his sitting room amidst the french prints the favourite actresses and dancers the racing and coaching works of art which suited his taste and formed his gallery <\s>
<s> it was an insignificant little picture representing a simple round face with ringlets and it made as it must be confessed a very poor figure by the side of mademoiselle petitot dancing over a rainbow or mademoiselle redowa grinning in red boots and a lancer's cap <\s>
<s> being engaged and disposed of lady ann milton did not go out so much in the world as her sisters and often stayed at home in london at the parental house in gaunt square when her mamma with the other ladies went abroad <\s>
<s> they talked and they danced with one man after another and the men came and went and the stories about them were various <\s>
<s> but there was only this one story about ann she was engaged to harry foker she never was to think about anybody else <\s>
<s> it was not a very amusing story <\s>
<s> well the instant foker awoke on the day after lady clavering's dinner there was blanche's image glaring upon him with its clear grey eyes and winning smile <\s>
<s> there was her tune ringing in his ears yet round about the spot ofttimes i hover ofttimes i hover which poor foker began piteously to hum as he sat up in his bed under the crimson silken coverlet <\s>
<s> opposite him was a french print of a turkish lady and her greek lover surprised by a venerable ottoman the lady's husband on the other wall was a french print of a gentleman and lady riding and kissing each other at full gallop all round the chaste bedroom were more french prints either portraits of gauzy nymphs of the opera or lovely illustrations of the novels or mayhap an english chef d'oeuvre or two in which miss calverley of t <\s>
<s> would be represented in tight pantaloons in her favourite page part or miss rougemont as venus their value enhanced by the signatures of these ladies maria calverley or frederica rougemont inscribed underneath the prints in an exquisite facsimile <\s>
<s> such were the pictures in which honest harry delighted <\s>
<s> he was no worse than many of his neighbours he was an idle jovial kindly fast man about town and if his rooms were rather profusely decorated with works of french art so that simple lady agnes his mamma on entering the apartments where her darling sate enveloped in fragrant clouds of latakia was often bewildered by the novelties which she beheld there why it must be remembered that he was richer than most young men and could better afford to gratify his taste <\s>
<s> a letter from miss calverley written in a very degage style of spelling and handwriting scrawling freely over the filagree paper and commencing by calling mr <\s>
<s> harry her dear hokey pokey fokey lay on his bed table by his side amidst keys sovereigns cigar cases and a bit of verbena which miss amory had given him and reminding him of the arrival of the day when he was to stand that dinner at the elefant and castle at richmond which he had promised a card for a private box at miss rougemont's approaching benefit a bundle of tickets for ben budgeon's night the north lancashire pippin at martin faunce's the three cornered hat in st <\s>
<s> martin's lane where conkey sam dick the nailor and deadman the worcestershire nobber would put on the gloves and the lovers of the good old british sport were invited to attend' these and sundry other memoirs of mr <\s>
<s> foker's pursuits and pleasure lay on the table by his side when he woke <\s>
<s> how faint all these pleasures seemed now <\s>
<s> what did he care for conkey sam or the worcestershire nobber <\s>
<s> what for the french prints ogling him from all sides of the room those regular stunning slap up out and outers <\s>
<s> and calverley spelling bad and calling him hokey fokey confound her impudence <\s>
<s> the idea of being engaged to a dinner at the elephant and castle at richmond with that old woman who was seven and thirty years old if she was a day filled his mind with dreary disgust now instead of that pleasure which he had only yesterday expected to find from the entertainment <\s>
<s> when his fond mamma beheld her boy that morning she remarked on the pallor of his cheek and the general gloom of his aspect <\s>
<s> why do you go on playing billiards at that wicked spratt's <\s>
<s> my dearest child those billiards will kill you i'm sure they will <\s>
<s> it isn't the billiards harry said gloomily <\s>
<s> then it's the dreadful back kitchen said the lady agnes <\s>
<s> i've often thought d'you know harry of writing to the landlady and begging that she would have the kindness to put only very little wine in the negus which you take and see that you have your shawl on before you get into your brougham <\s>
<s> mrs cutts is a most kind motley woman harry said <\s>
<s> but it isn't the back kitchen neither he added with a ghastly sigh <\s>
<s> as lady agnes never denied her son anything and fell into all his ways with the fondest acquiescence she was rewarded by a perfect confidence on young harry's part who never thought to disguise from her a knowledge of the haunts which he frequented and on the contrary brought her home choice anecdotes from the clubs and billiard rooms which the simple lady relished if she did not understand <\s>
<s> my son goes to spratt's she would say to her confidential friends <\s>
<s> all the young men go to spratt's after their balls <\s>
<s> it is de rigueur my dear and they play billiards as they used to play macao and hazard in mr <\s>
<s> yes my dear father often told me that they sate up always until nine o'clock the next morning with mr <\s>
<s> fox at brookes's whom i remember at drnmmington when i was a little girl in a buff waistcoat and black satin small clothes <\s>
<s> my brother erith never played as a young man nor sate up late he had no health for it but my boy must do as everybody does you know <\s>
<s> yes and then he often goes to a place called the back kitchen frequented by all the wits and authors you know whom one does not see in society but whom it is a great privilege and pleasure for harry to meet and there he hears the questions of the day discussed and my dear father often said that it was our duty to encourage literature and he had hoped to see the late dr <\s>
<s> johnson at drummington only dr <\s>
<s> sheridan came over and drank a great deal of wine everybody drank a great deal of wine in those days and papa's wine merchant's bill was ten times as much as erith's is who gets it as he wants it from fortnum and mason's and doesn't keep any stock at all <\s>
<s> that was an uncommon good dinner we had yesterday ma'am the artful harry broke out <\s>
<s> their clear soup's better than ours <\s>
<s> moufflet will put too much taragon into everything <\s>
<s> the supreme de volaille was very good uncommon and the sweets were better than moufflet's sweets <\s>
<s> did you taste the plombiere ma'am and the maraschino jelly <\s>
<s> stunningly good that maraschino jelly <\s>
<s> lady agnes expressed her agreement in these as in almost all other sentiments of her son who continued the artful conversation saying very handsome house that of the claverings <\s>
<s> furniture i should say got up regardless of expense <\s>
<s> magnificent display of plate ma'am <\s>
<s> the lady assented to all these propositions <\s>
<s> very nice people the claverings <\s>
<s> i know what you mean <\s>
<s> ain't distangy exactly but she is very good natured <\s>
<s> oh very mamma said who was herself one of the most good natured of women <\s>
<s> and sir francis he don't talk much before ladies but after dinner he comes out uncommon strong ma'am a highly agreeable well informed man <\s>
<s> when will you ask them to dinner <\s>
<s> look out for an early day ma'am and looking into lady agnes's pocket book he chose a day only a fortnight hence an age that fortnight seemed to the young gentleman when the claverings were to be invited to grosvenor street <\s>
<s> the obedient lady agnes wrote the required invitation <\s>
<s> she was accustomed to do so without consulting her husband who had his own society and habits and who left his wife to see her own friends alone <\s>
<s> harry looked at the card but there was an omission in the invitation which did not please him <\s>
<s> you have not asked miss whatdyecallem miss emery lady clavering's daughter <\s>
<s> oh that little creature <\s>
<s> i think not harry <\s>
<s> we must ask miss amory foker said <\s>
<s> i i want to ask pendennis and and he's very sweet upon her <\s>
<s> don't you think she sings very well ma'am <\s>
<s> i thought her rather forward and didn't listen to her singing <\s>
<s> she only sang at you and mr <\s>
<s> pendennis it seemed to me <\s>
<s> but i will ask her if you wish harry and so miss amory's name was written on the card with her mother's <\s>
<s> this piece of diplomacy being triumphantly executed harry embraced his fond parent with the utmost affection and retired to his own apartments where he stretched himself on his ottoman and lay brooding silently sighing for the day which was to bring the fair miss amory under his paternal roof and devising a hundred wild schemes for meeting her <\s>
<s> on his return from making the grand tour mr <\s>
<s> foker junior had brought with him a polyglot valet who took the place of stoopid and condescended to wait at dinner attired in shirt fronts of worked muslin with many gold studs and chains upon his master and the elders of the family <\s>
<s> this man who was of no particular country and spoke all languages indifferently ill made himself useful to mr <\s>
<s> harry in a variety of ways read all the artless youth's correspondence knew his favourite haunts and the addresses of his acquaintance and officiated at the private dinners which the young gentleman gave <\s>
<s> as harry lay upon his sofa after his interview with his mamma robed in a wonderful dressing gown and puffing his pipe in gloomy silence anatole too must have remarked that something affected his master's spirits though he did not betray any ill bred sympathy with harry's agitation of mind <\s>
<s> when harry began to dress himself in his out of door morning costume he was very hard indeed to please and particularly severe and snappish about his toilet he tried and cursed pantaloons of many different stripes checks and colours all the boots were villainously varnished the shirts too loud in pattern <\s>
<s> he scented his linen and person with peculiar richness this day and what must have been the valet's astonishment when after some blushing and hesitation on harry's part the young gentleman asked i say anatole when i engaged you didn't you hem didn't you say that you could dress hem dress hair <\s>
<s> the valet said yes he could <\s>
<s> cherchy alors une paire de tongs et curly moi un peu mr <\s>
<s> foker said in an easy manner and the valet wondering whether his master was in love or was going masquerading went in search of the articles first from the old butler who waited upon mr <\s>
<s> foker senior on whose bald pate the tongs would have scarcely found a hundred hairs to seize and finally of the lady who had the charge of the meek auburn fronts of the lady agnes <\s>
<s> and the tongs being got monsieur anatole twisted his young master's locks until he had made harry's head as curly as a negro's after which the youth dressed himself with the utmost care and splendour and proceeded to sally out <\s>

<s> the drag was not one of mr <\s>
<s> foker's own equipages but was hired from a livery stable for festive purposes foker however put his own carriage into requisition that morning and for what purpose does the kind reader suppose <\s>
<s> why to drive down to lamb court temple taking grosvenor place by the way which lies in the exact direction of the temple from grosvenor street as everybody knows where he just had the pleasure of peeping upwards at miss amory's pink window curtains having achieved which satisfactory feat he drove off to pen's chambers <\s>
<s> why did he want to see his dear friend pen so much <\s>
<s> why did he yearn and long after him and did it seem necessary to foker's very existence that he should see pen that morning having parted with him in perfect health on the night previous <\s>
<s> pen had lived two years in london and foker had not paid half a dozen visits to his chambers <\s>
<s> what sent him thither now in such a hurry <\s>
<s> what if any young ladies read this page i have only to inform them that when the same mishap befalls them which now had for more than twelve hours befallen harry foker people will grow interesting to them for whom they did not care sixpence on the day before as on the other hand persons of whom they fancied themselves fond will be found to have become insipid and disagreeable <\s>
<s> then you dearest eliza or maria of the other day to whom you wrote letters and sent locks of hair yards long will on a sudden be as indifferent to you as your stupidest relation whilst on the contrary about his relations you will begin to feel such a warm interest <\s>

<s> foker's eyes because if pen was not the rose he yet had been near that fragrant flower of love <\s>

<s> would foker have a pipe and should the laundress go to the cock and get him some beer warrington asked remarking with a pleased surprise the splendid toilet of this scented and shiny booted young aristocrat but foker had not the slightest wish for beer or tobacco he had very important business he rushed away to the pall mall gazette office still bent upon finding pen <\s>
<s> pen had quitted that pace <\s>
<s> foker wanted him that they might go together to call upon lady clavering <\s>
<s> foker went away disconsolate and whiled away an hour or two vaguely at clubs and when it was time to pay a visit he thought it would be but decent and polite to drive to grosvenor place and leave a card upon lady clavering <\s>
<s> he had not the courage to ask to see her when the door was opened he only delivered two cards with mr <\s>
<s> henry foker engraved upon them to jeames in a speechless agony <\s>

<s> as good luck would have it that splendid barouche of lady clavering's which has been inadequately described in a former chapter drove up to her ladyship's door just as foker mounted the pony which was in waiting for him <\s>
<s> he bestrode the fiery animal and dodged about the arch of the green park keeping the carriage well in view until he saw lady clavering enter and with her whose could be that angel form but the enchantress's clad in a sort of gossamer with a pink bonnet and a light blue parasol but miss amory <\s>
<s> the carriage took its fair owners to madame rigodon's cap and lace shop to mrs wolsey's berlin worsted shop who knows to what other resorts of female commerce <\s>
<s> then it went and took ices at hunter's for lady clavering was somewhat florid in her tastes and amusements and not only liked to go abroad in the most showy carriage in london but that the public should see her in it too <\s>

<s> and when the ladies whom he had conveyed alighted at the door of their house and asked their accomplished coachman whether he would not step in and take something to drink he declined with so melancholy an air that they supposed that the governor and he had had a difference or that some calamity had befallen him and he did not tell these people what the cause of his grief was but left mesdames rougemont and calverley unheeding the cries of the latter who hung over her balcony like jezebel and called out to him to ask him to give another party soon <\s>

<s> and now with that perspicuity and ingenuity and enterprise which only belongs to a certain passion mr <\s>

<s> foker whose knowledge of the language as we have heard was not conspicuous appeared in a stall <\s>

<s> foker made his appearance to the surprise of the world and of his mother especially whom he ordered to apply for cards to these parties for which until now he had shown a supreme contempt <\s>
<s> he told the pleased and unsuspicious lady that he went to parties because it was right for him to see the world he told her that he went to the french play because he wanted to perfect himself in the language and there was no such good lesson as a comedy or vaudeville and when one night the astonished lady agnes saw him stand up and dance and complimented him upon his elegance and activity the mendacious little rogue asserted that he had learned to dance in paris whereas anatole knew that his young master used to go off privily to an academy in brewer street and study there for some hours in the morning <\s>
<s> the casino of our modern days was not invented or was in its infancy as yet and gentlemen of mr <\s>
<s> foker's time had not the facilities of acquiring the science of dancing which are enjoyed by our present youth <\s>
<s> old pendennis seldom missed going to church <\s>
<s> he considered it to be his duty as a gentleman to patronise the institution of public worship and that it was quite a correct thing to be seen at church of a sunday <\s>
<s> one day it chanced that he and arthur went thither together the latter who was now in high favour had been to breakfast with his uncle from whose lodging they walked across the park to a church not far from belgrave square <\s>

<s> so she was in the country so she is everywhere <\s>

<s> i should say that the young man at his father's death and old foker's life's devilish bad you know he had a fit at arthur's last year i should say that young foker won't have less than fourteen thousand a year from the brewery besides logwood and norfolk property <\s>

<s> we are almost as great friends as we used to be in our youth and his talk is about blanche amory from morning till night <\s>
<s> i'm sure he's sweet upon her <\s>
<s> i'm sure he is engaged to his cousin and that they will keep the young man to his bargain said the major <\s>
<s> the marriages in these families are affairs of state <\s>
<s> lady agnes was made to marry old foker by the late lord although she was notoriously partial to her cousin who was killed at albuera afterwards and who saved her life out of the lake at drummington <\s>
<s> i remember lady agnes sir an exceedingly fine woman <\s>

<s> foker sate for drummington till the reform bill and paid dev'lish well for his seat too <\s>
<s> and you may depend upon this sir that foker senior who is a parvenu and loves a great man as all parvenus do has ambitious views for his son as well as himself and that your friend harry must do as his father bids him <\s>
<s> i've known a hundred cases of love in young men and women hey master arthur do you take me <\s>
<s> they kick sir they resist they make a deuce of a riot and that sort of thing but they end by listening to reason begad <\s>
<s> blanche is a dangerous girl sir pen said <\s>
<s> i was smitten with her myself once and very far gone too he added but that is years ago <\s>
<s> how far did it go <\s>

<s> pen did not think it fit to tell his uncle all the particulars of that courtship which had passed between himself and the young lady <\s>
<s> a man might go farther and fare worse arthur the major said still looking queerly at his nephew <\s>

<s> what's ten thousand pound and a girl bred up like her <\s>
<s> you use my own words and it is all very well <\s>
<s> but i tell you in confidence pen in strict honour mind that it's my belief she has a devilish deal more than ten thousand pound and from what i saw of her the other day and and have heard of her i should say she was a devilish accomplished clever girl and would make a good wife with a sensible husband <\s>
<s> how do you know about her money <\s>
<s> you seem to have information about everybody and to know about all the town <\s>
<s> i do know a few things sir and i don't tell all i know <\s>

<s> and the major looked still more knowingly and still harder at pen <\s>
<s> well sir he said to his godfather and namesake make her mrs <\s>
<s> you can do it as well as i <\s>
<s> you are laughing at me sir the other replied rather peevishly and you ought not to laugh so near a church gate <\s>
<s> here we are at st <\s>
<s> oriel is a beautiful preacher <\s>
<s> indeed the bells were tolling the people were trooping into the handsome church the carriages of the inhabitants of the lordly quarter poured forth their pretty loads of devotees in whose company pen and his uncle ending their edifying conversation entered the fane <\s>
<s> i do not know whether other people carry their worldly affairs to the church door <\s>
<s> arthur who from habitual reverence and feeling was always more than respectful in a place of worship thought of the incongruity of their talk perhaps whilst the old gentleman at his side was utterly unconscious of any such contrast <\s>
<s> his hat was brushed his wig was trim his neckcloth was perfectly tied <\s>
<s> he looked at every soul in the congregation it is true the bald heads and the bonnets the flowers and the feathers but so demurely that he hardly lifted up his eyes from his book from his book which he could not read without glasses <\s>
<s> as for pen's gravity it was sorely put to the test when upon looking by chance towards the seats where the servants were collected he spied out by the side of a demure gentleman in plush henry foker esquire who had discovered this place of devotion <\s>
<s> following the direction of harry's eye which strayed a good deal from his book pen found that it alighted upon a yellow bonnet and a pink one and that these bonnets were on the heads of lady clavering and blanche amory <\s>
<s> if pen's uncle is not the only man who has talked about his worldly affairs up to the church door is poor harry foker the only one who has brought his worldly love into the aisle <\s>
<s> when the congregation issued forth at the conclusion of the service foker was out amongst the first but pen came up with him presently as he was hankering about the entrance which he was unwilling to leave until my lady's barouche with the bewigged coachman had borne away its mistress and her daughter from their devotions <\s>
<s> when the two ladies came out they found together the pendennises uncle and nephew and harry foker esquire sucking the crook of his stick standing there in the sunshine <\s>
<s> to see and to ask to eat were simultaneous with the good natured begum and she invited the three gentlemen to luncheon straightway <\s>
<s> blanche was too particularly gracious <\s>
<s> do come she said to arthur if you are not too great a man <\s>
<s> i want so to talk to you about but we mustn't say what here you know <\s>
<s> and the young devotee jumped into the carriage after her mamma i've read every word of it <\s>
<s> it's adorable she added still addressing herself to pen <\s>
<s> i know who is said mr <\s>

<s> a review in pall mall walter lorraine <\s>
<s> what the doose do you mean <\s>
<s> walter lorraine died of the measles poor little beggar when we were at grey friars <\s>
<s> i remember his mother coming up <\s>

<s> you must know i have been writing a novel and some of the papers have spoken very well of it <\s>
<s> perhaps you don't read the sunday papers <\s>
<s> i read bell's life regular old boy mr foker answered at which pen laughed again and the three gentlemen proceeded in great good humour to lady clavering's house <\s>
<s> the subject of the novel was resumed after luncheon by miss amory who indeed loved poets and men of letters if she loved anything and was sincerely an artist in feeling <\s>
<s> some of the passages in the book made me cry positively they did she said <\s>
<s> pen said with some fatuity i am happy to think i have a part of vos larmes miss blanche and the major who had not read more than six pages of pen's book put on his sanctified look saying yes there are some passages quite affecting mons'ous affecting and oh if it makes you cry lady amory declared she would not read it that she wouldn't <\s>
<s> don't mamma blanche said with a french shrug of her shoulders and then she fell into a rhapsody about the book about the snatches of poetry interspersed in it about the two heroines leonora and neaera about the two heroes walter lorraine and his rival the young duke and what good company you introduce us to said the young lady archly quel ton <\s>
<s> how much of your life have you passed at court and are you a prime minister's son mr <\s>
<s> pen began to laugh it is as cheap for a novelist to create a duke as to make a baronet he said <\s>
<s> shall i tell you a secret miss amory <\s>
<s> i promoted all my characters at the request of the publisher <\s>
<s> the young duke was only a young baron when the novel was first written his false friend the viscount was a simple commoner and so on with all the characters of the story <\s>
<s> what a wicked satirical pert young man you have become <\s>
<s> comme vous voila forme <\s>
<s> said the young lady <\s>
<s> how different from arthur pendennis of the country <\s>
<s> i think i like arthur pendennis of the country best though <\s>
<s> and she gave him the full benefit of her eyes both of the fond appealing glance into his own and of the modest look downwards towards the carpet which showed off her dark eyelids and long fringed lashes <\s>
<s> pen of course protested that he had not changed in the least to which the young lady replied by a tender sigh and thinking that she had done quite enough to make arthur happy or miserable as the case might be she proceeded to cajole his companion mr <\s>
<s> harry foker who during the literary conversation had sate silently imbibing the head of his cane and wishing that he was a clever chap like that pen <\s>
<s> if the major thought that by telling miss amory of mr <\s>

<s> she became only the more gracious to foker she praised him and everything belonging to him she praised his mamma she praised the pony which he rode in the park she praised the lovely breloques or gimcracks which the young gentleman wore at his watch chain and that dear little darling of a cane and those dear little delicious monkeys heads with ruby eyes which ornamented harry's shirt and formed the buttons of his waistcoat <\s>
<s> and then having praised and coaxed the weak youth until he blushed and tingled with pleasure and until pen thought she really had gone quite far enough she took another theme <\s>
<s> i am afraid mr <\s>
<s> foker is a very sad young man she said turning round to pen <\s>
<s> he does not look so pen answered with a sneer <\s>
<s> i mean we have heard sad stories about him <\s>
<s> poyntz saying here the other day about that party at richmond <\s>
<s> o you naughty creature <\s>

<s> the dinner was ordered at greenwich and foker though he did not invite miss amory had some delicious opportunities of conversation with her during the repast and afterwards on the balcony of their room at the hotel and again during the drive home in her ladyship's barouche <\s>

<s> i am an old soldier begad he said and i learned in early life to make myself comfortable <\s>
<s> and being an old soldier he allowed the two young men to pay for the dinner between them and all the way home in the brougham he rallied pen about miss amory's evident partiality for him praised her good looks spirits and wit and again told pen in the strictest confidence that she would be a devilish deal richer than people thought <\s>
<s> contains a novel incident some account has been given in a former part of this story how mr <\s>
<s> pen during his residence at home after his defeat at oxbridge had occupied himself with various literary compositions and amongst other works had written the greater part of a novel <\s>
<s> this book written under the influence of his youthful embarrassments amatory and pecuniary was of a very fierce gloomy and passionate sort the byronic despair the wertherian despondency the mocking bitterness of mephistopheles of faust were all reproduced and developed in the character of the hero for our youth had just been learning the german language and imitated as almost all clever lads do his favourite poets and writers <\s>
<s> passages in the volumes once so loved and now read so seldom still bear the mark of the pencil with which he noted them in those days <\s>
<s> tears fell upon the leaf of the book perhaps or blistered the pages of his manuscript as the passionate young man dashed his thoughts down <\s>
<s> if he took up the books afterwards he had no ability or wish to sprinkle the leaves with that early dew of former times his pencil was no longer eager to score its marks of approval but as he looked over the pages of his manuscript he remembered what had been overflowing feelings which had caused him to blot it and the pain which had inspired the line <\s>
<s> if the secret history of books could be written and the author's private thoughts and meanings noted down alongside of his story how many insipid volumes would become interesting and dull tales excite the reader <\s>
<s> many a bitter smile passed over pen's face as he read his novel and recalled the time and feelings which gave it birth <\s>
<s> how pompous some of the grand passages appeared and how weak were others in which he thought he had expressed his full heart <\s>
<s> this page was imitated from a then favourite author as he could now clearly see and confess though he had believed himself to be writing originally then <\s>
<s> as he mused over certain lines he recollected the place and hour where he wrote them the ghost of the dead feeling came back as he mused and he blushed to review the faint image <\s>
<s> and what meant those blots on the page <\s>
<s> as you come in the desert to a ground where camels hoofs are marked in the clay and traces of withered herbage are yet visible you know that water was there once so the place in pen's mind was no longer green and the fons lacrymarum was dried up <\s>
<s> he used this simile one morning to warrington as the latter sate over his pipe and book and pen with much gesticulation according to his wont when excited and with a bitter laugh thumped his manuscript down on the table making the tea things rattle and the blue milk dance in the jug <\s>
<s> on the previous night he had taken the manuscript out of a long neglected chest containing old shooting jackets old oxbridge scribbling books his old surplice and battered cap and gown and other memorials of youth school and home <\s>
<s> he read in the volume in bed until he fell asleep for the commencement of the tale was somewhat dull and he had come home tired from a london evening party <\s>
<s> said pen thumping down his papers when i think that these were written but very few years ago i am ashamed of my memory <\s>
<s> i wrote this when i believed myself be eternally in love with that little coquette miss amory <\s>
<s> i used to carry down verses to her and put them into the hollow of a tree and dedicate them amori that was a sweet little play upon words warrington remarked with a puff amory amori <\s>
<s> it showed proof of scholarship <\s>
<s> let us hear a bit of the rubbish <\s>
<s> and he stretched over from his easy chair and caught hold of pen's manuscript with the fire tongs which he was just using in order to put a coal into his pipe <\s>
<s> thus in possession of the volume he began to read out from the leaves from the life book of walter lorraine <\s>
<s> false as thou art beautiful <\s>

<s> leonora who marries the duke is the fotheringay <\s>
<s> i drew the duke from magnus charters with whom i was at oxford it's a little like him and miss amory is neaera <\s>

<s> i thought of her as i walked home from lady whiston's in the moonlight and the whole early scenes came back to me as if they had been yesterday <\s>
<s> and when i got home i pulled out the story which i wrote about her and the other three years ago do you know outrageous as it is it has some good stuff in it and if bungay won't publish it i think bacon will <\s>
<s> that's the way of poets said warrington <\s>
<s> they fall in love jilt or are jilted they suffer and they cry out that they suffer more than any other mortals and when they have experienced feelings enough they note them down in a book and take the book to market <\s>
<s> all poets are humbugs all literary men are humbugs directly a man begins to sell his feelings for money he's a humbug <\s>
<s> if a poet gets a pain in his side from too good a dinner he bellows ai ai louder than prometheus <\s>
<s> i suppose a poet has a greater sensibility than another man said pen with some spirit <\s>
<s> that is what makes him a poet <\s>
<s> i suppose that he sees and feels more keenly it is that which makes him speak of what he feels and sees <\s>
<s> you speak eagerly enough in your leading articles when you espy a false argument in an opponent or detect a quack in the house <\s>
<s> paley who does not care for anything else in the world will talk for an hour about a question of law <\s>
<s> give another the privilege which you take yourself and the free use of his faculty and let him be what nature has made him <\s>
<s> why should not a man sell his sentimental thoughts as well as you your political ideas or paley his legal knowledge <\s>
<s> each alike is a matter of experience and practice <\s>
<s> it is not money which causes you to perceive a fallacy or paley to argue a point but a natural or acquired aptitude for that kind of truth and a poet sets down his thoughts and experiences upon paper as a painter does a landscape or a face upon canvas to the best of his ability and according to his particular gift <\s>
<s> if ever i think i have the stuff in me to write an epic by jove i will try if i only feel that i am good enough to crack a joke or tell a story i will do that <\s>
<s> not a bad speech young one warrington said but that does not prevent all poets from being humbugs <\s>
<s> what homer aeschylus shakspeare and all <\s>
<s> their names are not to be breathed in the same sense with you pigmies mr <\s>
<s> warrington said there are men and men sir <\s>
<s> well shakspeare was a man who wrote for money just as you and i do pen answered at which warrington confounded his impudence and resumed his pipe and his manuscript <\s>
<s> there was not the slightest doubt then that this document contained a great deal of pen's personal experiences and that leaves from the life book of walter lorraine would never have been written but for arthur pendennis's own private griefs passions and follies <\s>
<s> as we have become acquainted with these in the first volume of his biography it will not be necessary to make large extracts from the novel of walter lorraine in which the young gentleman had depicted such of them as he thought were likely to interest the reader or were suitable for the purpose of his story <\s>
<s> now though he had kept it in his box for nearly half of the period during which according to the horatian maxim a work of art ought to lie ripening a maxim the truth of which may by the way be questioned altogether mr <\s>
<s> pen had not buried his novel for this time in order that the work might improve but because he did not know where else to bestow it or had no particular desire to see it <\s>
<s> a man who thinks of putting away a composition for ten years before he shall give it to the world or exercise his own maturer judgment upon it had best be very sure of the original strength and durability of the work otherwise on withdrawing it from its crypt he may find that like small wine it has lost what flavour it once had and is only tasteless when opened <\s>
<s> there are works of all tastes and smacks the small and the strong those that improve by age and those that won't bear keeping at all but are pleasant at the first draught when they refresh and sparkle <\s>
<s> now pen had never any notion even in the time of his youthful inexperience and fervour of imagination that the story he was writing was a masterpiece of composition or that he was the equal of the great authors whom he admired and when he now reviewed his little performance he was keenly enough alive to its faults and pretty modest regarding its merits <\s>
<s> it was not very good he thought but it was as good as most books of the kind that had the run of circulating libraries and the career of the season <\s>
<s> he had critically examined more than one fashionable novel by the authors of the day then popular and he thought that his intellect was as good as theirs and that he could write the english language as well as those ladies or gentlemen and as he now ran over his early performance he was pleased to find here and there passages exhibiting both fancy and vigour and traits if not of genius of genuine passion and feeling <\s>
<s> this too was warrington's verdict when that severe critic after half an hour's perusal of the manuscript and the consumption of a couple of pipes of tobacco laid pen's book down yawning portentously <\s>
<s> i can't read any more of that balderdash now he said but it seems to me there is some good stuff in it pen my boy <\s>
<s> there's a certain greenness and freshness in it which i like somehow <\s>
<s> the bloom disappears off the face of poetry after you begin to shave <\s>
<s> you can't get up that naturalness and artless rosy tint in after days <\s>
<s> your cheeks are pale and have got faded by exposure to evening parties and you are obliged to take curling irons and macassar and the deuce knows what to your whiskers they curl ambrosially and you are very grand and genteel and so forth but ah <\s>
<s> pen the spring time was the best <\s>
<s> what the deuce have my whiskers to do with the subject in hand <\s>
<s> pen said who perhaps may have been nettled by warrington's allusion to those ornaments which to say the truth the young man coaxed and curled and oiled and perfumed and petted in rather an absurd manner <\s>
<s> do you think we can do anything with walter lorraine <\s>
<s> shall we take him to the publishers or make an auto da fe of him <\s>
<s> i don't see what is the good of incremation warrington said though i have a great mind to put him into the fire to punish your atrocious humbug and hypocrisy <\s>
<s> shall i burn him indeed <\s>
<s> you have much too great a value for him to hurt a hair of his head <\s>
<s> here goes said pen and walter lorraine went off the table and was flung on to the coals <\s>
<s> but the fire having done its duty of boiling the young man's breakfast kettle had given up work for the day and had gone out as pen knew very well warrington with a scornful mile once more took up the manuscript with the tongs from out of the harmless cinders <\s>
<s> oh pen what a humbug you are <\s>
<s> warrington said and what is worst of all sir a clumsy humbug <\s>
<s> i saw you look to see that the fire was out before you sent walter lorraine behind the bars <\s>
<s> no we won't burn him we will carry him to the egyptians and sell him <\s>
<s> we will exchange him away for money yea for silver and gold and for beef and for liquors and for tobacco and for raiment <\s>
<s> this youth will fetch some price in the market for he is a comely lad though not over strong but we will fatten him up and give him the bath and curl his hair and we will sell him for a hundred piasters to bacon or to bungay <\s>
<s> the rubbish is saleable enough sir and my advice to you is this the next time you go home for a holiday take walter lorraine in your carpet bag give him a more modern air prune away though sparingly some of the green passages and add a little comedy and cheerfulness and satire and that sort of thing and then we'll take him to market and sell him <\s>
<s> the book is not a wonder of wonders but it will do very well <\s>
<s> do you think so warrington <\s>
<s> said pen delighted for this was great praise from his cynical friend <\s>
<s> you silly young fool <\s>
<s> i think it's uncommonly clever warrington said in a kind voice <\s>
<s> so do you sir <\s>
<s> and with the manuscript which he held in his hand he playfully struck pen on the cheek <\s>
<s> that part of pen's countenance turned as red as it had ever done in the earliest days of his blushes he grasped the other's hand and said thank you warrington with all his might and then he retired to his own room with his book and passed the greater part of the day upon his bed re reading it and he did as warrington had advised and altered not a little and added a great deal until at length he had fashioned walter lorraine pretty much into the shape in which as the respected novel reader knows it subsequently appeared <\s>
<s> whilst he was at work upon this performance the good natured warrington artfully inspired the two gentlemen who read for messrs <\s>
<s> bacon and bungay with the greatest curiosity regarding walter lorraine and pointed out the peculiar merits of its distinguished author <\s>
<s> it was at the period when the novel called the fashionable was in vogue among us and warrington did not fail to point out as before how pen was a man of the very first fashion himself and received at the houses of some of the greatest personages in the land <\s>
<s> the simple and kind hearted percy popjoy was brought to bear upon mrs <\s>
<s> bungay whom he informed that his friend pendennis was occupied upon a work of the most exciting nature a work that the whole town would run after full of wit genius satire pathos and every conceivable good quality <\s>
<s> we have said before that bungay knew no more about novels than he did about hebrew or algebra and neither read nor understood any of the books which he published and paid for but he took his opinions from his professional advisers and from mrs <\s>
<s> b and evidently with a view to a commercial transaction asked pendennis and warrington to dinner again <\s>
<s> bacon when he found that bungay was about to treat of course began to be anxious and curious and desired to outbid his rival <\s>
<s> was anything settled between mr <\s>
<s> pendennis and the odious house over the way about the new book <\s>
<s> hack the confidential reader was told to make inquiries and see if any thing was to be done and the result of the inquiries of that diplomatist was that one morning bacon himself toiled up the staircase of lamb court and to the door on which the names of mr <\s>
<s> for a gentleman of fashion as poor pen was represented to be it must be confessed that the apartments he and his friend occupied were not very suitable <\s>
<s> the ragged carpet had grown only more ragged during the two years of joint occupancy a constant odour of tobacco perfumed the sitting room bacon tumbled over the laundress's buckets in the passage through which he had to pass warrington's shooting jacket was as tattered at the elbows as usual and the chair which bacon was requested to take on entering broke down with the publisher <\s>
<s> warrington burst out laughing said that bacon had got the game chair and bawled out to pen to fetch a sound one from his bedroom <\s>
<s> and seeing the publisher looking round the dingy room with an air of profound pity and wonder asked him whether he didn't think the apartments were elegant and if he would like for mrs <\s>
<s> bacon's drawing room any of the articles of furniture <\s>
<s> warrington's character as a humourist was known to mr <\s>
<s> bacon i never can make that chap out the publisher was heard to say or tell whether he is in earnest or only chaffing <\s>
<s> it is very possible that mr <\s>
<s> bacon would have set the two gentlemen down as impostors altogether but that there chanced to be on the breakfast table certain cards of invitation which the post of the morning had brought in for pen and which happened to come from some very exalted personage of the beau monde into which our young man had his introduction <\s>
<s> looking down upon these bacon saw that the marchioness of steyne would be at home to mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis upon a given day and that another lady of distinction proposed to have dancing at her house upon a certain future evening <\s>
<s> warrington saw the admiring publisher eyeing these documents <\s>
<s> ah said he with an air of simplicity pendennis is one of the most affable young men i ever knew mr <\s>
<s> here is a young fellow that dines with all the men in london and yet he'll take his mutton chop with you and me quite contentedly <\s>
<s> there's nothing like the affability of the old english gentleman <\s>
<s> oh no nothing said mr <\s>
<s> and you wonder why he should go on living up three pair of stairs with me don't you now <\s>
<s> well it is a queer taste <\s>
<s> but we are fond of each other and as i can't afford to live in a great house he comes and stays in these rickety old chambers with me <\s>
<s> he's a man that can afford to live anywhere <\s>
<s> i fancy it don't cost him much here thought mr <\s>
<s> bacon and the object of these praises presently entered the room from his adjacent sleeping apartment <\s>
<s> bacon began to speak upon the subject of his visit said he heard that mr <\s>
<s> pendennis had a manuscript novel professed himself anxious to have a sight of that work and had no doubt that they could come to terms respecting it <\s>
<s> what would be his price for it <\s>
<s> would he give bacon the refusal of it <\s>
<s> he would find our house a liberal house and so forth <\s>
<s> the delighted pen assumed an air of indifference and said that he was already in treaty with bungay and could give no definite answer <\s>
<s> this piqued the other into such liberal though vague offers that pen began to fancy eldorado was opening to him and that his fortune was made from that day <\s>
<s> i shall not mention what was the sum of money which mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis finally received for the first edition of his novel of walter lorraine lest other young literary aspirants should expect to be as lucky as he was and unprofessional persons forsake their own callings whatever they may be for the sake of supplying the world with novels whereof there is already a sufficiency <\s>
<s> let no young people be misled and rush fatally into romance writing for one book which succeeds let them remember the many that fail i do not say deservedly or otherwise and wholesomely abstain or if they venture at least let them do so at their own peril <\s>
<s> as for those who have already written novels this warning is not addressed of course to them <\s>
<s> let them take their wares to market let them apply to bacon and bungay and all the publishers in the row or the metropolis and may they be happy in their ventures <\s>
<s> this world is so wide and the tastes of mankind happily so various that there is always a chance for every man and he may win the prize by his genius or by his good fortune <\s>
<s> but what is the chance of success or failure of obtaining popularity or of holding it when achieved <\s>
<s> one man goes over the ice which bears him and a score who follow flounder in <\s>
<s> pendennis's was an exceptional case and applies to himself only and i assert solemnly and will to the last maintain that it is one thing to write a novel and another to get money for it <\s>
<s> by merit then or good fortune or the skilful playing off of bungay against bacon which warrington performed and which an amateur novelist is quite welcome to try upon any two publishers in the trade pen's novel was actually sold for a certain sum of money to one of the two eminent patrons of letters whom we have introduced to our readers <\s>
<s> the sum was so considerable that pen thought of opening an account at a banker's or of keeping a cab and horse or of descending into the first floor of lamb court into newly furnished apartments or of migrating to the fashionable end of the town <\s>
<s> major pendennis advised the latter move strongly he opened his eyes with wonder when he heard of the good luck that had befallen pen and which the latter as soon as it occurred hastened eagerly to communicate to his uncle <\s>
<s> the major was almost angry that pen should have earned so much money <\s>
<s> who the doose reads this kind of thing <\s>
<s> he thought to himself when he heard of the bargain which pen had made <\s>
<s> i never read your novels and rubbish <\s>
<s> except paul de kock who certainly makes me laugh i don't think i've looked into a book of the sort these thirty years <\s>
<s> pen's a lucky fellow <\s>
<s> i should think he might write one of these in a month now say a month that's twelve in a year <\s>
<s> dammy he may go on spinning this nonsense for the next four to five years and make a fortune <\s>
<s> in the meantime i should wish him to live properly take respectable apartments and keep a brougham <\s>
<s> and on this simple calculation it was that the major counselled pen <\s>
<s> arthur laughing told warrington what his uncle's advice had been but he luckily had a much more reasonable counsellor than the old gentleman in the person of his friend and in his own conscience which said to him be grateful for this piece of good fortune don't plunge into any extravagancies <\s>
<s> and he wrote a letter to her in which he told her his thanks and his regard and enclosed to her such an instalment of his debt as nearly wiped it off <\s>

<s> pendennis ma'am i shall order a copy of the book for myself and another at the book club <\s>
<s> we may be sure that the widow and laura walked out to meet the mail which brought them their copy of pen's precious novel as soon as that work was printed and ready for delivery to the public and that they read it to each other and that they also read it privately and separately for when the widow came out of her room in her dressing gown at one o'clock in the morning with volume two which she had finished she found laura devouring volume three in bed <\s>
<s> laura did not say much about the book but helen pronounced that it was a happy mixture of shakspeare and byron and walter scott and was quite certain that her son was the greatest genius as he was the best son in the world <\s>
<s> did laura not think about the book and the author although she said so little <\s>
<s> at least she thought about arthur pendennis <\s>
<s> kind as his tone was it vexed her <\s>
<s> she did not like his eagerness to repay that money <\s>
<s> she would rather that her brother had taken her gift as she intended it and was pained that there should be money calculations between them <\s>
<s> his letters from london written with the good natured wish to amuse his mother were full of descriptions of the famous people and the entertainments and magnificence of the great city <\s>

<s> pynsent supposed to be so cold and so ambitious had formally offered his hand to miss bell <\s>
<s> no one except herself and her admirer knew of this proposal or that pynsent had been rejected by her and probably the reasons she gave to the mortified young man himself were not those which actuated her refusal or those which she chose to acknowledge to herself <\s>
<s> i never she told pynsent can accept such an offer as that which you make me which you own is unknown to your family as i am sure it would be unwelcome to them <\s>

<s> when at length the famous novel appeared it not only met with applause from more impartial critics than mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis but luckily for pen it suited the taste of the public and obtained a quick and considerable popularity before two months were over pen had the satisfaction and surprise of seeing the second edition of walter lorraine advertised in the newspapers and enjoyed the pleasure of reading and sending home the critiques of various literary journals and reviewers upon his book <\s>
<s> their censure did not much affect him for the good natured young man was disposed to accept with considerable humility the dispraises of others <\s>
<s> nor did their praise elate him over much for like most honest persons he had his own opinion about his own performance and when a critic praised him in the wrong place he was rather hurt than pleased by the compliment <\s>

<s> sir charles was a weak man he was old and had many infirmities he cried about his father in law to his wife whom he adored with senile infatuation he said he must go abroad he must go and live in the country he should die or have another fit if he saw that man again he knew he should <\s>
<s> and it was only by paying a second visit to captain costigan and representing to him that if he plagued sir charles by letters or addressed him in the street or made any further applications for loans his allowance would be withdrawn altogether that lady mirabel was enabled to keep her papa in order and to restore tranquillity to her husband <\s>
<s> and on occasion of this visit she sternly rebuked bows for not keeping a better watch over the captain desired that he should not be allowed to drink in that shameful way and that the people at the horrid taverns which he frequented should be told upon no account to give him credit <\s>
<s> papa's conduct is bringing me to the grave she said though she looked perfectly healthy and you as an old man mr <\s>
<s> bows and one that pretended to have a regard for us ought to be ashamed of abetting him in it <\s>

<s> no name at all is over their door <\s>

<s> james's or leadenhall street but is here on a confidential mission quite independent of the east india company or the board of control <\s>
<s> in fact strong says colonel altamont's object being financial and to effectuate a sale of some of the principal diamonds and rubies of the lucknow crown his wish is not to report himself at the india house or in cannon row but rather to negotiate with private capitalists with whom he has had important transactions both in this country and on the continent <\s>
<s> we have said that these anonymous chambers of strong's had been very comfortably furnished since the arrival of sir francis clavering in london and the chevalier might boast with reason to the friends who visited him that few retired captains were more snugly quartered than he in his crib in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> there were three rooms below the office where strong transacted his business whatever that might be and where still remained the desk and railings of the departed officials who had preceded him and the chevalier's own bedroom and sitting room and a private stair led out of the office to two upper apartments the one occupied by colonel altamont and the other serving as the kitchen of the establishment and the bedroom of mr <\s>
<s> these rooms were on a level with the apartments of our friends bows and costigan next door at no <\s>

<s> 3 were all skilled in the culinary art <\s>
<s> grady was great at an irish stew the colonel was famous for pillaus and curries and as for strong he could cook anything <\s>
<s> he made french dishes and spanish dishes stews fricassees and omelettes to perfection nor was there any man in england more hospitable than he when his purse was full or his credit was good <\s>
<s> at those happy periods he could give a friend as he said a good dinner a good glass of wine and a good song afterwards and poor cos often heard with envy the roar of strong's choruses and the musical clinking of the glasses as he sate in his own room so far removed and yet so near to those festivities <\s>
<s> it was not expedient to invite mr <\s>
<s> costigan always his practice of inebriation was lamentable and he bored strong's guests with his stories when sober and with his maudlin tears when drunk <\s>
<s> a strange and motley set they were these friends of the chevalier and though major pendennis would not much have relished their company arthur and warrington liked it not a little and pen thought it as amusing as the society of the finest gentlemen in the finest houses which he had the honour to frequent <\s>
<s> there was a history about every man of the set they seemed all to have had their tides of luck and bad fortune <\s>
<s> most of them had wonderful schemes and speculations in their pockets and plenty for making rapid and extraordinary fortunes <\s>
<s> jack holt had been in don carlos's army when ned strong had fought on the other side and was now organising a little scheme for smuggling tobacco into london which must bring thirty thousand a year to any man who would advance fifteen hundred just to bribe the last officer of the excise who held out and had wind of the scheme <\s>

<s> keightley the manager of the tredyddlum and polwheedle copper mines which were as yet under water besides singing as good a second as any professional man and besides the tredyddlum office had a smyrna sponge company and a little quicksilver operation in view which would set him straight with the world yet <\s>
<s> filby had been everything a corporal of dragoons a field preacher and missionary agent for converting the irish an actor at a greenwich fair booth in front of which his father's attorney found him when the old gentleman died and left him that famous property from which he got no rents now and of which nobody exactly knew the situation <\s>
<s> added to these was sir francis clavering bart who liked their society though he did not much add to its amusements by his convivial powers <\s>
<s> but he was made much of by the company now on account of his wealth and position in the world <\s>
<s> he told his little story and sang his little song or two with great affability and he had had his own history too before his accession to good fortune and had seen the inside of more prisons than one and written his name on many a stamped paper <\s>
<s> when altamont first returned from paris and after he had communicated with sir francis clavering from the hotel at which he had taken up his quarters and which he had reached in a very denuded state considering the wealth of diamonds and rubies with which this honest man was entrusted strong was sent to his patron by the baronet paid his little bill at the inn and invited him to come and sleep for a night or two at the chambers where he subsequently took up his residence <\s>
<s> to negotiate with this man was very well but to have such a person settled in his rooms and to be constantly burthened with such society did not suit the chevalier's taste much and he grumbled not a little to his principal <\s>
<s> i wish you would put this bear into somebody else's cage he said to clavering <\s>
<s> the fellow's no gentleman <\s>
<s> i don't like walking with him <\s>

<s> when he died altamont began to cry like a child and said it was a d  d shame and cried and swore so that there was another row and everybody laughing <\s>
<s> then i had to take him away because he wanted to take his coat off to one fellow who laughed at him and bellowed to him to stand up like a man who is he <\s>
<s> where the deuce does he come from <\s>
<s> you had best tell me the whole story <\s>
<s> frank you must one day <\s>
<s> you and he have robbed a church together that's my belief <\s>
<s> you had better get it off your mind at once clavering and tell me what this altamont is and what hold he has over you <\s>
<s> i wish he was dead <\s>
<s> was the baronet's only reply and his countenance became so gloomy that strong did not think fit to question his patron any further at that time but resolved if need were to try and discover for himself what was the secret tie between altamont and clavering <\s>
<s> in which the colonel narrates some of his adventures early in the forenoon of the day after the dinner in grosvenor place at which colonel altamont had chosen to appear the colonel emerged from his chamber in the upper story at shepherd's inn and entered into strong's sitting room where the chevalier sate in his easy chair with the newspaper and his cigar <\s>
<s> he was a man who made his tent comfortable wherever he pitched it and long before altamont's arrival had done justice to a copious breakfast of fried eggs and broiled rashers which mr <\s>
<s> grady had prepared secundum artem <\s>
<s> good humoured and talkative he preferred any company rather than none and though he had not the least liking for his fellow lodger and would not have grieved to hear that the accident had befallen him which sir francis clavering desired so fervently yet kept on fair terms with him <\s>
<s> he had seen altamont to bed with great friendliness on the night previous and taken away his candle for fear of accidents and finding a spirit bottle empty upon which he had counted for his nocturnal refreshment had drunk a glass of water with perfect contentment over his pipe before he turned into his own crib and to sleep <\s>
<s> that enjoyment never failed him he had always an easy temper a faultless digestion and a rosy cheek and whether he was going into action the next morning or to prison and both had been his lot in the camp or the fleet the worthy captain snored healthfully through the night and woke with a good heart and appetite for the struggles or difficulties or pleasures of the day <\s>
<s> the first act of colonel altamont was to bellow to grady for a pint of pale ale the which he first poured into a pewter flagon whence he transferred it to his own lips <\s>
<s> he put down the tankard empty drew a great breath wiped his mouth in his dressing gown the difference of the colour of his beard from his dyed whiskers had long struck captain strong who had seen too that his hair was fair under his black wig but made no remarks upon these circumstances the colonel drew a great breath and professed himself immensely refreshed by his draught <\s>
<s> nothing like that beer he remarked when the coppers are hot <\s>
<s> many a day i've drunk a dozen of bass at calcutta and and and at lucknow i suppose strong said with a laugh <\s>
<s> i got the beer for you on purpose knew you'd want it after last night <\s>
<s> and the colonel began to talk about his adventures of the preceding evening <\s>
<s> i cannot help myself the colonel said beating his head with his big hand <\s>
<s> i'm a madman when i get the liquor on board me and ain't fit to be trusted with a spirit bottle <\s>
<s> when i once begin i can't stop till i've emptied it and when i've swallowed it lord knows what i say or what i don't say <\s>
<s> i dined at home here quite quiet <\s>
<s> grady gave me just my two tumblers and i intended to pass the evening at the black and red as sober as a parson <\s>
<s> why did you leave that confounded sample bottle of hollands out of the cupboard strong <\s>
<s> grady must go out too and leave me the kettle a boiling for tea <\s>
<s> it was of no use i couldn't keep away from it <\s>
<s> washed it all down sir by jove <\s>
<s> and it's my belief i had some more too afterwards at that infernal little thieves den <\s>
<s> what were you there too <\s>
<s> strong asked and before you came to grosvenor place <\s>
<s> that was beginning betimes <\s>
<s> early hours to be drunk and cleared out before nine o'clock eh <\s>
<s> but so it was <\s>
<s> yes like a great big fool i must go there and found the fellows dining blackland and young moss and two or three more of the thieves <\s>
<s> if we'd gone to rouge et noir i must have won <\s>
<s> but we didn't try the black and red <\s>
<s> no hang em they know'd i'd have beat em at that i must have beat em i can't help beating em i tell you <\s>
<s> but they was too cunnin for me <\s>
<s> that rascal blackland got the bones out and we played hazard on the dining table <\s>
<s> and i dropped all the money i had from you in the morning be hanged to my luck <\s>
<s> it was that that set me wild and i suppose i must have been very hot about the head for i went off thinking to get some more money from clavering i recollect and then and then i don't much remember what happened till i woke this morning and heard old bows at no <\s>
<s> 4 playing on his pianner <\s>
<s> strong mused for a while as he lighted his cigar with a coal i should like to know how you always draw money from clavering colonel he said <\s>
<s> the colonel burst out with a laugh ha ha <\s>
<s> he owes it me he said <\s>
<s> i don't know that that's a reason with frank for paying strong answered <\s>
<s> he owes plenty besides you <\s>
<s> well he gives it me because he is so fond of me the other said with the same grinning sneer <\s>
<s> he loves me like a brother you know he does captain no he don't well perhaps he don't and if you ask me no questions perhaps i'll tell you no lies captain strong put that in your pipe and smoke it my boy <\s>
<s> but i'll give up that confounded brandy bottle the colonel continued after a pause <\s>
<s> i must give it up or it'll be the ruin of me <\s>
<s> it makes you say queer things said the captain looking altamont hard in the face <\s>
<s> remember what you said last night at clavering's table <\s>
<s> what did i say <\s>
<s> asked the other hastily <\s>
<s> did i split anything <\s>
<s> dammy strong did i split anything <\s>
<s> ask me no questions and i will tell you no lies the chevalier replied on his part <\s>
<s> strong thought of the words mr <\s>
<s> altamont had used and his abrupt departure from the baronet's dining table and house as soon as he recognised major pendennis or captain beak as he called the major <\s>
<s> but strong resolved to seek an explanation of these words otherwise than from colonel altamont and did not choose to recall them to the other's memory <\s>
<s> no he said then you didn't split as you call it colonel it was only a trap of mine to see if i could make you speak but you didn't say a word that anybody could comprehend you were too far gone for that <\s>
<s> so much the better altamont thought and heaved a great sigh as if relieved <\s>
<s> strong remarked the emotion but took no notice and the other being in a communicative mood went on speaking <\s>
<s> yes i own to my faults continued the colonel <\s>
<s> there is some things i can't do what i will resist a bottle of brandy a box of dice and a beautiful woman <\s>
<s> no man of pluck and spirit no man as was worth his salt ever could as i know of <\s>
<s> there's hardly p'raps a country in the world in which them three ain't got me into trouble <\s>
<s> yes from the age of fifteen when i ran away from home and went cabin boy on board an indiaman till now when i'm fifty year old pretty nigh them women have always been my ruin <\s>
<s> why it was one of em and with such black eyes and jewels on her neck and battens and ermine like a duchess i tell you it was one of em at paris that swept off the best part of the thousand pound as i went off with <\s>
<s> didn't i ever tell you of it <\s>
<s> well i don't mind <\s>
<s> at first i was very cautious and having such a lot of money kept it close and lived like a gentleman colonel altamont meurice's hotel and that sort of thing never played except at the public tables and won more than i lost <\s>
<s> well sir there was a chap that i saw at the hotel and the palace royal too a regular swell fellow with white kid gloves and a tuft to his chin bloundell bloundell his name was as i made acquaintance with somehow and he asked me to dinner and took me to madame the countess de foljambe's soirees such a woman strong such an eye <\s>
<s> such a hand at the pianner <\s>
<s> lor bless you she'd sit down and sing to you and gaze at you until she warbled your soul out of your body a'most <\s>
<s> she asked me to go to her evening parties every toosday and didn't i take opera boxes and give her dinners at the restauranteur's that's all <\s>
<s> but i had a run of luck at the tables and it was not in the dinners and opera boxes that poor clavering's money went <\s>
<s> no be hanged to it it was swept off in another way <\s>
<s> one night at the countess's there was several of us at supper mr <\s>
<s> bloundell bloundell the honourable deuceace the marky de la tour de force all tip top nobs sir and the height of fashion when we had supper and champagne you may be sure in plenty and then some of that confounded brandy <\s>
<s> i would have it i would it go on at it the countess mixed the tumblers of punch for me and we had cards as well as grog after supper and i played and drank until i don't know what i did <\s>
<s> i was like i was last night <\s>
<s> i was taken away and put to bed somehow and never woke until the next day to a roaring headache and to see my servant who said the honourable deuceace wanted to see me and was waiting in the sitting room <\s>
<s> how are you colonel <\s>
<s> says he a coming into my bedroom <\s>
<s> how long did you stay last night after i went away <\s>
<s> the play was getting too high for me and i'd lost enough to you for one night to me says i how's that my dear feller <\s>
<s> for though he was an earl's son we was as familiar as you and me <\s>
<s> how's that my dear feller <\s>
<s> says i and he tells me that he had borrowed thirty louis of me at vingt et un that he gave me an i o u <\s>
<s> for it the night before which i put into my pocket book before he left the room <\s>
<s> i takes out my card case it was the countess as worked it for me and there was the i o u <\s>
<s> sure enough and he paid me thirty louis in gold down upon the table at my bedside <\s>
<s> so i said he was a gentleman and asked him if he would like to take anything when my servant should get it for him but the honourable deuceace don't drink of a morning and he went away to some business which he said he had <\s>
<s> presently there's another ring at my outer door and this time it's bloundell bloundell and the marky that comes in <\s>
<s> bong jour marky says i <\s>
<s> so i said i had one and how i must have been uncommon queer the night afore but they both declared i didn't show no signs of having had too much but took my liquor as grave as a judge <\s>
<s> so says the marky deuceace has been with you we met him in the palais royal as we were coming from breakfast <\s>
<s> has he settled with you <\s>
<s> get it while you can he's a slippery card and as he won three ponies of bloundell i recommend you to get your money while he has some <\s>
<s> he has paid me says i but i knew no more than the dead that he owed me anything and don't remember a bit about lending him thirty louis <\s>
<s> the marky and bloundell looks and smiles at each other at this and bloundell says colonel you are a queer feller <\s>
<s> no man could have supposed from your manners that you had tasted anything stronger than tea all night and yet you forget things in the morning <\s>
<s> come come tell that to the marines my friend we won't have it at any price <\s>
<s> en efet says the marky twiddling his little black mustachios in the chimney glass and making a lunge or two as he used to do at the fencing school <\s>
<s> he was a wonder at the fencing school and i've seen him knock down the image fourteen times running at lepage's let us speak of affairs <\s>
<s> colonel you understand that affairs of honour are best settled at once perhaps it won't be inconvenient to you to arrange our little matters of last night <\s>
<s> do you owe me any money marky <\s>
<s> says he do not let us have any more jesting <\s>
<s> i have your note of hand for three hundred and forty louis <\s>
<s> says he taking out a paper from his pocket book <\s>
<s> and mine for two hundred and ten says bloundell bloundell and he pulls out his bit of paper <\s>
<s> i was in such a rage of wonder at this that i sprang out of bed and wrapped my dressing gown round me <\s>
<s> are you come here to make a fool of me <\s>
<s> i don't owe you two hundred or two thousand or two louis and i won't pay you a farthing <\s>
<s> do you suppose you can catch me with your notes of hand <\s>
<s> i laugh at em and at you and i believe you to be a couple <\s>
<s> a couple of what <\s>
<s> you of course are aware that we are a couple of men of honour colonel altamont and not come here to trifle or to listen to abuse from you <\s>
<s> you will either pay us or we will expose you as a cheat and chastise you as a cheat too says bloundell <\s>
<s> oui parbleu says the marky but i didn't mind him for i could have thrown the little fellow out of the window but it was different with bloundell he was a large man that weighs three stone more than me and stands six inches higher and i think he could have done for me <\s>
<s> monsieur will pay or monsieur will give me the reason why <\s>
<s> i believe you're little better than a polisson colonel altamont that was the phrase he used altamont said with a grin and i got plenty more of this language from the two fellows and was in the thick of the row with them when another of our party came in <\s>
<s> this was a friend of mine a gent i had met at boulogne and had taken to the countess's myself <\s>
<s> and as he hadn't played at all on the previous night and had actually warned me against bloundell and the others i told the story to him and so did the other two <\s>
<s> i am very sorry says he <\s>
<s> you would go on playing the countess entreated you to discontinue <\s>
<s> these gentlemen offered repeatedly to stop <\s>
<s> it was you that insisted on the large stakes not they <\s>
<s> in fact he charged dead against me and when the two others went away he told me how the marky would shoot me as sure as my name was was what it is <\s>
<s> i left the countess crying too said he <\s>
<s> she hates these two men she has warned you repeatedly against them which she actually had done and often told me never to play with them and now colonel i have left her in hysterics almost lest there should be any quarrel between you and that confounded marky should put a bullet through your head <\s>
<s> its my belief says my friend that that woman is distractedly in love with you <\s>
<s> do you think so <\s>
<s> says i upon which my friend told me how she had actually gone down on her knees to him and save colonel altamont <\s>
<s> as soon as i was dressed i went and called upon that lovely woman <\s>
<s> she gave a shriek and pretty near fainted when she saw me <\s>
<s> she called me ferdinand i'm blest if she didn't <\s>
<s> i thought your name was jack said strong with a laugh at which the colonel blushed very much behind his dyed whiskers <\s>
<s> a man may have more names than one mayn't he strong <\s>
<s> when i'm with a lady i like to take a good one <\s>
<s> she called me by my christian name <\s>
<s> she cried fit to break your heart <\s>
<s> i can't stand seeing a woman cry never could not whilst i'm fond of her <\s>
<s> she said she could bear not to think of my losing so much money in her house <\s>
<s> wouldn't i take her diamonds and necklaces and pay part <\s>
<s> i swore i wouldn't touch a farthing's worth of her jewellery which perhaps i did not think was worth a great deal but what can a woman do more than give you her all <\s>
<s> that's the sort i like and i know there's plenty of em <\s>
<s> and i told her to be easy about the money for i would not pay one single farthing <\s>
<s> then they'll shoot you says she they'll kill my ferdinand they'll kill my jack wouldn't have sounded well in french strong said laughing <\s>
<s> never mind about names said the other sulkily a man of honour may take any name he chooses i suppose <\s>
<s> well go on with your story said strong <\s>
<s> she said they would kill you <\s>
<s> no says i they won't for i will not let that scamp of a marquis send me out of the world and if he lays a hand on me i'll brain him marquis as he is <\s>
<s> at this the countess shrank back from me as if i had said something very shocking <\s>
<s> do i understand colonel altamont aright <\s>
<s> says she and that a british officer refuses to meet any person who provokes him to the field of honour <\s>
<s> field of honour be hanged countess says i <\s>
<s> you would not have me be a target for that little scoundrel's pistol practice <\s>
<s> colonel altamont says the countess i thought you were a man of honour i thought i but no matter <\s>
<s> good bye sir and she was sweeping out of the room her voice regular choking in her pocket handkerchief <\s>
<s> says i rushing after her and seizing her hand <\s>
<s> leave me monsieur le colonel says she shaking me off my father was a general of the grand army <\s>
<s> a soldier should know how to pay all his debts of honour <\s>
<s> what could i do <\s>
<s> everybody was against me <\s>
<s> caroline said i had lost the money though i didn't remember a syllable about the business <\s>
<s> i had taken deuceace's money too but then it was because he offered it to me you know and that's a different thing <\s>
<s> every one of these chaps was a man of fashion and honour and the marky and the countess of the first families in france <\s>
<s> and by jove sir rather than offend her i paid the money up five hundred and sixty gold napoleons by jove besides three hundred which i lost when i had my revenge <\s>
<s> and i can't tell you at this minute whether i was done or not concluded the colonel musing <\s>
<s> sometimes i think i was but then caroline was so fond of me <\s>
<s> that woman would never have seen me done never i'm sure she wouldn't at least if she would i'm deceived in woman <\s>
<s> any further revelations of his past life which altamont might have been disposed to confide to his honest comrade the chevalier were interrupted by a knocking at the outer door of their chambers which when opened by grady the servant admitted no less a person than sir francis clavering into the presence of the two worthies <\s>
<s> the governor by jove cried strong regarding the arrival of his patron with surprise <\s>
<s> what's brought you here <\s>
<s> growled altamont looking sternly from under his heavy eyebrows at the baronet <\s>
<s> it's no good i warrant <\s>
<s> and indeed good very seldom brought sir francis clavering into that or any other place <\s>
<s> whenever he came into shepherd's inn it was money that brought the unlucky baronet into those precincts and there was commonly a gentleman of the money dealing world in waiting for him at strong's chambers or at campion's below and a question of bills to negotiate or to renew <\s>
<s> claverng was a man who had never looked his debts fairly in the face familiar as he had been with them all his life as long as he could renew a bill his mind was easy regarding it and he would sign almost anything for to morrow provided to day could be left unmolested <\s>
<s> he was a man whom scarcely any amount of fortune could have benefited permanently and who was made to be ruined to cheat small tradesmen to be the victim of astuter sharpers to be niggardly and reckless and as destitute of honesty as the people who cheated him and a dupe chiefly because he was too mean to be a successful knave <\s>
<s> he had told more lies in his time and undergone more baseness of stratagem in order to stave off a small debt or to swindle a poor creditor than would have sufficed to make a fortune for a braver rogue <\s>
<s> he was abject and a shuffler in the very height of his prosperity <\s>
<s> had he been a crown prince he could not have been more weak useless dissolute or ungrateful <\s>
<s> he could not move through life except leaning on the arm of somebody and yet he never had an agent but he mistrusted him and marred any plans which might be arranged for his benefit and secretly acting against the people whom he employed <\s>
<s> strong knew clavering and judged him quite correctly <\s>
<s> it was not as friends that this pair met but the chevalier worked for his principal as he would when in the army have pursued a harassing march or undergone his part in the danger and privations of a siege because it was his duty and because he had agreed to it <\s>
<s> what is it he wants <\s>
<s> thought the officers of the shepherd's inn garrison when the baronet came among them <\s>
<s> his pale face expressed extreme anger and irritation <\s>
<s> so sir he said addressing altamont you've been at your old tricks <\s>
<s> asked altamont with a sneer <\s>
<s> you have been at the rouge et noir you were there last night cried the baronet <\s>
<s> how do you know were you there <\s>
<s> i was at the club but it wasn't on the colours i played ask the captain i've been telling him of it <\s>
<s> it was with the bones <\s>
<s> it was at hazard sir francis upon my word and honour it was and he looked at the baronet with a knowing humorous mock humility which only seemed to make the other more angry <\s>
<s> what the deuce do i care sir how a man like you loses his money and whether it is at hazard or roulette <\s>
<s> screamed the baronet with a multiplicity of oaths and at the top of his voice <\s>
<s> what i will not have sir is that you should use my name or couple it with yours damn him strong why don't you keep him in better order <\s>
<s> i tell you he has gone and used my name again sir drawn a bill upon me and lost the money on the table i can't stand it i won't stand it <\s>
<s> flesh and blood won't bear it do you know how much i have paid for you sir <\s>
<s> this was only a very little un sir francis only fifteen pound captain strong they wouldn't stand another and it oughtn't to anger you governor <\s>
<s> why it's so trifling i did not even mention it to strong did i now captain <\s>
<s> i protest it had quite slipped my memory and all on account of that confounded liquor i took <\s>
<s> liquor or no liquor sir it is no business of mine <\s>
<s> i don't care what you drink or where you drink it only it shan't be in my house <\s>
<s> and i will not have you breaking into my house of a night and a fellow like you intruding himself on my company how dared you show yourself in grosvenor place last night sir and and what do you suppose my friends must think of me when they see a man of your sort walking into my dining room uninvited and drunk and calling for liquor as if you were the master of the house <\s>
<s> they'll think you know some very queer sort of people i dare say altamont said with impenetrable good humour <\s>
<s> look here baronet i apologise on my honour i do and ain't an apology enough between two gentlemen <\s>
<s> it was a strong measure i own walking into your cuddy and calling for drink as if i was the captain but i had had too much before you see that's why i wanted some more nothing can be more simple and it was because they wouldn't give me no more money upon your name at the black and red that i thought i would come down and speak to you about it <\s>
<s> to refuse me was nothing but to refuse a bill drawn on you that have been such a friend to the shop and are a baronet and a member of parliament and a gentleman and no mistake damme its ungrateful <\s>
<s> by heavens if ever you do it again if ever you dare show to yourself in my house or give my name at a gambling house or at any other house by jove at any other house or give any reference at all to me or speak to me in the street by god or anywhere else until i speak to you i disclaim you altogether i won't give you another shilling <\s>
<s> governor don't be provoking altamont said surlily <\s>
<s> don't talk to me about daring to do this thing or t'other or when my dander is up it's the very thing to urge me on <\s>
<s> i oughtn't to have come last night i know i oughtn't but i told you i was drunk and that ought to be sufficient between gentleman and gentleman <\s>
<s> dammy sir said the baronet how dares a fellow like you to call himself a gentleman <\s>
<s> i ain't a baronet i know growled the other and i've forgotten how to be a gentleman almost now but but i was one once and my father was one and i'll not have this sort of talk from you sir f <\s>
<s> i want to go abroad again <\s>
<s> why don't you come down with the money and let me go <\s>
<s> why the devil are you to be rolling in riches and me to have none <\s>
<s> why should have a house and a table covered with plate and me be in a garret here in this beggarly shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> we're partners ain't we <\s>
<s> i'd as good a right to be rich as you have haven't i <\s>
<s> tell the story to strong here if you like and ask him to be umpire between us <\s>
<s> i don't mind letting my secret out to a man that won't split <\s>
<s> look here strong perhaps you guess the story already the fact is me and the governor d hold your tongue shrieked out the baronet in a fury <\s>
<s> you shall have the money as soon as i can get it <\s>
<s> i ain't made of money <\s>
<s> i'm so pressed and badgered i don't know where to turn <\s>
<s> i shall go mad by jove i shall <\s>
<s> i wish i was dead for i'm the most miserable brute alive <\s>
<s> altamont don't mind me <\s>
<s> when i'm out of health and i'm devilish bilious this morning hang me i abuse everybody and don't know what i say <\s>

<s> i i'll try and get that little business done <\s>
<s> upon my word he shall <\s>
<s> and i say strong my boy i want to speak to you <\s>
<s> come into the office for a minute <\s>
<s> almost all clavering's assaults ended in this ignominious way and in a shameful retreat <\s>
<s> altamont sneered after the baronet as he left the room and entered into the office to talk privately with his factotum <\s>
<s> what is the matter now <\s>
<s> the latter asked of him <\s>
<s> it's the old story i suppose <\s>
<s> d it yes the baronet said <\s>
<s> i dropped two hundred in ready money at the little coventry last night and gave a cheque for three hundred more <\s>
<s> on her ladyship's bankers too for to morrow and i must meet it for there'll be the deuce to pay else <\s>
<s> the last time she paid my play debts i swore i would not touch a dice box again and she'll keep her word strong and dissolve partnership if i go on <\s>
<s> i wish i had three hundred a year and was away <\s>
<s> at a german watering place you can do devilish well with three hundred a year <\s>
<s> but my habits are so d   reckless i wish i was in the serpentine <\s>
<s> i wish i was dead by gad i wish i was <\s>
<s> i wish i had never touched those confounded bones <\s>
<s> i had such a run of luck last night with five for the main and seven to five all night until those ruffians wanted to pay me with altamont's bill upon me <\s>
<s> the luck turned from that minute <\s>
<s> never held the box again for three mains and came away cleared out leaving that infernal cheque behind me <\s>
<s> how shall i pay it <\s>
<s> blackland won't hold it over <\s>
<s> hulker and bullock will write about it directly to her ladyship <\s>
<s> by jove ned i'm the most miserable brute in all england <\s>
<s> it was necessary for ned to devise some plan to console the baronet under this pressure of grief and no doubt he found the means of procuring a loan for his patron for he was closeted at mr <\s>
<s> campion's offices that day for some time <\s>
<s> altamont had once more a guinea or two in his pocket with a promise of a further settlement and the baronet had no need to wish himself dead for the next two or three months at least <\s>
<s> and strong putting together what he had learned from the colonel and sir francis began to form in his own mind a pretty accurate opinion as to the nature of the tie which bound the two men together <\s>
<s> a chapter of conversations every day after the entertainment at grosvenor place and greenwich of which we have seen major pendennis partake the worthy gentleman's friendship and cordiality for the clavering family seemed to increase <\s>
<s> his calls were frequent his attentions to the lady of the house unremitting <\s>
<s> an old man about town he had the good fortune to be received in many houses at which a lady of lady clavering's distinction ought to be seen <\s>
<s> would her ladyship not like to be present at the grand entertainment at gaunt house <\s>
<s> there was to be a very pretty breakfast ball at viscount marrowfat's at fulham <\s>
<s> everybody was to be there including august personages of the highest rank and there was to be a watteau quadrille in which miss amory would surely look charming <\s>
<s> to these and other amusements the obsequious old gentleman kindly offered to conduct lady clavering and was also ready to make himself useful to the baronet in any way agreeable to the latter <\s>
<s> in spite of his present station and fortune the world persisted in looking rather coldly upon clavering and strange suspicious rumours followed him about <\s>
<s> he was blackballed at two clubs in succession <\s>
<s> in the house of commons he only conversed with a few of the most disreputable members of that famous body having a happy knack of choosing bad society and adapting himself naturally to it as other people do to the company of their betters <\s>
<s> the name all the senators with whom clavering consorted would be invidious <\s>
<s> we may mention only a few <\s>
<s> there was captain raff the honourable member for epsom who retired after the last goodwood races having accepted as mr <\s>
<s> hotspur the whip of the party said a mission to the levant there was hustingson the patriotic member for islington whose voice is never heard now denunciating corruption since his appointment to the governorship of coventry island there was bob freeny of the booterstown freenys who is a dead shot and of whom we therefore wish to speak with every respect and of all these gentlemen with whom in the course of his professional duty mr <\s>
<s> hotspur had to confer there was none for whom he had a more thorough contempt and dislike than for sir francis clavering the representative of an ancient race who had sat for their own borough of clavering time out of mind in the house <\s>
<s> if that man is wanted for a division hotspur said ten to one he is to be found in a hell <\s>
<s> he was educated in the fleet and he has not heard the end of newgate yet take my word for it <\s>
<s> he'll muddle away the begum's fortune at thimble rig be caught picking pockets and finish on board the hulks <\s>
<s> and if the high born hotspur with such an opinion of clavering could yet from professional reasons be civil to him why should not major pendennis also have reasons of his own for being attentive to this unlucky gentleman <\s>
<s> he has a very good cellar and a very good cook the major said as long as he is silent he is not offensive and he very seldom speaks <\s>
<s> if he chooses to frequent gambling tables and lose his money to blacklegs what matters to me <\s>
<s> don't look too curiously into any man's affairs pen my boy every fellow has some cupboard in his house begad which he would not like you and me to peep into <\s>
<s> why should we try when the rest of the house is open to us <\s>
<s> and a devilish good house too as you and i know <\s>
<s> and if the man of the family is not all one could wish the women are excellent <\s>
<s> the begum is not over refined but as kind a woman as ever lived and devilish clever too and as for the little blanche you know my opinion about her you rogue you know my belief is that she is sweet on you and would have you for the asking <\s>
<s> but you are growing such a great man that i suppose you won't be content under a duke's daughter hey sir <\s>
<s> i recommend you to ask one of them and try <\s>
<s> perhaps pen was somewhat intoxicated by his success in the world and it may also have entered into the young man's mind his uncle's perpetual hints serving not a little to encourage the notion that miss amory was tolerably well disposed to renew the little flirtation which had been carried on in the early days of both of them by the banks of the rural brawl <\s>
<s> but he was little disposed to marriage he said at that moment and adopting some of his uncle's worldly tone spoke rather contemptuously of the institution and in favour of a bachelor life <\s>
<s> you are very happy sir said he and you get on very well alone and so do i <\s>
<s> with a wife at my side i should lose my place in society and i don't for my part much fancy retiring into the country with a mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis or taking my wife into lodgings to be waited upon by the servant of all work <\s>
<s> the period of my little illusions is over <\s>
<s> you cured me of my first love who certainly was a fool and would have had a fool for her husband and a very sulky discontented husband too if she had taken me <\s>
<s> we young fellows live fast sir and i feel as old at five and twenty as many of the old fo the old bachelors whom i see in the bow window at bays's <\s>
<s> don't look offended i only mean that i am blase about love matters and that i could no more fan myself into a flame for miss amory now than i could adore lady mirabel over again <\s>
<s> i wish i could i rather like old mirabel for his infatuation about her and think his passion is the most respectable part of his life <\s>
<s> sir charles mirabel was always a theatrical man sir the major said annoyed that his nephew should speak flippantly of any person of sir charles's rank and station <\s>
<s> he has been occupied with theatricals since his early days <\s>
<s> he acted at carlton house when he was page to the prince he has been mixed up with that sort of thing he could afford to marry whom he chooses and lady mirabel is a most respectable woman received everywhere everywhere mind <\s>
<s> the duchess of connaught receives her lady rockminster receives her it doesn't become young fellows to speak lightly of people in that station <\s>
<s> there's not a more respectable woman in england than lady mirabel and the old fogies as you call them at bays's are some of the first gentlemen in england of whom you youngsters had best learn a little manners and a little breeding and a little modesty <\s>
<s> and the major began to think that pen was growing exceedingly pert and conceited and that the world made a great deal too much of him <\s>
<s> the major's anger amused pen <\s>
<s> he studied his uncle's peculiarities with a constant relish and was always in a good humour with his worldly old mentor <\s>
<s> i am a youngster of fifteen years standing sir he said adroitly and if you think that we are disrespectful you should see those of the present generation <\s>
<s> a protege of yours came to breakfast with me the other day <\s>
<s> you told me to ask him and i did it to please you <\s>
<s> we had a day's sights together and dined at the club and went to the play <\s>
<s> he said the wine at the polyanthus was not so good as ellis's wine at richmond smoked warrington's cavendish after breakfast and when i gave him a sovereign as a farewell token said he had plenty of them but would take it to show he wasn't proud <\s>
<s> did he did you ask young clavering <\s>
<s> cried the major appeased at once fine boy rather wild but a fine boy parents like that sort of attention and you can't do better than pay it to our worthy friends of grosvenor place <\s>
<s> and so you took him to the play and tipped him <\s>
<s> that was right sir that was right with which mentor quitted telemachus thinking that the young men were not so very bad and that he should make something of that fellow yet <\s>
<s> as blaster clavering grew into years and stature he became too strong for the authority of his fond parents and governess and rather governed them than permitted himself to be led by their orders <\s>
<s> with his papa he was silent and sulky seldom making his appearance however in the neighbourhood of that gentleman with his mamma be roared and fought when any contest between them arose as to the gratification of his appetite or other wish of his heart and in his disputes with his governess over his book he kicked that quiet creature's shins so fiercely that she was entirely overmastered and subdued by him <\s>
<s> and he would have so treated his sister blanche too and did on one or two occasions attempt to prevail over her but she showed an immense resolution and spirit on her part and boxed his ears so soundly that he forbore from molesting miss amory as he did the governess and his mamma and his mamma's maid <\s>
<s> at length when the family came to london sir francis gave forth his opinion that the little beggar had best be sent to school <\s>
<s> accordingly the young son and heir of the house of clavering was despatched to the rev <\s>
<s> otto rose's establishment at twickenham where young noblemen and gentlemen were received preparatory to their introduction to the great english public schools <\s>
<s> it is not our intention to follow master clavering in his scholastic career the paths to the temple of learning were made more easy to him than they were to some of us of earlier generations <\s>
<s> he advanced towards that fane in a carriage and four so to speak and might halt and take refreshment almost whenever he pleased <\s>
<s> he wore varnished boots from the earliest period of youth and had cambric handkerchiefs and lemon coloured kid gloves of the smallest size ever manufactured by privat <\s>
<s> they dressed regularly at mr <\s>
<s> rose's to come down to dinner the young gentlemen had shawl dressing gowns fires in their bedrooms horse and carriage exercise occasionally and oil for their hair <\s>
<s> corporal punishment was altogether dispensed with by the principal who thought that moral discipline was entirely sufficient to lead youth and the boys were so rapidly advanced in many branches of learning that they acquired the art of drinking spirits and smoking cigars even before they were old enough to enter a public school <\s>
<s> young frank clavering stole his father's havannahs and conveyed them to school or smoked them in the stables at a surprisingly early period of life and at ten years old drank his champagne almost as stoutly as any whiskered cornet of dragoons could do <\s>
<s> when this interesting youth came home for his vacations major pendennis was as laboriously civil and gracious to him as he was to the rest of the family although the boy had rather a contempt for old wigsby as the major was denominated mimicked him behind his back as the polite major bowed and smirked with lady clavering or miss amory and drew rude caricatures such as are designed by ingenious youths in which the major's wig his nose his tie etc were represented with artless exaggeration <\s>
<s> untiring in his efforts to be agreeable the major wished that pen too should take particular notice of this child incited arthur to invite him to his chambers to give him a dinner at the club to take him to madame tussaud's the tower the play and so forth and to tip him as the phrase is at the end of the day's pleastres <\s>
<s> arthur who was good natured and fond of children went through all these ceremonies one day had the boy to breakfast at the temple where he made the most contemptuous remarks regarding the furniture the crockery and the tattered state of warrington's dressing gown and smoked a short pipe and recounted the history of a fight between tuffy and long biggings at rose's greatly to the edification of the two gentlemen his hosts <\s>
<s> as the major rightly predicted lady clavering was very grateful for arthur's attention to the boy more grateful than the lad himself who took attentions as a matter of course and very likely had more sovereigns in his pocket than poor pen who generously gave him one of his own slender stock of those coins <\s>
<s> the major with the sharp eyes with which nature endowed him and with the glasses of age and experience watched this boy and surveyed his position in the family without seeming to be rudely curious about their affairs <\s>
<s> but as a country neighbour one who had many family obligations to the claverings an old man of the world he took occasion to find out what lady clavering's means were how her capital was disposed and what the boy was to inherit <\s>
<s> and setting himself to work for what purposes will appear no doubt ulteriorly he soon had got a pretty accurate knowledge of lady clavering's affairs and fortune and of the prospects of her daughter and son <\s>
<s> the daughter was to have but a slender provision the bulk of the property was as before has been said to go to the son his father did not care for him or anybody else his mother was dotingly fond of him as the child of her latter days his sister disliked him <\s>
<s> such may be stated in round numbers to be the result of the information which major pendennis got <\s>
<s> my dear madam he would say patting the head of the boy this boy may wear a baron's coronet on his head on some future coronation if matters are but managed rightly and if sir francis clavering would but play his cards well <\s>
<s> at this the widow amory heaved a deep sigh <\s>
<s> he plays only much of his cards major i'm afraid she said <\s>
<s> the major owned that he knew as much did not disguise that he had heard of sir francis clavering's unfortunate propensity to play pitied lady clavering sincerely but spoke with such genuine sentiment and sense that her ladyship glad to find a person of experience to whom she could confide her grief and her condition talked about them pretty unreservedly to major pendennis and was eager to have his advice and consolation <\s>
<s> major pendennis became the begum's confidante and house friend and as a mother a wife and a capitalist she consulted him <\s>
<s> he gave her to understand showing at the same time a great deal of respectful sympathy that he was acquainted with some of the circumstances of her first unfortunate marriage and with even the person of her late husband whom he remembered in calcutta when she was living in seclusion with her father <\s>
<s> the poor lady with tears of shame more than of grief in her eyes told her version of her story <\s>
<s> going back a child to india after two years at a european school she had met amory and foolishly married him <\s>
<s> oh you don't know how miserable that man made me she said or what a life i passed betwixt him and my father <\s>
<s> before i saw him i had never seen a man except my father's clerks and native servants <\s>
<s> you know we didn't go into society in india on account of i know said major pendennis with a bow i was a wild romantic child my head was full of novels which i'd read at school i listened to his wild stories and adventures for he was a daring fellow and i thought he talked beautifully of those calm nights on the passage out when he used to <\s>
<s> well i married him and i was wretched from that day wretched with my father whose character you know major pendennis and i won't speak of but he wasn't a good man sir neither to my poor mother nor to me except that he left me his money nor to no one else that i ever heard of and he didn't do many kind actions in his lifetime i'm afraid <\s>
<s> and as for amory he was almost worse he was a spendthrift when my father was close he drank dreadfully and was furious when in that way <\s>
<s> he wasn't in any way a good or a faithful husband to me major pendennis and if he'd died in the gaol before this trial instead of afterwards he would have saved me a deal of shame and of unhappiness since sir <\s>
<s> lady clavering added for perhaps i should not have married at all if i had not been so anxious to change his horrid name and i have not been happy in my second husband as i suppose you know sir <\s>
<s> ah major pendennis i've got money to be sure and i'm a lady and people fancy i'm very happy but i ain't <\s>
<s> we all have our cares and griefs and troubles and many's the day that i sit down to one of my grand dinners with an aching heart and many a night do i lay awake on my fine bed a great deal more unhappy than the maid that makes for it <\s>
<s> i'm not a happy woman major for all the world says and envies the begum her diamonds and carriages and the great company that comes to my house <\s>
<s> i'm not happy in my husband i'm not in my daughter <\s>
<s> she ain't a good girl like that dear laura bell at fairoaks <\s>
<s> she's cost me many a tear though you don't see em and she sneers at her mother because i haven't had learning and that <\s>
<s> i was brought up amongst natives till i was twelve and went back to india when i was fourteen <\s>
<s> ah major i should have been a good woman if i had had a good husband <\s>
<s> and now i must go upstairs and wipe my eyes for they're red with cryin <\s>
<s> and lady rockminster's a comin and we're goin to ave a drive in the park <\s>
<s> and when lady rockminster made her appearance there was not a trace of tears or vexation on lady clavering's face but she was full of spirits and bounced out with her blunders and talk and murdered the king's english with the utmost liveliness and good humour <\s>
<s> begad she is not such a bad woman <\s>
<s> the major thought within himself <\s>
<s> she is not refined certainly and calls apollo apoller but she has some heart and i like that sort of thing and a devilish deal of money too <\s>
<s> three stars in india stock to her name begad <\s>
<s> which that young cub is to have is he <\s>
<s> and he thought how he should like to see a little of the money transferred to miss blanche and better still one of those stars shining in the name of mr <\s>
<s> still bent upon pursuing his schemes whatsoever they might be the old negotiator took the privilege of his intimacy and age to talk in a kindly and fatherly manner to miss blanche when he found occasion to see her alone <\s>
<s> he came in so frequently at luncheon time and became so familiar with the ladies that they did not even hesitate to quarrel before him and lady clavering whose tongue was loud and temper brusque had many a battle with the sylphide in the family friend's presence <\s>
<s> blanche's wit seldom failed to have the mastery in these encounters and the keen barbs of her arrows drove her adversary discomfited away <\s>
<s> i am an old fellow the major said i have nothing to do in life <\s>
<s> i have my eyes open <\s>
<s> i keep good counsel <\s>
<s> i am the friend of both of you and if you choose to quarrel before me why i shan't tell any one <\s>
<s> but you are two good people and i intend to make it up between you <\s>
<s> i have between lots of people husbands and wives fathers and sons daughters and mammas before this <\s>
<s> i like it i've nothing else to do <\s>
<s> one day then the old diplomatist entered lady clavering's drawing room just as the latter quitted it evidently in a high state of indignation and ran past him up the stairs to her own apartments <\s>
<s> she couldn't speak to him now she said she was a great deal too angry with that that that little wicked anger choked the rest of the words or prevented their utterance until lady clavering had passed out of hearing <\s>
<s> my dear good miss amory the major said entering the drawing room i see what is happening <\s>
<s> you and mamma have been disagreeing <\s>
<s> mothers and daughters disagree in the best families <\s>
<s> it was but last week that i healed up a quarrel between lady clapperton and her daughter lady claudia <\s>
<s> lady lear and her eldest daughter have not spoken for fourteen years <\s>
<s> kinder and more worthy people than these i never knew in the whole course of my life for everybody but each other admirable <\s>
<s> but they can't live together they oughtn't to live together and i wish my dear creature with all my soul that i could see you with an establishment of your own for there is no woman in london who could conduct one better with your own establishment making your own home happy <\s>
<s> i am not very happy in this one said the sylphide and the stupidity of mamma is enough to provoke a saint <\s>
<s> precisely so you are not suited to one another <\s>
<s> your mother committed one fault in early life or was it nature my dear in your case she ought not to have educated you <\s>
<s> you ought not to have been bred up to become the refined and intellectual being you are surrounded as i own you are by those who have not your genius or your refinement <\s>
<s> your place would be to lead in the most brilliant circles not to follow and take a second place in any society <\s>
<s> i have watched you miss amory you are ambitious and your proper sphere is command <\s>
<s> you ought to shine and you never can in this house i know it <\s>
<s> i hope i shall see you in another and a happier one some day and the mistress of it <\s>
<s> the sylphide shrugged her lily shoulders with a look of scorn <\s>
<s> where is the prince and where is the palace major pendennis <\s>
<s> but there is no romance in the world now no real affection <\s>
<s> no indeed said the major with the most sentimental and simple air which he could muster <\s>
<s> not that i know anything about it said blanche casting her eyes down except what i have read in novels <\s>
<s> of course not major pendennis cried how should you my dear young lady <\s>
<s> and novels ain't true as you remark admirably and there is no romance left in the world <\s>
<s> begad i wish i was a young fellow like my nephew <\s>
<s> and what continued miss amory musing what are the men whom we see about at the balls every night dancing guardsmen penniless treasury clerks boobies <\s>
<s> if i had my brother's fortune i might have such an establishment as you promise me but with my name and with my little means what am i to look to <\s>
<s> a country parson or a barrister in a street near russell square or a captain in a dragoon regiment who will take lodgings for me and come home from the mess tipsy and smelling of smoke like sir francis clavering <\s>
<s> that is how we girls are destined to end life <\s>
<s> o major pendennis i am sick of london and of balls and of young dandies with their chin tips and of the insolent great ladies who know us one day and cut us the next and of the world altogether <\s>
<s> i should like to leave it and to go into a convent that i should <\s>
<s> i shall never find anybody to understand me <\s>
<s> and i live here as much alone in my family and in the world as if i were in a cell locked up for ever <\s>
<s> i wish there were sisters of charity here and that i could be one and catch the plague and die of it i wish to quit the world <\s>
<s> i am not very old but i am tired i have suffered so much i've been so disillusionated i'm weary i'm weary o that the angel of death would come and beckon me away <\s>
<s> this speech may be interpreted as follows <\s>
<s> a few nights since a great lady lady flamingo had cut miss amory and lady clavering <\s>
<s> she was quite mad because she could not get an invitation to lady drum's ball it was the end of the season and nobody had proposed to her she had made no sensation at all she who was so much cleverer than any girl of the year and of the young ladies forming her special circle <\s>
<s> dora who had but five thousand pounds flora who had nothing and leonora who had red hair were going to be married and nobody had come for blanche amory <\s>
<s> you judge wisely about the world and about your position my dear miss blanche the major said <\s>
<s> the prince don't marry nowadays as you say unless the princess has a doosid deal of money in the funds or is a lady of his own rank the young folks of the great families marry into the great families if they haven't fortune they have each other's shoulders to push on in the world which is pretty nearly as good a girl with your fortune can scarcely hope for a great match but a girl with your genius and your admirable tact and fine manners with a clever husband by her side may make any place for herself in the world we are grown doosid republican <\s>
<s> talent ranks with birth and wealth now begad and a clever man with a clever wife may take any place they please <\s>
<s> miss amory did not of course in the least understand what major pendennis meant perhaps she thought over circumstances in her mind and asked herself could he be a negotiator for a former suitor of hers and could he mean pen <\s>
<s> no it was impossible he had been civil but nothing more so she said laughing who is the clever man and when will you bring him to me major pendennis <\s>
<s> i am dying to see him <\s>
<s> at this moment a servant threw open the door and announced mr <\s>
<s> henry foker at which name and at the appearance of our friend both the lady and the gentleman burst out laughing <\s>
<s> that is not the man major pendennis said <\s>
<s> he is engaged to his cousin lord gravesend's daughter good bye my dear miss amory <\s>
<s> was pen growing worldly and should a man not get the experience of the world and lay it to his account <\s>
<s> he felt for his part as he said that he was growing very old very soon <\s>
<s> how this town forms and changes us he said once to warrington <\s>
<s> each had come in from his night's amusement and pen was smoking his pipe and recounting as his habit was to his friend the observations and adventures of the evening just past <\s>
<s> how i am changed he said from the simpleton boy at fairoaks who was fit to break his heart about his first love <\s>
<s> lady mirabel had a reception to night and was as grave and collected as if she had been born a duchess and had never seen a trap door in her life <\s>
<s> she gave me the honour of a conversation and patronised me about walter lorraine quite kindly <\s>
<s> pen said simply at which the other burst out laughing according to his wont <\s>
<s> is it possible he said that anybody should think of patronising the eminent author of walter lorraine you laugh at both of us pen said blushing a little i was coming to that myself <\s>
<s> she told me that she had not read the book as indeed i believe she never read a book in her life but that lady rockminster had and that the duchess of connaught pronounced it to be very clever <\s>
<s> in that case i said i should die happy for that to please those two ladies was in fact the great aim of my existence and having their approbation of course i need look for no other <\s>
<s> lady mirabel looked at me solemnly out of her fine eyes and said oh indeed as if she understood me and then she asked me whether i went to the duchess's thursdays and when i said no hoped she should see me there and that i must try and get there everybody went there everybody who was in society and then we talked of the new ambassador from timbuctoo and how he was better than the old one and how lady mary billington was going to marry a clergyman quite below her in rank and how lord and lady ringdove had fallen out three months after their marriage about tom pouter of the blues lady ringdove's cousin and so forth <\s>
<s> from the gravity of that woman you would have fancied she had been born in a palace and lived all the seasons of her life in belgrave square <\s>
<s> and you i suppose you took your part in the conversation pretty well as the descendant of the earl your father and the heir of fairoaks castle <\s>
<s> yes i remember reading of the festivities which occurred when you came of age <\s>
<s> the countess gave a brilliant tea soiree to the neighbouring nobility and the tenantry were regaled in the kitchen with a leg of mutton and a quart of ale <\s>
<s> the remains of the banquet were distributed amongst the poor of the village and the entrance to the park was illuminated until old john put the candle out on retiring to rest at his usual hour <\s>
<s> my mother is not a countess said pen though she has very good blood in her veins too but commoner as she is i have never met a peeress who was more than her peer mr <\s>
<s> george and if you will come to fairoaks castle you shall judge for yourself of her and of my cousin too <\s>
<s> they are not so witty as the london women but they certainly are as well bred <\s>
<s> the thoughts of women in the country are turned to other objects than those which occupy your london ladies <\s>
<s> in the country a woman has her household and her poor her long calm days and long calm evenings <\s>
<s> devilish long warrington said and a great deal too calm i've tried em <\s>
<s> the monotony of that existence must be to a certain degree melancholy like the tune of a long ballad and its harmony grave and gentle sad and tender it would be unendurable else <\s>
<s> the loneliness of women in the country makes them of necessity soft and sentimental <\s>
<s> leading a life of calm duty constant routine mystic reverie a sort of nuns at large too much gaiety or laughter would jar upon their almost sacred quiet and would be as out of place there as in a church <\s>
<s> where you go to sleep over the sermon warrington said <\s>
<s> you are a professed misogynist and hate the sex because i suspect you know very little about them mr <\s>
<s> pen continued with an air of considerable self complacency <\s>
<s> if you dislike the women in the country for being too slow surely the london woman ought to be fast enough for you <\s>
<s> the pace of london life is enormous how do people last at it i wonder male and female <\s>
<s> take a woman of the world follow her course through the season one asks how she can survive it <\s>
<s> or if she tumbles into a sleep at the end of august and lies torpid until the spring <\s>
<s> she goes into the world every night and sits watching her marriageable daughters dancing till long after dawn <\s>
<s> she has a nursery of little ones very likely at home to whom she administers example and affection having an eye likewise to bread and milk catechism music and french and roast leg of mutton at one o'clock she has to call upon ladies of her own station either domestically or in her public character in which she sits upon charity committees or ball committees or emigration committees or queen's college committees and discharges i don't know what more duties of british stateswomanship <\s>
<s> she very likely keeps a poor visiting list has conversations with the clergyman about soup or flannel or proper religious teaching for the parish and if she lives in certain districts probably attends early church <\s>
<s> she has the newspapers to read and at least must know what her husband's party is about so as to be able to talk to her neighbour at dinner and it is a fact that she reads every new book that comes out for she can talk and very smartly and well about them all and you see them all upon her drawing room table <\s>
<s> she has the cares of her household besides to make both ends meet to make the girls milliner's bills appear not too dreadful to the father and paymaster of the family to snip off in secret a little extra article of expenditure here and there and convey it in the shape of a bank note to the boys at college or at sea to check the encroachments of tradesmen and housekeepers financial fallacies to keep upper and lower servants from jangling with one another and the household in order <\s>
<s> add to this that she has a secret taste for some art or science models in clay makes experiments in chemistry or plays in private on the violoncello and i say without exaggeration many london ladies are doing this and you have a character before you such as our ancestors never heard of and such as belongs entirely to our era and period of civilisation <\s>
<s> how rapidly we live and grow <\s>
<s> in nine months mr <\s>
<s> paxton grows you a pineapple as large as a portmanteau whereas a little one no bigger than a dutch cheese took three years to attain his majority in old times and as the race of pineapples so is the race of man <\s>
<s> hoiaper what's the greek for a pineapple warrington <\s>
<s> stop for mercy's sake stop with the english and before you come to the greek warrington cried out laughing <\s>
<s> i never heard you make such a long speech or was aware that you had penetrated so deeply into the female mysteries <\s>
<s> who taught you all this and into whose boudoirs and nurseries have you been peeping whilst i was smoking my pipe and reading my book lying on my straw bed <\s>
<s> you are on the bank old boy content to watch the waves tossing in the winds and the struggles of others at sea pen said <\s>
<s> i am in the stream now and by jove i like it <\s>
<s> how rapidly we go down it hey <\s>
<s> strong and feeble old and young the metal pitchers and the earthen pitchers the pretty little china boat swims gaily till the big bruised brazen one bumps him and sends him down eh vogue la galere you see a man sink in the race and say good bye to him look he has only dived under the other fellow's legs and comes up shaking his pole and striking out ever so far ahead <\s>
<s> eh vogue la galere i say <\s>
<s> it's good sport warrington not winning merely but playing <\s>
<s> well go in and win young un <\s>
<s> i'll sit and mark the game warrington said surveying the ardent young fellow with an almost fatherly pleasure <\s>
<s> a generous fellow plays for the play a sordid one for the stake an old fogy sits by and smokes the pipe of tranquillity while jack and tom are pummelling each other in the ring <\s>
<s> why don't you come in george and have a turn with the gloves <\s>
<s> you are big enough and strong enough pen said <\s>
<s> dear old boy you are worth ten of me <\s>
<s> you are not quite as tall as goliath certainly the other answered with a laugh that was rough and yet tender <\s>
<s> as for me i am disabled <\s>
<s> i had a fatal hit in early life <\s>
<s> i will tell you about it some day <\s>
<s> you may too meet with your master <\s>
<s> don't be too eager or too confident or too worldly my boy <\s>
<s> was pendennis becoming worldly or only seeing the worldly or both <\s>
<s> and is a man very wrong for being after all only a man <\s>
<s> which is the most reasonable and does his duty best he who stands aloof from the struggle of life calmly contemplating or he who descends to the ground and takes his part in the contest <\s>
<s> that philosopher pen said had held a great place amongst the leaders of the world and enjoyed to the full what it had to give of rank and riches renown and pleasure who came weary hearted out of it and said that all was vanity and vexation of spirit <\s>
<s> many a teacher of those whom we reverence and who steps out of his carriage up to his carved cathedral place shakes his lawn ruffles over the velvet cushions and cries out that the whole struggle is an accursed one and the works of the world are evil <\s>
<s> many a conscience stricken mystic flies from it altogether and shuts himself out from it within convent walls real or spiritual whence he can only look up to the sky and contemplate the heaven out of which there is no rest and no good <\s>
<s> but the earth where our feet are is the work of the same power as the immeasurable blue yonder in which the future lies into which we would peer <\s>
<s> who ordered toil as the condition of life ordered weariness ordered sickness ordered poverty failure success to this man a foremost place to the other a nameless struggle with the crowd to that a shameful fall or paralysed limb or sudden accident to each some work upon the ground he stands on until he is laid beneath it <\s>
<s> while they were talking the dawn came shining through the windows of the room and pen threw them open to receive the fresh morning air <\s>
<s> look george said he look and see the sun rise he sees the labourer on his way a field the work girl plying her poor needle the lawyer at his desk perhaps the beauty smiling asleep upon her pillow of down or the jaded reveller reeling to bed or the fevered patient tossing on it or the doctor watching by it over the throes of the mother for the child that is to be born into the world to be born and to take his part in the suffering and struggling the tears and laughter the crime remorse love folly sorrow rest <\s>
<s> miss amory's partners the noble henry foker of whom we have lost sight for a few pages has been in the meanwhile occupied as we might suppose a man of his constancy would be in the pursuit and indulgence of his all absorbing passion of love <\s>
<s> i wish that a few of my youthful readers who are inclined to that amusement would take the trouble to calculate the time which is spent in the pursuit when they would find it to be one of the most costly occupations in which a man can possibly indulge <\s>
<s> what don't you sacrifice to it indeed young gentlemen and young ladies of ill regulated minds <\s>
<s> many hours of your precious sleep in the first place in which you lie tossing and thinking about the adored object whence you come down late to breakfast when noon is advancing and all the family is long since away to its daily occupations <\s>
<s> then when you at length get to these occupations you pay no attention to them and engage in them with no ardour all your thoughts and powers of mind being fixed elsewhere <\s>
<s> then the day's work being slurred over you neglect your friends and relatives your natural companions and usual associates in life that you may go and have a glance at the dear personage or a look up at her windows or a peep at her carriage in the park <\s>
<s> then at night the artless blandishments of home bore you mamma's conversation palls upon you the dishes which that good soul prepares for the dinner of her favourite are sent away untasted the whole meal of life indeed except one particular plat has no relish <\s>
<s> life business family ties home all things useful and dear once become intolerable and you are never easy except when you are in pursuit of your flame <\s>
<s> such i believe to be not unfrequently the state of mind amongst ill regulated young gentlemen and such indeed was mr <\s>
<s> foker's condition who having been bred up to indulge in every propensity towards which he was inclined abandoned himself to this one with his usual selfish enthusiasm <\s>
<s> nor because he had given his friend arthur pendennis a great deal of good advice on a former occasion need men of the world wonder that mr <\s>
<s> foker became passion's slave in his turn <\s>
<s> who among us has not given a plenty of the very best advice to his friends <\s>
<s> who has not preached and who has practised <\s>
<s> to be sure you madam are perhaps a perfect being and never had a wrong thought in the whole course of your frigid and irreproachable existence or sir you are a great deal too strong minded to allow any foolish passion to interfere with your equanimity in chambers or your attendance on change you are so strong that you don't want any sympathy <\s>
<s> we don't give you any then we keep ours for the humble and weak that struggle and stumble and get up again and so march with the rest of mortals <\s>
<s> what need have you of a hand who never fall <\s>
<s> your serene virtue is never shaded by passion or ruffled by temptation or darkened by remorse compassion would be impertinence for such an angel but then with such a one companionship becomes intolerable you are from the elevation of your very virtue and high attributes of necessity lonely we can't reach up and talk familiarly with such potentatess good bye then our way lies with humble folks and not with serene highnesses like you and we give notice that there are no perfect characters in this history except perhaps one little one and that one is not perfect either for she never knows to this day that she is perfect and with a deplorable misapprehension and perverseness of humility believes herself to be as great a sinner as need be <\s>
<s> this young person does not happen to be in london at the present period of our story and it is by no means for the like of her that mr <\s>
<s> henry foker's mind is agitated <\s>
<s> but what matters a few failings <\s>
<s> need we be angels male or female in order to be worshipped as such <\s>
<s> let us admire the diversity of the tastes of mankind and the oldest the ugliest the stupidest and most pompous the silliest and most vapid the greatest criminal tyrant booby bluebeard catherine hayes george barnwell amongst us we need never despair <\s>
<s> i have read of the passion of a transported pickpocket for a female convict each of them advanced in age being repulsive in person ignorant quarrelsome and given to drink that was as magnificent as the loves of cleopatra and antony or lancelot and guinever <\s>
<s> the passion which count borulawski the polish dwarf inspired in the bosom of the most beautiful baroness at the court of dresden is a matter with which we are all of us acquainted the flame which burned in the heart of young cornet tozer but the other day and caused him to run off and espouse mrs <\s>
<s> battersby who was old enough to be his mamma all these instances are told in the page of history or the newspaper column <\s>
<s> are we to be ashamed or pleased to think that our hearts are formed so that the biggest and highest placed ajax among us may some day find himself prostrate before the pattens of his kitchen maid as that there is no poverty or shame or crime which will not be supported hugged even with delight and cherished more closely than virtue would be by the perverse fidelity and admirable constant folly of a woman <\s>
<s> so then henry foker esquire longed after his love and cursed the fate which separated him from her <\s>
<s> when lord gravesend's family retired to the country his lordship leaving his proxy with the venerable lord bagwig harry still remained lingering on in london certainly not much to the sorrow of lady ann to whom he was affianced and who did not in the least miss him <\s>
<s> wherever miss clavering went this infatuated young fellow continued to follow her and being aware that his engagement to his cousin was known in the world he was forced to make a mystery of his passion and confine it to his own breast so that it was so pent in there and pressed down that it is a wonder he did not explode some day with the stormy secret and perish collapsed after the outburst <\s>
<s> there had been a grand entertainment at gaunt house on one beautiful evening in june and the next day's journals contained almost two columns of the names of the most closely printed nobility and gentry who had been honoured with invitations to the ball <\s>
<s> among the guests were sir francis and lady clavering and miss amory for whom the indefatigable major pendennis had procured an invitation and our two young friends arthur and harry <\s>
<s> each exerted himself and danced a great deal with miss blanche <\s>
<s> as for the worthy major he assumed the charge of lady clavering and took care to introduce her to that department of the mansion where her ladyship specially distinguished herself namely the refreshment room where amongst pictures of titian and giorgione and regal portraits of vandyke and reynolds and enormous salvers of gold and silver and pyramids of large flowers and constellations of wax candles in a manner perfectly regardless of expense in a word a supper was going on all night <\s>
<s> of how many creams jellies salads peaches white soups grapes pates galantines cups of tea champagne and so forth lady clavering partook it does not become us to say <\s>
<s> how much the major suffered as he followed the honest woman about calling to the solemn male attendants and lovely servant maids and administering to lady clavering's various wants with admirable patience nobody knows he never confessed <\s>
<s> he never allowed his agony to appear on his countenance in the least but with a constant kindness brought plate after plate to the begum <\s>
<s> wagg counted up all the dishes of which lady clavering partook as long as he could count but as he partook very freely himself of champagne during the evening his powers of calculation were not to be trusted at the close of the entertainment and he recommended mr <\s>
<s> honeyman lady steyne's medical man to look carefully after the begum and to call and get news of her ladyship the next day <\s>
<s> sir francis clavering made his appearance and skulked for a while about the magnificent rooms but the company and the splendour which he met there were not to the baronet's taste and after tossing off a tumbler of wine or two at the buffet he quitted gaunt house for the neighbourhood of jermyn street where his friends loder punter little moss abramns and captain skewball were assembled at the familiar green table <\s>
<s> in the rattle of the box and of their agreeable conversation sir francis's spirits rose to their accustomed point of feeble hilarity <\s>
<s> pynsent who had asked miss amory to dance came up on one occasion to claim her hand but scowls of recognition having already passed between him and mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis in the dancing room arthur suddenly rose up and claimed miss amory as his partner for the present dance on which mr <\s>
<s> pynsent biting his lips and scowling yet more savagely withdrew with a profound bow saying that he gave up his claim <\s>
<s> there are some men who are always falling in one's way in life <\s>
<s> pynsent and pen had this view of each other and each regarded other accordingly <\s>
<s> what a confounded conceited provincial fool that is <\s>
<s> because he has written a twopenny novel his absurd head is turned and a kicking would take his conceit out of him <\s>
<s> what an impertinent idiot that man is <\s>
<s> remarked the other to his partner <\s>
<s> his soul is in downing street his neckcloth is foolscap his hair is sand his legs are rulers his vitals are tape and sealing wax he was a prig in his cradle and never laughed since he was born except three times at the same joke of his chief <\s>
<s> i have the same liking for that man miss amory i have for that cold boiled veal <\s>
<s> upon which blanche of course remarked that mr <\s>
<s> pendennis was wicked mechant perfectly abominable and wondered what he would say when her back was turned <\s>
<s> say say that you have the most beautiful figure and the slimmest waist in the world blanche miss amory i mean <\s>
<s> i beg your pardon <\s>
<s> another turn this music would make an alderman dance <\s>
<s> and you have left off tumbling when you waltz now <\s>
<s> blanche asked archly looking up at her partner's face <\s>
<s> one falls and one gets up again in life blanche you know i used to call you so in old times and it is the prettiest name in the world <\s>
<s> besides i have practised since then <\s>
<s> and with a great number of partners i'm afraid blanche said with a little sham sigh and a shrug of the shoulders <\s>
<s> and so in truth mr <\s>
<s> pen had practised a good deal in this life and had undoubtedly arrived at being able to dance better <\s>
<s> if pendennis was impertinent in his talk foker on the other hand so bland and communicative on most occasions was entirely mum and melancholy when he danced with miss amory <\s>
<s> to clasp her slender waist was a rapture to whirl round the room with her was a delirium but to speak to her what could he say that was worthy of her <\s>
<s> what pearl of conversation could he bring that was fit for the acceptance of such a queen of love and wit as blanche <\s>
<s> it was she who made the talk when she was in the company of this love stricken partner <\s>
<s> it was she who asked him bow that dear little pony was and looked at him and thanked him with such a tender kindness and regret and refused the dear little pony with such a delicate sigh when he offered it <\s>
<s> i have nobody to ride with in london she said <\s>
<s> mamma is timid and her figure is not pretty on horseback <\s>
<s> sir francis never goes out with me <\s>
<s> he loves me like like a stepdaughter <\s>
<s> oh how delightful it must be to have a father a father mr <\s>
<s> oh uncommon said mr <\s>
<s> harry who enjoyed that blessing very calmly upon which and forgetting the sentimental air which she had just before assumed blanche's grey eyes gazed at foker with such an arch twinkle that both of them burst out laughing and harry enraptured and at his ease began to entertain her with a variety of innocent prattle good kind simple foker talk flavoured with many expressions by no means to be discovered in dictionaries and relating to the personal history of himself or horses or other things dear and important to him or to persons in the ballroom then passing before them and about whose appearance or character mr <\s>
<s> harry spoke with artless freedom and a considerable dash of humour <\s>
<s> and it was blanche who when the conversation flagged and the youth's modesty came rushing back and overpowering him knew how to reanimate her companion asked him questions about logwood and whether it was a pretty place <\s>
<s> whether he was a hunting man and whether he liked women to hunt <\s>
<s> in which case she was prepared to say that she adored hunting but mr <\s>
<s> foker expressing his opinion against sporting females and pointing out lady bullfinch who happened to pass by as a horse godmother whom he had seen at cover with a cigar in her face blanche too expressed her detestation of the sports of the field and said it would make her shudder to think of a dear sweet little fox being killed on which foker laughed and waltzed with renewed vigour and grace <\s>
<s> and at the end of the waltz the last waltz they had on that night blanche asked him about drummington and whether it was a fine house <\s>
<s> his cousins she had heard were very accomplished lord erith she had met and which of his cousins was his favourite <\s>
<s> was it not lady ann <\s>
<s> yes she was sure it was she sure by his looks and his blushes <\s>
<s> she was tired of dancing it was getting very late she must go to mamma and without another word she sprang away from harry foker's arm and seized upon pen's who was swaggering about the dancing room and again said mamma mamma take me to mamma dear mr <\s>
<s> transfixing harry with a parthian shot as she fled from him <\s>
<s> my lord steyne with garter and ribbon with a bald head and shining eyes and a collar of red whiskers round his face always looked grand upon an occasion of state and made a great effect upon lady clavering when he introduced himself to her at the request of the obsequious major pendennis <\s>
<s> with his own white and royal hand he handed to her ladyship a glass of wine said he had heard of her charming daughter and begged to be presented to her and at this very juncture mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis came up with the young lady on his arm <\s>
<s> the peer made a profound bow and blanche the deepest curtesy that ever was seen <\s>
<s> his lordship gave mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis his hand to shake said he had read his book which was very wicked and clever asked miss blanche if she had read it at which pen blushed and winced <\s>
<s> why blanche was one of the heroines of the novel <\s>
<s> blanche in black ringlets and a little altered was the neaera of walter lorraine <\s>
<s> blanche had read it the language of the eyes expressed her admiration and rapture at the performance <\s>
<s> this little play being achieved the marquis of steyne made other two profound bows to lady clavering and her daughter and passed on to some other of his guests at the splendid entertainment <\s>
<s> mamma and daughter were loud in their expressions of admiration of the noble marquis so soon as his broad back was turned upon them <\s>
<s> he said they make a very nice couple whispered major pendennis to lady clavering <\s>
<s> did he now really <\s>
<s> mamma thought they would mamma was so flustered with the honour which had just been shown to her and with other intoxicating events of the evening that her good humour knew no bounds <\s>
<s> she laughed she winked and nodded knowingly at pen she tapped him on the arm with her fan she tapped blanche she tapped the major her contentment was boundless and her method of showing her joy equally expansive <\s>
<s> as the party went down the great staircase of gaunt house the morning had risen stark and clear over the black trees of the square the skies were tinged with pink and the cheeks of some of the people at the ball ah how ghastly they looked <\s>
<s> that admirable and devoted major above all who had been for hours by lady clavering's side ministering to her and feeding her body with everything that was nice and her ear with everything that was sweet and flattering oh <\s>
<s> what an object he was <\s>
<s> the rings round his eyes were of the colour of bistre those orbs themselves were like the plovers eggs whereof lady clavering and blanche had each tasted the wrinkles in his old face were furrowed in deep gashes and a silver stubble like an elderly morning dew was glittering on his chin and alongside the dyed whiskers now limp and out of curl <\s>
<s> there he stood with admirable patience enduring uncomplainingly a silent agony knowing that people could see the state of his face for could he not himself perceive the condition of others males and females of his own age longing to go to rest for hours past aware that suppers disagreed with him and yet having eaten a little so as to keep his friend lady clavering in good humour with twinges of rheumatism in the back and knees with weary feet burning in his varnished boots so tired oh so tired and longing for bed <\s>
<s> if a man struggling with hardship and bravely overcoming it is an object of admiration for the gods that power in whose chapels the old major was a faithful worshipper must have looked upwards approvingly upon the constancy of pendennis's martyrdom <\s>
<s> there are sufferers in that cause as in the other the negroes in the service of mumbo jumbo tattoo and drill themselves with burning skewers with great fortitude and we read that the priests in the service of baal gashed themselves and bled freely <\s>
<s> you who can smash the idols do so with a good courage but do not be too fierce with the idolaters they worship the best thing they know <\s>
<s> the pendennises the elder and the younger waited with lady clavering and her daughter until her ladyship's carriage was announced when the elder's martyrdom may be said to have come to an end for the good natured begum insisted upon leaving him at his door in bury street so he took the back seat of the carriage after a feeble bow or two and speech of thanks polite to the last and resolute in doing his duty <\s>
<s> the begum waved her dumpy little hand by way of farewell to arthur and foker and blanche smiled languidly out upon the young men thinking whether she looked very wan and green under her rose coloured hood and whether it was the mirrors at gaunt house or the fatigue and fever of her own eyes which made her fancy herself so pale <\s>
<s> arthur perhaps saw quite well how yellow blanche looked but did not attribute that peculiarity of her complexion to the effect of the looking glasses or to any error in his sight or her own <\s>
<s> our young man of the world could use his eyes very keenly and could see blanche's face pretty much as nature had made it <\s>
<s> but for poor foker it had a radiance which dazzled and blinded him he could see no more faults in it than in the sun which was now flaring over the house tops <\s>
<s> amongst other wicked london habits which pen had acquired the moralist will remark that he had got to keep very bad hours and often was going to bed at the time when sober country people were thinking of leaving it <\s>
<s> men get used to one hour as to another <\s>
<s> editors of newspapers covent garden market people night cabmen and coffee sellers chimney sweeps and gentlemen and ladies of fashion who frequent balls are often quite lively at three or four o'clock of a morning when ordinary mortals are snoring <\s>
<s> we have shown in the last chapter how pen was in a brisk condition of mind at this period inclined to smoke his cigar at ease and to speak freely <\s>
<s> foker and pen walked away from gaunt house then indulging in both the above amusements or rather pen talked and foker looked as if he wanted to say something <\s>
<s> pen was sarcastic and dandified when he had been in the company of great folks he could not help imitating some of their airs and tones and having a most lively imagination mistook himself for a person of importance very easily <\s>
<s> he rattled away and attacked this person and that sneered at lady john turnbull's bad french which her ladyship will introduce into all conversations in spite of the sneers of everybody at mrs <\s>
<s> slack roper's extraordinary costume and sham jewels at the old dandies and the young ones at whom didn't he sneer and laugh <\s>
<s> you fire at everybody pen you're grown awful that you are foker said <\s>
<s> now you've pulled about blondel's yellow wig and colchicum's black one why don't you have a shy at a brown one hay <\s>
<s> you know whose i mean <\s>
<s> it got into lady clavering's carriage <\s>
<s> under my uncle's hat <\s>
<s> my uncle is a martyr foker my boy <\s>
<s> my uncle has been doing excruciating duties all night <\s>
<s> he likes to go to bed rather early <\s>
<s> he has a dreadful headache if he sits up and touches supper <\s>

<s> he has been sitting up and standing up and supping <\s>
<s> he has gone home to the gout and the headache and for my sake <\s>
<s> shall i make fun of the old boy <\s>
<s> no not for venice <\s>
<s> how do you mean that he has been doing it for your sake <\s>
<s> foker asked looking rather alarmed <\s>
<s> canst thou keep a secret if i impart it to thee <\s>
<s> pen cried out in high spirits <\s>
<s> art thou of good counsel <\s>
<s> wilt thou be mum or wilt thou preach <\s>
<s> wilt thou be silent and hear or wilt thou speak and die <\s>
<s> and as he spoke flinging himself into an absurd theatrical attitude the men in the cabstand in piccadilly wondered and grinned at the antics of the two young swells <\s>
<s> what the doose are you driving at <\s>
<s> foker asked looking very much agitated <\s>
<s> pen however did not remark this agitation much but continued in the same bantering and excited vein <\s>
<s> henry friend of my youth he said and witness of my early follies though dull at thy books yet thou art not altogether deprived of sense nay blush not henrico thou hast a good portion of that and of courage and kindness too at the service of thy friends <\s>

<s> shall we stop and have a drop of coffee at this stall it looks very hot and nice <\s>
<s> look how that cabman is blowing at his saucer <\s>
<s> i resume my tale <\s>

<s> pendennis and a house near the parks for the accommodation of the children <\s>
<s> answer thy friend thou worthy child of beer <\s>
<s> speak i adjure thee by all thy vats <\s>
<s> but you ain't got any money pen said the other still looking alarmed <\s>
<s> no but she ave <\s>
<s> i tell thee there is gold in store for me not what you call money nursed in the lap of luxury and cradled on grains and drinking in wealth from a thousand mash tubs <\s>
<s> what do you know about money <\s>

<s> you can't live without an establishment and your houses in town and country <\s>
<s> a snug little house somewhere off belgravia a brougham for my wife a decent cook and a fair bottle of wine for my friends at home sometimes these simple necessaries suffice for me my foker <\s>
<s> and here pendennis began to look more serious <\s>
<s> without bantering further pen continued i've rather serious thoughts of settling and marrying <\s>
<s> no man can get on in the world without some money at his back <\s>
<s> you must have a certain stake to begin with before you can go in and play the great game <\s>

<s> foker's door by this time and opening it harry walked with his friend into his apartments which were situated in the back part of the house and behind the family dining room where the elder foker received his guests surrounded by pictures of himself his wife his infant son on a donkey and the late earl of gravesend in his robes as a peer <\s>

<s> i can't help telling you pen he said <\s>
<s> ever since the night we dined there i'm so fond of that girl that i think i shall die if i don't get her <\s>
<s> i feel as if i should go mad sometimes <\s>
<s> i can't stand it pen <\s>
<s> i couldn't bear to hear you talking about her just now about marrying her only because she's money <\s>
<s> that ain't the question in marrying <\s>
<s> i'd bet anything it ain't <\s>
<s> talking about money and such a girl as that it's it's what d'ye call 'em you know what i mean i ain't good at talking sacrilege then <\s>
<s> if she'd have me i'd take and sweep a crossing that i would <\s>
<s> i don't think that would tempt her pen said eyeing his friend with a great deal of real good nature and pity <\s>
<s> she is not a girl for love and a cottage <\s>
<s> she ought to be a duchess i know that very well and i know she wouldn't take me unless i could make her a great place in the world for i ain't good for anything myself much i ain't clever and that sort of thing foker said sadly <\s>
<s> if i had all the diamonds that all the duchesses and marchionesses had on to night wouldn't i put em in her lap <\s>
<s> but what's the use of talking <\s>
<s> i'm booked for another race <\s>
<s> it's that kills me pen <\s>
<s> i can't get out of it though i die i can't get out of it <\s>
<s> and though my cousin's a nice girl and i like her very well and that yet i hadn't seen this one when our governors settled that matter between us <\s>
<s> and when you talked just now about her doing very well and about her having money enough for both of you i thought to myself it isn't money or mere liking a girl that ought to be enough to make a fellow marry <\s>
<s> he may marry and find he likes somebody else better <\s>
<s> all the money in the world won't make you happy then <\s>
<s> look at me i've plenty of money or shall have out of the mash tubs as you call em <\s>
<s> my governor thought he'd made it all right for me in settling my marriage with my cousin <\s>
<s> i tell you it won't do; and when lady ann has got her husband it won't be happy for either of us and she'll have the most miserable beggar in town <\s>
<s> pen said with rather a cheap magnanimity i wish i could help you <\s>
<s> i had no idea of this and that you were so wild about the girl <\s>
<s> do you think she would have you without your money <\s>
<s> do you think your father would agree to break off your engagement with your cousin <\s>
<s> you know him very well and that he would cast you off rather than do so <\s>
<s> the unhappy foker only groaned a reply flinging himself prostrate on a sofa face forwards his head in his hands <\s>
<s> as for my affair pen went on my dear fellow if i had thought matters were so critical with you at least i would not have pained you by choosing you as my confidant <\s>
<s> and my business is not serious at least not as yet <\s>
<s> i have not spoken a word about it to miss amory <\s>
<s> very likely she would not have me if i asked her <\s>
<s> only i have had a great deal of talk about it with my uncle who says that the match might be an eligible one for me <\s>
<s> i'm ambitious and i'm poor <\s>
<s> and it appears lady clavering will give her a good deal of money and sir francis might be got to never mind the rest <\s>
<s> nothing is settled harry <\s>
<s> they are going out of town directly <\s>
<s> i promise you i won't ask her before she goes <\s>
<s> there's no hurry there's time for everybody <\s>
<s> but suppose you got her foker <\s>
<s> remember what you said about marriages just now and the misery of a man who doesn't care for his wife and what sort of a wife would you have who didn't care for her husband <\s>
<s> but she would care for me said foker from his sofa that is i think she would <\s>
<s> last night only as we were dancing she said what did she say <\s>
<s> pen cried starting up in great wrath <\s>
<s> but he saw his own meaning more clearly than foker and broke off with a laugh well never mind what she said harry <\s>
<s> miss amory is a clever girl and says numbers of civil things to you to me perhaps and who the deuce knows to whom besides <\s>
<s> nothing's settled old boy <\s>
<s> at least my heart won't break if i don't get her <\s>
<s> win her if you can and i wish you joy of her <\s>
<s> don't think about what i said to you <\s>

<s> arthur pendennis giving a very queer and rather dangerous look at his companion shook him by the hand with something of that sort of cordiality which befitted his just repeated simile of the boxing match and which mr <\s>

<s> foker returned his friend's salute with an imploring look and a piteous squeeze of the hand sank back on his cushions again and pen putting on his hat strode forth into the air and almost over the body of the matutinal housemaid who was rubbing the steps at the door <\s>
<s> and so he wants her too does be <\s>
<s> thought pen as he marched along and noted within himself with a fatal keenness of perception and almost an infernal mischief that the very pains and tortures which that honest heart of foker's was suffering gave a zest and an impetus to his own pursuit of blanche if pursuit might be called which had been no pursuit as yet but mere sport and idle dallying <\s>
<s> she said something to him did she <\s>
<s> perhaps she gave him the fellow flower to this and he took out of his coat and twiddled in his thumb and finger a poor little shrivelled crumpled bud that had faded and blackened with the heat and flare of the night i wonder to how many more she has given her artless tokens of affection the little flirt and he flung his into the gutter where the water may have refreshed it and where any amateur of rosebuds may have picked it up <\s>
<s> and then bethinking him that the day was quite bright and that the passers by by might be staring at his beard and white neckcloth our modest young gentleman took a cab and drove to the temple <\s>
<s> is this the boy that prayed at his mother's knee but a few years since and for whom very likely at this hour of morning she is praying <\s>
<s> is this jaded and selfish worldling the lad who a short while back was ready to fling away his worldly all his hope his ambition his chance of life for his love <\s>
<s> this is the man you are proud of old pendennis <\s>
<s> you boast of having formed him and of having reasoned him out of his absurd romance and folly and groaning in your bed over your pains and rheumatisms satisfy yourself still by thinking that at last that lad will do something to better himself in life and that the pendennises will take a good place in the world <\s>
<s> and is he the only one who in his progress through this dark life goes wilfully or fatally astray whilst the natural truth and love which should illumine him grow dim in the poisoned air and suffice to light him no more <\s>
<s> when pen was gone away poor harry foker got up from the sofa and taking out from his waistcoat the splendidly buttoned but the gorgeously embroidered the work of his mamma a little white rosebud he drew from his dressing case also the maternal present a pair of scissors with which he nipped carefully the stalk of the flower and placing it in a glass of water opposite his bed he sought refuge there from care and bitter remembrances <\s>
<s> it is to be presumed that miss blanche amory had more than one rose in her bouquet and why should not the kind young creature give out of her superfluity and make as many partners as possible happy <\s>
<s> monseigneur s'amuse the exertions of that last night at gaunt house had proved almost too much for major pendennis and as soon as he could move his weary old body with safety he transported himself groaning to buxton and sought relief in the healing waters of that place <\s>
<s> sir francis clavering and family left town and the affairs which we have just mentioned to the reader were not advanced in the brief interval of a few days or weeks which have occurred between this and the last chapter <\s>

<s> the season was now come to a conclusion pen's neighbours the lawyers were gone upon circuit and his more fashionable friends had taken their passports for the continent or had fled for health or excitement to the scotch moors <\s>
<s> scarce a man was to be seen in the bow windows of the clubs or on the solitary pall mall pavement <\s>
<s> the red jackets had disappeared from before the palace gate the tradesmen of st <\s>

<s> james's only preached to half a congregation in which there was not a single sinner of distinction the band in kensington gardens had shut up their instruments of brass and trumpets of silver only two or three old flies and chaises crawled by the banks of the serpentine and clarence bulbul who was retained in town by his arduous duties as a treasury clerk when he took his afternoon ride in rotten row compared its loneliness to the vastness of the arabian desert and himself to a bedouin wending his way through that dusty solitude <\s>
<s> warrington stowed away a quantity of cavendish tobacco in his carpet bag and betook himself as his custom was in the vacation to his brother's house in norfolk <\s>
<s> pen was left alone in chambers for a while for this man of fashion could not quit the metropolis when he chose always and was at present detained by the affairs of his newspaper the pall mall gazette of which he acted as the editor and charge d'affaires during the temporary absence of the chief captain shandon who was with his family at the salutary watering place of boulogne sur mer <\s>
<s> although as we have seen mr <\s>
<s> pen had pronounced himself for years past to be a man perfectly blase and wearied of life yet the truth is that he was an exceedingly healthy young fellow still with a fine appetite which he satisfied with the greatest relish and satisfaction at least once a day and a constant desire for society which showed him to be anything but misanthropical <\s>
<s> if he could not get a good dinner he sate down to a bad one with perfect contentment if he could not procure the company of witty or great or beautiful persons he put up with any society that came to hand and was perfectly satisfied in a tavern parlour or on board a greenwich steamboat or in a jaunt to hampstead with mr <\s>
<s> finucane his colleague at the pall mall gazette or in a visit to the summer theatres across the river or to the royal gardens of vauxhall where he was on terms of friendship with the great simpson and where he shook the principal comic singer of the lovely equestrian of the arena by the hand <\s>
<s> and while he could watch the grimaces or the graces of these with a satiric humour that was not deprived of sympathy he could look on with an eye of kindness at the lookers on too at the roystering youth bent upon enjoyment and here taking it at the honest parents with their delighted children laughing and clapping their hands at the show at the poor outcasts whose laughter was less innocent though perhaps louder and who brought their shame and their youth here to dance and be merry till the dawn at least and to get bread and drown care <\s>
<s> of this sympathy with all conditions of men arthur often boasted said he was pleased to possess it and that he hoped thus to the last he should retain it <\s>
<s> as another man has an ardour for art or music or natural science mr <\s>
<s> pen said that anthropology was his favourite pursuit and had his eyes always eagerly open to its infinite varieties and beauties contemplating with an unfailing delight all specimens of it in all places to which he resorted whether it was the coquetting of a wrinkled dowager in a ballroom or a high bred young beauty blushing in her prime there whether it was a hulking guardsman coaxing a servant girl in the park or innocent little tommy that was feeding the ducks whilst the nurse listened <\s>
<s> and indeed a man whose heart is pretty clean can indulge in this pursuit with an enjoyment that never ceases and is only perhaps the more keen because it is secret and has a touch of sadness in it because he is of his mood and humour lonely and apart although not alone <\s>
<s> yes pen used to brag and talk in his impetuous way to warrington <\s>
<s> i was in love so fiercely in my youth that i have burned out that flame for ever i think and if ever i marry it will be a marriage of reason that i will make with a well bred good tempered good looking person who has a little money and so forth that will cushion our carriage in its course through life <\s>
<s> as for romance it is all done i have spent that out and am old before my time i'm proud of it <\s>
<s> growled the other you fancied you were getting bald the other day and bragged about it as you do about everything <\s>
<s> but you began to use the bear's grease pot directly the hairdresser told you and are scented like a barber ever since <\s>
<s> you are diogenes the other answered and you want every man to live in a tub like yourself <\s>
<s> violets smell better than stale tobacco you grizzly old cynic <\s>
<s> pen was blushing whilst he made this reply to his unromantical friend and indeed cared a great deal more about himself still than such a philosopher perhaps should have done <\s>
<s> indeed considering that he was careless about the world mr <\s>
<s> pen ornamented his person with no small pains in order to make himself agreeable to it and for a weary pilgrim as he was wore very tight boots and bright varnish <\s>
<s> it was in this dull season of the year then of a shining friday night in autumn that mr <\s>
<s> pendennis having completed at his newspaper office a brilliant leading article such as captain shandon himself might have written had the captain been in good humour and inclined to work which he never would do except under compulsion that mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis having written his article and reviewed it approvingly as it lay before him in its wet proof sheet at the office of the paper bethought him that he would cross the water and regale himself with the fireworks and other amusements of vauxhall <\s>
<s> so he affably put in his pocket the order which admitted editor of pall mall gazette and friend to that place of recreation and paid with the coin of the realm a sufficient sum to enable him to cross waterloo bridge <\s>

<s> as for the young one she looked up at the captain and said never mind captain costigan i'm sure i don't want to go at all <\s>
<s> and with this although she did not want to go at all her feelings overcame her and she began to cry <\s>
<s> can ye see that sir and will ye not let this innocent creature in <\s>
<s> it ain't my business cried the doorkeeper peevishly out of the illuminated box <\s>
<s> and at this minute arthur came up and recognising costigan said don't you know me captain <\s>
<s> and he took off his hat and made a bow to the two ladies <\s>
<s> cried the captain extending towards pendennis the grasp of friendship and he rapidly explained to the other what he called a most unluckee conthratong <\s>
<s> he had an order for vauxhall admitting two from mr <\s>
<s> hodgen then within the gardens and singing as he did at the back kitchen and the nobility's concerts the body snatcher the death of general wolfe the banner of blood and other favourite melodies ); and having this order for the admission of two persons he thought that it would admit three and had come accordingly to the gardens with his friends <\s>
<s> but on his way captain costigan had lost the paper of admission it was not forthcoming at all and the leedies must go back again to the great disappointment of one of them as pendennis saw <\s>
<s> arthur had a great deal of good nature for everybody and sympathised with the misfortunes of all sorts of people how could he refuse his sympathy in such a case as this <\s>
<s> he had seen the innocent face as it looked up to the captain the appealing look of the girl the piteous quiver of the mouth and the final outburst of tears <\s>
<s> if it had been his last guinea in the world he must have paid it to have given the poor little thing pleasure <\s>
<s> she turned the sad imploring eyes away directly they lighted upon a stranger and began to wipe them with her handkerchief <\s>
<s> arthur looked very handsome and kind as he stood before the women with his hat off blushing bowing generous a gentleman <\s>
<s> he asked of himself <\s>
<s> he thought he had seen the elder lady before <\s>
<s> if i can be of any service to you captain costigan the young man said i hope you will command me is there any difficulty about taking these ladies into the garden <\s>
<s> will you kindly make use of my purse <\s>
<s> and and i have a ticket myself which will admit two i hope ma'am you will permit me <\s>
<s> the first impulse of the prince of fairoaks was to pay for the whole party and to make away with his newspaper order as poor costigan had done with his own ticket <\s>
<s> but his instinct and the appearance of the two women told him that they would be better pleased if he did not give himself the airs of a grand seigneur and he handed his purse to costigan and laughingly pulled out his ticket with one hand as he offered the other to the elder of the ladies ladies was not the word they had bonnets and shawls and collars and ribbons and the youngest showed a pretty little foot and boot under her modest grey gown but his highness of fairoaks was courteous to every person who wore a petticoat whatever its texture was and the humbler the wearer only the more stately and polite in his demeanour <\s>
<s> fanny take the gentleman's arm the elder said since you will be so very kind i've seen you often come in at our gate sir and go in to captain strong's at no <\s>
<s> fanny made a little curtsey and put her hand under arthur's arm <\s>
<s> it had on a shabby little glove but it was pretty and small <\s>
<s> she was not a child but she was scarcely a woman as yet her tears had dried up and her cheek mantled with youthful blushes and her eyes glistened with pleasure and gratitude as she looked up into arthur's kind face <\s>

<s> fanny's a very pretty little name he said and so you know me do you <\s>
<s> we keep the lodge sir at shepherd's inn fanny said with a curtsey and i've never been at vauxhall sir and papa didn't like me to go and and o o law how beautiful <\s>
<s> she shrank back as she spoke starting with wonder and delight as she saw the royal gardens blaze before her with a hundred million of lamps with a splendour such as the finest fairy tale the finest pantomime she had ever witnessed at the theatre had never realised <\s>
<s> pen was pleased with her pleasure and pressed to his side the little hand which clung so kindly to him <\s>
<s> what would i not give for a little of this pleasure <\s>

<s> simpson your humble servant sir <\s>
<s> if pen was magnificent in his courtesy to the ladies what was his splendour in comparison to captain costigan's bowing here and there and crying bravo to the singers <\s>
<s> a man descended like costigan from a long line of hibernian kings chieftains and other magnates and sheriffs of the county had of course too much dignity and self respect to walk arrum in arrum as the captain phrased it with a lady who occasionally swept his room out and cooked his mutton chops <\s>
<s> in the course of their journey from shepherd's inn to vauxhall gardens captain costigan had walked by the side of the two ladies in a patronising and affable manner pointing out to them the edifices worthy of note and discoorsing according to his wont about other cities and countries which he had visited and the people of rank and fashion with whom he had the honour of an acquaintance <\s>
<s> nor could it be expected nor indeed did mrs <\s>
<s> bolton expect that arrived in the royal property and strongly illuminated by the flare of the twenty thousand additional lamps the captain could relax from his dignity and give an arm to a lady who was in fact little better than a housekeeper or charwoman <\s>
<s> but pen on his part had no such scruples <\s>
<s> miss fanny bolton did not make his bed nor sweep his chambers and he did not choose to let go his pretty little partner <\s>
<s> as for fanny her colour heightened and her bright eyes shone the brighter with pleasure as she leaned for protection on the arm of such a fine gentleman as mr <\s>
<s> and she looked at numbers of other ladies in the place and at scores of other gentlemen under whose protection they were walking here and there and she thought that her gentleman was handsomer and grander looking than any other gent in the place <\s>
<s> of course there were votaries of pleasure of all ranks there rakish young surgeons fast young clerks and commercialists occasional dandies of the guard regiments and the rest <\s>
<s> old lord colchicum was there in attendance upon mademoiselle caracoline who had been riding in the ring and who talked her native french very loud and used idiomatic expressions of exceeding strength as she walked about leaning on the arm of his lordship <\s>
<s> colchicum was in attendance upon mademoiselle carandine little tom tufthunt was in attendance upon lord colchicum and rather pleased too with his position <\s>
<s> when don juan scalles the wall there's never a want of a leporello to hold the ladder <\s>

<s> when pen and his young lady met the viscount's party that noble poor only gave arthur a passing leer of recognition as his lordship's eyes passed from pen's face under the bonnet of pen's companion <\s>
<s> but tom tufthunt wagged his head very good naturedly at mr <\s>
<s> arthur and said how are you old boy <\s>
<s> and looked extremely knowing at the godfather of this history <\s>
<s> that is the great rider at astley's i have seen her there miss bolton said looking after mademoiselle caracoline and who is that old man <\s>
<s> is it not the gentleman in the ring <\s>
<s> that is lord viscount colchicum miss fanny said pen with an air of protection <\s>
<s> he meant no harm he was pleased to patronise the young girl and he was not displeased that she should be so pretty and that she should be hanging upon his arm and that yonder elderly don juan should have seen her there <\s>
<s> fanny was very pretty her eyes were dark and brilliant her teeth were like little pearls her mouth was almost as red as mademoiselle caracoline's when the latter had put on her vermilion <\s>
<s> and what a difference there was between the one's voice and the other's between the girl's laugh and the woman's <\s>
<s> it was only very lately indeed that fanny when looking in the little glass over the bows costigan mantelpiece as she was dusting it had begun to suspect that she was a beauty <\s>
<s> but a year ago she was a clumsy gawky girl at whom her father sneered and of whom the girls at the day school miss minifer's newcastle street strand miss m the younger sister took the leading business at the norwich circuit in 182 and she herself had played for two seasons with some credit t <\s>
<s> w until she fell down a trap door and broke her leg ); the girls at fanny's school we say took no account of her and thought her a dowdy little creature as long as she remained under miss minifer's instruction <\s>

<s> momus sang his most stunning comic songs and asked his most astonishing riddles never did a kind smile come to visit foker's lips <\s>
<s> in fact he never heard mr <\s>
<s> pen and miss bolton were hard by listening to the same concert and the latter remarked and pen laughed at mr <\s>
<s> fanny asked what it was that made that odd looking little man so dismal <\s>
<s> i think he is crossed in love <\s>
<s> isn't that enough to make any man dismal fanny <\s>

<s> how dy do mr <\s>
<s> pendennis a voice broke in here it was that of a young man in a large white coat with a red neckcloth over which a dingy shirt collar was turned so as to exhibit a dubious neck with a large pin of bullion or other metal and an imaginative waistcoat with exceedingly fanciful glass buttons and trousers that cried with a loud voice come look at me and see how cheap and tawdry i am my master what a dirty buck <\s>
<s> and a little stick in one pocket of his coat and a lady in pink satin on the other arm how dy do forget me i dare say <\s>

<s> if ever you are passing look up our place i'm mostly at home saturdays and there's generally a cheese cupboard <\s>

<s> so did pen presently when this agreeable youth was out of sight begin to run with his little companion mrs <\s>

<s> perhaps arthur forgot or perhaps he did not choose to remember that the elder couple had no money in their pockets as had been proved by their adventure at the entrance of the gardens howbeit pen paid a couple of shillings for himself and his partner and with her hanging close on his arm scaled the staircase which leads to the firework gallery <\s>

<s> what would you wish me to say sir <\s>
<s> well i forgot it is best so my dear pendennis said very kindly and gently <\s>
<s> i may call you fanny <\s>
<s> she said and the little hand pressed his arm once more very eagerly and the girl clung to him so that he could feel her heart beating on his shoulder <\s>
<s> i may call you fanny because you are a young girl and a good girl fanny and i am an old gentleman <\s>
<s> but you mustn't call me anything but sir or mr <\s>
<s> pendennis if you like for we live in very different stations fanny and don't think i speak unkindly and and why do you take your hand away fanny <\s>
<s> are you afraid of me <\s>
<s> do you think i would hurt you <\s>
<s> not for all the world my dear little girl <\s>
<s> and and look how beautiful the moon and stars are and how calmly they shine when the rockets have gone out and the noisy wheels have done hissing and blazing <\s>

<s> you must know i live by myself and work very hard <\s>
<s> i write in books and newspapers fanny and i quite tired out and was expected to sit alone all night and don't cry my dear dear little girl <\s>
<s> here pen broke out rapidly putting an end to the calm oration which he had begun to deliver for the sight of a woman's tears always put his nerves in a quiver and he began forthwith to coax her and soothe her and to utter a hundred and twenty little ejaculations of pity and sympathy which need not be repeated here because they would be absurd in print <\s>
<s> so would a mother's talk to a child be absurd in print so would a lover's to his bride <\s>

<s> arthur pendennis made any use of the monosyllable in question <\s>
<s> in the first place it was dark the fireworks were over and nobody could see him secondly he was not a man to have this kind of secret and tell it thirdly and lastly let the honest fellow who has kissed a pretty girl say what would have been his own conduct in such a delicate juncture <\s>
<s> well the truth is that however you may suspect him and whatever you would have done under the circumstances or mr <\s>
<s> pen would have liked to do he behaved honestly and like a man <\s>
<s> i will not play with this little girl's heart he said within himself and forget my own or her honour <\s>

<s> don't stumble you heedless little thing this is the way and there is your mamma at the door <\s>
<s> and there indeed mrs <\s>
<s> bolton was unquiet in spirit and grasping her umbrella <\s>
<s> she seized fanny with maternal fierceness and eagerness and uttered some rapid abuse to the girl in an undertone <\s>
<s> the expression in captain costigan's eye standing behind the matron and winking at pendennis from under his hat was i am bound to say indefinably humorous <\s>
<s> it was so much so that pen could not refrain from bursting into a laugh <\s>
<s> you should have taken my arm mrs <\s>

<s> i am very glad to bring miss fanny back quite safe to you <\s>
<s> we thought you would have followed us up into the gallery <\s>
<s> we enjoyed the fireworks didn't we <\s>
<s> said miss fanny with rather a demure look <\s>
<s> and the bouquet was magnificent said pen <\s>
<s> and it is ten hours since i had anything to eat ladies and i wish you would permit me to invite you to supper <\s>
<s> dad said costigan i'd loike a snack to only i forgawt me purse or i should have invoited these leedies to a collection <\s>
<s> bolton with considerable asperity said she ad an eadache and would much rather go ome <\s>

<s> give me your arm give me the umbrella <\s>
<s> costigan i'm sure you'll take care of miss fanny and i shall think mrs <\s>
<s> bolton angry with me unless she will favour me with her society <\s>
<s> and we will all sup quietly and go back in a cab together <\s>
<s> the cab the lobster salad the frank and good humoured look of pendennis as he smilingly invited the worthy matron subdued her suspicions and her anger <\s>
<s> since he would be so obliging she thought she could take a little bit of lobster and so they all marched away to a box and costigan called for a waither with such a loud and belligerent voice as caused one of those officials instantly to run to him <\s>
<s> the carte was examined on the wall and fanny was asked to choose her favourite dish upon which the young creature said she was fond of lobster too but also owned to a partiality for raspberry tart <\s>
<s> this delicacy was provided by pen and a bottle of the most frisky champagne was moreover ordered for the delight of the ladies <\s>
<s> little fanny drank this what other sweet intoxication had she not drunk in the course of the night <\s>
<s> when the supper which was very brisk and gay was over and captain costigan and mrs <\s>
<s> bolton had partaken of some of the rack punch that is so fragrant at vauxhall the bill was called and discharged by pen with great generosity loike a foin young english gentleman of th olden toime be jove costigan enthusiastically remarked <\s>
<s> and as when they went out of the box he stepped forward and gave mrs <\s>
<s> bolton his arm fanny fell to pen's lot and the young people walked away in high good humour together in the wake of their seniors <\s>
<s> the champagne and the rack punch though taken in moderation by all persons except perhaps poor cos who lurched ever so little in his gait had set them in high spirits and good humour so that fanny began to skip and move her brisk little feet in time to the band which was playing waltzes and galops for the dancers <\s>
<s> as they came up to the dancing the music and fanny's feet seemed to go quicker together she seemed to spring as if naturally from the ground and as if she required repression to keep her there <\s>
<s> shouldn't you like a turn <\s>
<s> said the prince of fairoaks <\s>
<s> what fun it would be <\s>
<s> bolton ma'am do let me take her once round <\s>
<s> costigan said off wid you <\s>
<s> bolton not refusing indeed she was an old war horse and would have liked at the trumpet's sound to have entered the arena herself fanny's shawl was off her back in a minute and she and arthur were whirling round in a waltz in the midst of a great deal of queer but exceedingly joyful company <\s>
<s> pen had no mishap this time with little fanny as he had with miss blanche in old days at least there was no mishap of his making <\s>
<s> the pair danced away with great agility and contentment first a waltz then a galop then a waltz again until in the second waltz they were bumped by another couple who had joined the terpsichorean choir <\s>
<s> huxter and his pink satin young friend of whom we have already had a glimpse <\s>
<s> huxter very probably had been also partaking of supper for he was even more excited now than at the time when he had previously claimed pen's acquaintance and having run against arthur and his partner and nearly knocked them down this amiable gentleman of course began to abuse the people whom he had injured and broke out into a volley of slang against the unoffending couple <\s>
<s> don't keep the ground if you can't dance old slow coach <\s>
<s> the young surgeon roared out using at the same time other expressions far more emphatic and was joined in his abuse by the shrill language and laughter of his partner to the interruption of the ball the terror of poor little fanny and the immense indignation of pen <\s>
<s> arthur was furious and not so angry at the quarrel as at the shame attending it <\s>
<s> a battle with a fellow like that <\s>
<s> a row in a public garden and with a porter's daughter on his arm <\s>
<s> what a position for arthur pendennis <\s>
<s> he drew poor little fanny hastily away from the dancers to her mother and wished that lady and costigan and poor fanny underground rather than there in his companionship and under his protection <\s>
<s> when huxter commenced his attack that free spoken young gentleman had not seen who was his opponent and directly he was aware that it was arthur whom he had insulted he began to make apologies <\s>
<s> hold your stoopid tongue mary he said to his partner <\s>
<s> it's an old friend and crony at home <\s>
<s> i beg pardon pendennis wasn't aware it was you old boy <\s>
<s> huxter had been one of the boys of the clavering school who had been present at a combat which has been mentioned in the early part of this story when young pen knocked down the biggest champion of the academy and huxter knew that it was dangerous to quarrel with arthur <\s>
<s> his apologies were as odious to the other as his abuse had been <\s>
<s> pen stopped his tipsy remonstrance by telling him to hold his tongue and desiring him not to use his pendennis's name in that place or any other and he walked out of the gardens with a titter behind him from the crowd every one of whom he would have liked to massacre for having been witness to the degrading broil <\s>
<s> he walked out of the gardens quite forgetting poor little fanny who came trembling behind him with her mother and the stately costigan <\s>
<s> he was brought back to himself by a word from the captain who touched him on the shoulder just as they were passing the inner gate <\s>
<s> there's no ray admittance except ye pay again the captain said <\s>
<s> hadn't i better go back and take the fellow your message <\s>
<s> pen burst out laughing <\s>
<s> take him a message <\s>
<s> do you think i would fight with such a fellow as that <\s>
<s> cried out little fanny <\s>
<s> how can you be so wicked captain costigan <\s>
<s> the captain muttered something about honour and winked knowingly at pen but arthur said gallantly no fanny don't be frightened <\s>
<s> it was my fault to have danced in such a place i beg your padon to have asked you to dance there <\s>
<s> and he gave her his arm once more and called a cab and put his three friends into it <\s>
<s> he was about to pay the driver and to take another carriage for himself when little fanny still alarmed put her little hand out and caught him by the coat and implored him and besought him to come in <\s>
<s> will nothing satisfy you said pen in great good humour that i am not going back to fight him <\s>
<s> well i will come home with you <\s>
<s> drive to shepherd's inn cab <\s>
<s> the cab drove to its destination <\s>
<s> arthur was immensely pleased by the girl's solicitude about him her tender terrors quite made him forget his previous annoyance <\s>
<s> pen put the ladies into their lodge having shaken hands kindly with both of them and the captain again whispered to him that he would see um in the morning if he was inclined and take his message to that scounthrel <\s>
<s> but the captain was in his usual condition when he made the proposal and pen was perfectly sure that neither he nor mr <\s>
<s> huxter when they awoke would remember anything about the dispute <\s>
<s> a visit of politeness costigan never roused pen from his slumbers there was no hostile message from mr <\s>
<s> huxter to disturb him and when pen woke it was with a brisker and more lively feeling than ordinarily attends that moment in the day of the tired and blase london man <\s>
<s> a city man wakes up to care and consols and the thoughts of change and the counting house take possession of him as soon as sleep flies from under his night cap a lawyer rouses himself with the early morning to think of the case that will take him all his day to work upon and the inevitable attorney to whom he has promised his papers ere night <\s>
<s> which of us has not his anxiety instantly present when his eyes are opened to it and to the world after his night's sleep <\s>
<s> kind strengthener that enables us to face the day's task with renewed heart <\s>
<s> beautiful ordinance of providence that creates rest as it awards labour <\s>
<s> pendennis's labour or rather his disposition was of that sort that his daily occupations did not much interest him for the excitement of literary composition pretty soon subsides with the hired labourer and the delight of seeing one's self in print only extends to the first two or three appearances in the magazine or newspaper page <\s>
<s> pegasus put into harness and obliged to run a stage every day is as prosaic as any other hack and won't work without his whip or his feed of corn <\s>
<s> arthur performed his work at the pall mall gazette and since his success as a novelist with an increased salary but without the least enthusiasm doing his best or pretty nearly and sometimes writing ill and sometimes well <\s>
<s> he was a literary hack naturally fast in pace and brilliant in action <\s>
<s> neither did society or that portion which he saw excite or amuse him over much <\s>
<s> in spite of his brag and boast to the contrary he was too young as yet for women's society which probably can only be had in perfection when a man has ceased to think about his own person and has given up all designs of being a conqueror of ladies he was too young to be admitted as an equal amongst men who had made their mark in the world and of whose conversation he could scarcely as yet expect to be more than a listener <\s>
<s> and he was too old for the men of pleasure of his own age too much a man of pleasure for the men of business destinied in a word to be a good deal alone <\s>
<s> fate awards this lot of solitude to many a man and many like it from taste as many without difficulty bear it <\s>
<s> pendennis in reality suffered it very equanimously but in words and according to his wont grumbled over it not a little <\s>
<s> what a nice little artless creature that was mr <\s>
<s> pen thought at the very instant of waking after the vauxhall affair what a pretty natural manner she has how much pleasanter than the minauderies of the young ladies in the ballrooms and here he recalled to himself some instances of what he could not help seeing was the artful simplicity of miss blanche and some of the stupid graces of other young ladies in the polite world ); who could have thought that such a pretty rose could grow in a porter's lodge or bloom in that dismal old flower pot of a shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> so she learns to sing from old bows <\s>
<s> if her singing voice is as sweet as her speaking voice it must be pretty <\s>
<s> i like those low voilees voices <\s>
<s> what would you like me to call you <\s>
<s> indeed poor little fanny <\s>
<s> it went to my heart to adopt the grand air with her and tell her to call me sir <\s>
<s> but we'll have no nonsense of that sort no faust and margaret business for me <\s>
<s> so he teaches her to sing does he <\s>
<s> he's a dear old fellow old bows a gentleman in those old clothes a philosopher and with a kind heart too <\s>
<s> how good he was to me in the fotheringay business <\s>
<s> he too has had his griefs and his sorrows <\s>
<s> i must cultivate old bows <\s>
<s> a man ought to see people of all sorts <\s>
<s> i am getting tired of genteel society <\s>
<s> besides there's nobody in town <\s>
<s> yes i'll go and see bows and costigan too what a rich character <\s>
<s> begad i'll study him and put him into a book <\s>
<s> in this way our young anthropologist talked with himself and as saturday was the holiday of the week the pall mall gazette making its appearance upon that day and the contributors to that journal having no further calls upon their brains or ink bottles mr <\s>
<s> pendennis determined he would take advantage of his leisure and pay a visit to shepherd's inn of course to see old bows <\s>
<s> the truth is that if arthur had been the most determined roue and artful lovelace who ever set about deceiving a young girl he could hardly have adopted better means for fascinating and overcoming poor little fanny bolton than those which he had employed on the previous night <\s>
<s> his dandified protecting air his conceit generosity and good humour the very sense of good and honesty which had enabled him to check the tremulous advances of the young creature and not to take advantage of that little fluttering sensibility his faults and his virtues at once contributed to make her admire him and if we could peep into fanny's bed which she shared in a cupboard along with those two little sisters to whom we have seen mr <\s>
<s> costigan administering gingerbread and apples we should find the poor little maid tossing upon her mattress to the great disturbance of its other two occupants and thinking over all the delights and events of that delightful eventful night and all the words looks and actions of arthur its splendid hero <\s>
<s> many novels had fanny read in secret and at home in three volumes and in numbers <\s>
<s> periodical literature had not reached the height which it has attained subsequently and the girls of fanny's generation were not enabled to purchase sixteen pages of excitement for a penny rich with histories of crime murder oppressed virtue and the heartless seductions of the aristocracy but she had had the benefit of the circulating library which in conjunction with her school and a small brandy ball and millinery business miss minifer kept and arthur appeared to her at once as the type and realisation of all the heroes of all those darling greasy volumes which the young girl had devoured <\s>
<s> pen we have seen was rather a dandy about shirts and haberdashery in general <\s>
<s> fanny had looked with delight at the fineness of his linen at the brilliancy of his shirt studs at his elegant cambric pocket handkerchief and white gloves and at the jetty brightness of his charming boots <\s>
<s> the prince had appeared and subjugated the poor little handmaid <\s>
<s> his image traversed constantly her restless slumbers the tone of his voice the blue light of his eyes the generous look half love half pity the manly protecting smile the frank winning laughter all these were repeated in the girl's fond memory <\s>
<s> she felt still his arm encircling her and saw him smiling so grand as he filled up that delicious glass of champagne <\s>
<s> and then she thought of the girls her friends who used to sneer at her of emma baker who was so proud forsooth because she was engaged to a cheesemonger in a white apron near clare market and of betsy rodgers who make such a to do about her young man an attorney's clerk indeed that went about with a bag <\s>
<s> so that at about two o'clock in the afternoon the bolton family having concluded their dinner and mr <\s>
<s> b who besides his place of porter of the inn was in the employ of messrs <\s>
<s> tressler the eminent undertakers of the strand being absent in the country with the countess of estrich's hearse when a gentleman in a white hat and white trousers made his appearance under the inn archway and stopped at the porter's wicket fanny was not in the least surprised only delightful only happy and blushing beyond all measure <\s>
<s> she knew it could be no other than he <\s>
<s> she knew he'd come <\s>
<s> there he was there was his royal highness beaming upon her from the gate <\s>
<s> she called to her mother who was busy in the upper apartment mamma mamma and ran to the wicket at once and opened it pushing aside the other children <\s>
<s> how she blushed as she gave her hand to him <\s>
<s> how affably he took off his white hat as he came in the children staring up at him <\s>
<s> bolton if she had slept well after the fatigues of the night and hoped she had no headache and he said that as he was going that way he could not pass the door without asking news of his little partner <\s>
<s> bolton was perhaps rather shy and suspicious about these advances but mr <\s>
<s> pen's good humour was inexhaustible he could not see that he was unwelcome <\s>
<s> he looked about the premises for a seat and none being disengaged for a dish cover was on one a workbox on the other and so forth he took one of the children's chairs and perched himself upon that uncomfortable eminence <\s>
<s> at this the children began laughing the child fanny louder than all at least she was more amused than any of them and amazed at his royal highness's condescension <\s>
<s> he to sit down in that chair that little child's chair many and many a time after she regarded it haven't we almost all such furniture in our rooms that our fancy peoples with dear figures that our memory fills with sweet smiling faces which may never look on us more <\s>
<s> so pen sate down and talked away with great volubility to mrs <\s>
<s> he asked about the undertaking business and how many mutes went down with lady estrich's remains and about the inn and who lived there <\s>
<s> he seemed very much interested about mr <\s>
<s> campion's cab and horse and had met that gentleman in society <\s>
<s> he thought he should like shares in the polwheedle and tredyddlum did mrs <\s>
<s> bolton do for those chambers <\s>
<s> were there any chambers to let in the inn <\s>
<s> it was better than the temple he should like to come to live in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> as for captain strong and colonel altamont was his name <\s>
<s> he was deeply interested in them too <\s>
<s> the captain was an old friend at home <\s>
<s> he had dined with him at chambers here before the colonel came to live with him <\s>
<s> what sort of man was the colonel <\s>
<s> wasn't he a stout man with a large quantity of jewellery and a wig and large black whiskers very black here pen was immensely waggish and caused hysteric giggles of delight from the ladies very black indeed in fact blue black that is to say a rich greenish purple <\s>
<s> that was the man he had met him too at sir fr in society <\s>
<s> oh we know said the ladies sir f is sir f <\s>
<s> clavering he's often here two or three times a week with the captain <\s>
<s> my little boy has been out for bill stamps for him <\s>
<s> i beg pardon i shouldn't have mentioned no secrets mrs <\s>
<s> bolton blurted out being talked perfectly into good nature by this time <\s>
<s> but we know you to be a gentleman mr <\s>
<s> pendennis for i'm sure you have shown that you can beayve as such <\s>
<s> fanny loved her mother for that speech <\s>
<s> she cast up her dark eyes to the low ceiling and said oh that he has i'm sure ma with a voice full of feeling <\s>
<s> pen was rather curious about the bill stamps and concerning the transactions in strong's chambers <\s>
<s> and he asked when altamont came and joined the chevalier whether he too was out for bill stamps who he was whether he saw many people and so forth <\s>
<s> these questions put with considerable adroitness by pen who was interested about sir francis clavering's doings from private motives of his own were artlessly answered by mrs <\s>
<s> bolton and to the utmost of her knowledge and ability which in truth were not very great <\s>
<s> these questions answered and pen being at a loss for more luckily recollected his privilege as a member of the press and asked the ladies whether they would like any orders for the play <\s>
<s> the play was their delight as it is almost always the delight of every theatrical person <\s>
<s> when bolton was away professionally it appeared that of late the porter of shepherd's inn had taken a serious turn drank a good deal and otherwise made himself unpleasant to the ladies of his family they would like of all things to slip out and go to the theatre little barney their son keeping the lodge and mr <\s>
<s> pendennis's most generous and most genteel compliment of orders was received with boundless gratitude by both mother and daughter <\s>
<s> fanny clapped her hands with pleasure her faced beamed with it <\s>
<s> she looked and nodded and laughed at har mamma who nodded and laughed in her turn <\s>
<s> bolton was not superannuated for pleasure yet or by any means too old for admiration she thought <\s>
<s> and very likely mr <\s>
<s> pendennis in his conversation with her had insinuated some compliments or shaped his talk so as to please her <\s>
<s> at first against pen and suspicious of him she was his partisan now and almost as enthusiastic about him as her daughter <\s>
<s> when two women get together to like a man they help each other on each pushes the other forward and the second out of sheer sympathy becomes as eager as the principal at least so it is said by philosophers who have examined this science <\s>
<s> so the offer of the play tickets and other pleasantries put all parties into perfect good humour except for one brief moment when one of the younger children hearing the name of astley's pronounced came forward and stated that she should like very much to go too on which fanny said don't bother <\s>
<s> rather sharply and mamma said git long betsy jane do now and play in the court so that the two little ones namely betsy jane and ameliar ann went away in their little innocent pinafores and disported in the courtyard on the smooth gravel round about the statue of shepherd the great <\s>
<s> and here as they were playing they very possibly communicated with an old friend of theirs and dweller in the inn for while pen was making himself agreeable to the ladies at the lodge who were laughing delighted at his sallies an old gentleman passed under the archway from the inn square and came and looked in at the door of the lodge <\s>
<s> he made a very blank and rueful face when he saw mr <\s>
<s> arthur seated upon a table like macheath in the play in easy discourse with mrs <\s>
<s> bolton and her daughter <\s>
<s> how d'you do bows <\s>
<s> cried out pen in a cheery loud voice <\s>
<s> i was coming to see you and was asking your address of these ladies <\s>
<s> you were coming to see me were you sir <\s>
<s> bows said and came in with a sad face and shook hands with arthur <\s>
<s> plague on that old man <\s>
<s> somebody thought in the room and so perhaps some one else besides her <\s>
<s> in shepherd's inn our friend pen said how d'ye do mr <\s>
<s> bows in a loud cheery voice on perceiving that gentleman and saluted him in a dashing off hand manner yet you could have seen a blush upon arthur's face answered by fanny whose cheek straightway threw out a similar fluttering red signal ); and after bows and arthur had shaken hands and the former had ironically accepted the other's assertion that he was about to pay mr <\s>
<s> costigan's chambers a visit there was a gloomy and rather guilty silence in the company which pen presently tried to dispel by making a great rattling noise <\s>
<s> the silence of course departed at mr <\s>
<s> arthur's noise but the gloom remained and deepened as the darkness does in a vault if you light up a single taper in it <\s>
<s> pendennis tried to describe in a jocular manner the transactions of the previous night and attempted to give an imitation of costigan vainly expostulating with the check taker at vauxhall <\s>
<s> it was not a good imitation <\s>
<s> what stranger can imitate that perfection <\s>
<s> bolton did not in the least understand what part mr <\s>
<s> pendennis was performing and whether it was the check taker or the captain he was taking off <\s>
<s> fanny wore an alarmed face and tried a timid giggle old mr <\s>
<s> bows looked as glum as when he fiddled in the orchestra or played a difficult piece upon the old piano at the back kitchen <\s>
<s> pen felt that his story was a failure his voice sank and dwindled away dismally at the end of it flickered and went out and it was all dark again <\s>
<s> you could hear the ticket porter who lolls about shepherd's inn as he passed on the flags under the archway the clink of his boot heels was noted by everybody <\s>
<s> you were coming to see me sir mr <\s>
<s> won't you have the kindness to walk up to my chambers with me <\s>
<s> you do them a great honour i am sure <\s>
<s> they are rather high up but oh <\s>
<s> i live in a garret myself and shepherd's inn is twice as cheerful as lamb court mr <\s>
<s> i knew that you had third floor apartments mr <\s>
<s> bows said and was going to say you will please not take my remark as discourteous that the air up three pair of stairs is wholesomer for gentlemen than the air of a porter's lodge <\s>
<s> said pen whose candle flamed up again in his wrath and who was disposed to be as quarrelsome as men are when they are in the wrong <\s>
<s> will you permit me to choose my society without <\s>
<s> you were so polite as to say that you were about to honour my umble domicile with a visit mr <\s>
<s> bows said with his sad voice <\s>
<s> shall i show you the way <\s>
<s> pendennis and i are old friends mrs <\s>
<s> bolton very old acquaintances and at the earliest dawn of his life we crossed each other <\s>
<s> the old man pointed towards the door with a trembling finger and a hat in the other hand and in an attitude slightly theatrical so were his words when he spoke somewhat artificial and chosen from the vocabulary which he had heard all his life from the painted lips of the orators before the stage lamps <\s>
<s> but he was not acting or masquerading as pen knew very well though he was disposed to pooh pooh the old fellow's melodramatic airs <\s>
<s> come along sir he said as you are so very pressing <\s>
<s> bolton i wish you a good day <\s>
<s> good bye miss fanny i shall always think of our night at vauxhall with pleasure and be sure i will remember the theatre tickets <\s>
<s> and he took her hand pressed it was pressed by it and was gone <\s>
<s> what a nice young man to be sure <\s>
<s> d'you think so ma <\s>
<s> i was a thinkin who he was like <\s>
<s> when i was at the wells with mrs <\s>
<s> bolton continued looking through the window curtain after pen as he went up the court with bows there was a young gentleman from the city that used to come in a tilbry in a white at the very image of him only his whiskers was black and mr <\s>
<s> p s is red <\s>
<s> they are a most beautiful hawburn fanny said <\s>
<s> he used to come for emly budd who danced columbine in arleykin ornpipe or the battle of navarino when miss de la bosky was took ill a pretty dancer and a fine stage figure of a woman and he was a great sugar baker in the city with a country ouse at omerton and he used to drive her in the tilbry down goswell street road and one day they drove and was married at st <\s>
<s> bartholomew's church smithfield where they ad their bands read quite private and she now keeps her carriage and i sor her name in the paper as patroness of the manshing house ball for the washywomen's asylum <\s>
<s> and look at lady mirabel capting costigan's daughter she was profeshnl as all very well know <\s>
<s> thus and more to this purpose mrs <\s>
<s> bolton spoke now peeping through the window curtain now cleaning the mugs and plates and consigning them to their place in the corner cupboard and finishing her speech as she and fanny shook out and folded up the dinner cloth between them and restored it to its drawer in the table <\s>
<s> although costigan had once before been made pretty accurately to understand what pen's pecuniary means and expectations were i suppose cos had forgotten the information acquired at chatteris years ago or had been induced by his natural enthusiasm to exaggerate his friend's income <\s>
<s> he had described fairoaks park in the most glowing terms to mrs <\s>
<s> bolton on the preceding evening as he was walking about with her during pen's little escapade with fanny had dilated upon the enormous wealth of pen's famous uncle the major and shown an intimate acquaintance with arthur's funded and landed property <\s>
<s> bolton in her wisdom had speculated upon these matters during the night and had had visions of fanny driving in her carriage like mrs <\s>
<s> bolton's old comrade the dancer of sadler's wells <\s>
<s> in the last operation of table cloth folding these two foolish women of necessity came close together and as fanny took the cloth and gave it the last fold her mother put her finger under the young girl's chin and kissed her <\s>
<s> again the red signal flew out and fluttered on fanny's cheek <\s>
<s> what did it mean <\s>
<s> it was not alarm this time <\s>
<s> it was pleasure which caused the poor little fanny to blush so <\s>
<s> that it is so pleasant at the beginning and so bitter at the end <\s>
<s> after the embrace mrs <\s>

<s> bolton took her bonnet and market basket and departed and the instant she was gone fanny went and sae by the window which commanded bows's door and never once took her eyes away from that quarter of shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> betsy jane and ameliar ann were buzzing in one corner of the place and making believe to read out of a picture book which one of them held topsy turvy <\s>

<s> i don't know fanny said with an angry toss <\s>
<s> i don't follow ma's steps wherever she goes i suppose mr <\s>
<s> am i my mother's keeper <\s>
<s> bows said with his usual melancholy bitterness <\s>
<s> come here betsy jane and amelia ann i've brought a cake for the one who can read her letters best and a cake for the other who can read them the next best <\s>

<s> bows sate so that he could command the entrance from the lodge to the street <\s>
<s> but the person whom perhaps he expected to see never made his appearance again <\s>
<s> bolton came in from market and found mr <\s>
<s> bows in place of the person whom she had expected to see <\s>
<s> the reader perhaps can guess what was his name <\s>
<s> the interview between bows and his guest when those two mounted to the apartment occupied by the former in common with the descendant of the milesian kings was not particularly satisfactory to either party <\s>
<s> if bows had anything on his mind he did not care to deliver himself of his thoughts in the presence of captain costigan who remained in the apartment during the whole of pen's visit having quitted his bedchamber indeed but a very few minutes before the arrival of that gentleman <\s>

<s> lady mirabel wrote much better than miss fotheringay had been able to do <\s>
<s> her ladyship had laboured assiduously to acquire the art of penmanship since her marriage and in a common note of invitation or acceptance acquitted herself very genteelly <\s>

<s> he had but one specimen of the new style a note in reply to a song composed and dedicated to lady mirabel by her most humble servant robert bows and which document was treasured in his desk amongst his other state papers <\s>
<s> he was teaching fanny bolton now to sing and to write as he had taught emily in former days <\s>
<s> it was the nature of the man to attach himself to something <\s>

<s> there are people who in their youth have felt and inspired an heroic passion and end by being happy in the caresses or agitated by the illness of a poodle <\s>
<s> but it was hard upon bows and grating to his feelings as a man and a sentimentalist that he should find pen again upon his track and in pursuit of this little fanny <\s>
<s> meanwhile costigan had not the least idea but that his company was perfectly welcome to messrs <\s>
<s> pendennis and bows and that the visit of the former was intended for himself <\s>
<s> he expressed himself greatly pleased with that mark of poloightness and promised in his own mind that he would repay that obligation at least which was not the only debt which the captain owed in life by several visits to his young friend <\s>
<s> he entertained him affably with news of the day or rather of ten days previous for pen in his quality of journalist remembered to have seen some of the captain's opinions in the sporting and theatrical newspaper which was costigan's oracle <\s>
<s> he stated that sir charles and lady mirabel were gone to baden baden and were most pressing in their invitations that he should join them there <\s>
<s> pen replied with great gravity that he had heard that baden was very pleasant and the grand duke exceedingly hospitable to english <\s>
<s> costigan answered that the laws of hospitalitee bekeam a grand juke that he sariously would think about visiting him and made some remarks upon the splendid festivities at dublin castle when his excellency the earl of portansherry held the viceraygal coort there and of which he costigan had been a humble but pleased spectator <\s>
<s> and pen as he heard these oft told well remembered legends recollected the time when he had given a sort of credence to them and had a certain respect for the captain <\s>
<s> emily and first love and the little room at chatteris and the kind talk with bows on the bridge came back to him <\s>
<s> he felt quite kindly disposed towards his two old friends and cordially shook the hands of both of them when he rose to go away <\s>
<s> he had quite forgotten about little fanny bolton whilst the captain was talking and pen himself was absorbed in other selfish meditations <\s>

<s> confound him what does he mean by dogging me <\s>
<s> and he burst out laughing when he was in the strand and by himself as he thought of the elder's stratagem <\s>
<s> it was not an honest laugh arthur pendennis <\s>
<s> perhaps the thought struck arthur himself and he blushed at his own sense of humour <\s>
<s> he went off to endeavour to banish the thoughts which occupied him whatever those thoughts might be and tried various places of amusement with but indifferent success <\s>
<s> he struggled up the highest stairs of the panorama but when he had arrived panting at the height of the eminence care had come up with him and was bearing him company <\s>
<s> he went to the club and wrote a long letter home exceedingly witty and sarcastic and in which if he did not say a single word about vauxhall and fanny bolton it was because he thought that subject however interesting to himself would not be very interesting to his mother and laura <\s>
<s> nor could the novels or the library table fix his attention nor the grave and respectable jawkins the only man in town who wished to engage him in conversation nor any of the amusements which he tried after flying from jawkins <\s>
<s> he passed a comic theatre on his way home and saw stunning farce roars of laughter good old english fun and frolic placarded in vermilion letters on the gate <\s>
<s> he went into the pit and saw the lovely mrs <\s>
<s> leary as usual in a man's attire and that eminent buffo actor tom horseman dressed as a woman <\s>
<s> horseman's travesty seemed to him a horrid and hideous degradation mrs <\s>
<s> leary's glances and ankles had not the least effect <\s>
<s> he laughed again and bitterly to himself as he thought of the effect which she had produced upon him on the first night of his arrival in london a short time what a long long time ago <\s>
<s> or near the temple garden fashion has long deserted the green and pretty temple garden which in shakespeare makes york and lancaster to pluck the innocent white and red roses which became the badges of their bloody wars and the learned and pleasant writer of the handbook of london tells us that the commonest and hardiest kind of rose has long ceased to put forth a bud in that smoky air <\s>

<s> arthur pendennis was of a romantic and literary turn by no means addicted to the legal pursuits common in the neighbourhood of the place we may presume that he was cherishing some such poetical reflections as these when upon the evening after the events recorded in the last chapter the young gentleman chose the temple gardens as a place for exercise and meditation <\s>
<s> on the sunday evening the temple is commonly calm <\s>
<s> the chambers are for the most part vacant the great lawyers are giving grand dinner parties at their houses in the belgravian or tyburnian districts the agreeable young barristers are absent attending those parties and paying their respects to mr <\s>
<s> kewsy's excellent claret or mr <\s>
<s> justice ermine's accomplished daughters the uninvited are partaking of the economic joint and the modest half pint of wine at the club entertaining themselves and the rest of the company in the club room with circuit jokes and points of wit and law <\s>
<s> nobody is in chambers at all except poor mr <\s>
<s> cockle who is ill and whose laundress is making him gruel or mr <\s>
<s> toodle who is an amateur of the flute and whom you may hear piping solitary from his chambers in the second floor or young tiger the student from whose open windows comes a great gush of cigar smoke and at whose door are a quantity of dishes and covers bearing the insignia of dicks or the cock <\s>
<s> whither does fancy lead us <\s>
<s> it is vacation time and with the exception of pendennis nobody is in chambers at all <\s>
<s> perhaps it was solitude then which drove pen into the garden for although he had never before passed the gate and had looked rather carelessly at the pretty flower beds and the groups of pleased citizens sauntering over the trim lawn and the broad gravel walks by the river on this evening it happened as we have said that the young gentleman who had dined alone at a tavern in the neighbourhood of the temple took a fancy as he was returning home to his chambers to take a little walk in the gardens and enjoy the fresh evening air and the sight of the shining thames <\s>
<s> after walking for a brief space and looking at the many peaceful and happy groups round about him he grew tired of the exercise and betook himself to one of the summer houses which flank either end of the main walk and there modestly seated himself <\s>
<s> what were his cogitations <\s>
<s> the evening was delightfully bright and calm the sky was cloudless the chimneys on the opposite bank were not smoking the wharfs warehouses looked rosy in the sunshine and as clear as if they too had washed for the holiday <\s>
<s> the steamers rushed rapidly up and down the stream laden with holiday passengers <\s>
<s> the bells of the multitudinous city churches were ringing to evening prayers such peaceful sabbath evenings as this pen may have remembered in his early days as he paced with his arm round his mother's waist on the terrace before the lawn at home <\s>
<s> the sun was lighting up the little brawl too as well as the broad thames and sinking downwards majestically behind the clavering elms and the tower of the familiar village church <\s>
<s> was it thoughts of these or the sunset merely that caused the blush in the young man's face <\s>
<s> he beat time on the bench to the chorus of the bells without flicked the dust off his shining boots with his pocket handkerchief and starting up stamped with his foot and said no by jove i'll go home <\s>
<s> and with this resolution which indicated that some struggle as to the propriety of remaining where he was or of quitting the garden had been going on in his mind he stepped out of the summer house <\s>
<s> he nearly knocked down two little children who did not indeed reach much higher than his knee and were trotting along the gravel walk with their long blue shadows slanting towards the east <\s>
<s> one cried out oh <\s>
<s> the other began to laugh and with a knowing little infantile chuckle said missa pendennis <\s>
<s> and arthur looking down saw his two little friends of the day before mesdemoiselles ameliar ann and betsy jane <\s>
<s> he blushed more than ever at seeing them and seizing the one whom he had nearly upset jumped her up into the air and kissed her at which sudden assault ameliar ann began to cry in great alarm <\s>
<s> this cry brought up instantly two ladies in clean collars and new ribbons and grand shawls namely mrs <\s>
<s> bolton in a rich scarlet caledonian cashmere and a black silk dress and miss f <\s>
<s> bolton with a yellow scarf and a sweet sprigged muslin and a parasol quite the lady <\s>
<s> fanny did not say one single word though her eyes flashed a welcome and shone as bright as bright as the most blazing windows in paper buildings <\s>
<s> bolton after admonishing betsy jane said lor sir how very odd that we should meet you year <\s>
<s> i ope you ave your ealth well sir ain't it odd fanny that we should meet mr <\s>
<s> what do you mean by sniggering mesdames <\s>
<s> when young croesus has been staying at a country house have you never by any singular coincidence been walking with your fanny in the shrubberies <\s>
<s> have you and your fanny never happened to be listening to the band of the heavies at brighton when young de boots and captain padmore came clinking down the pier <\s>
<s> have you and your darling frances never chanced to be visiting old widow wheezy at the cottage on the common when the young curate has stepped in with a tract adapted to the rheumatism <\s>
<s> do you suppose that if singular coincidences occur at the hall they don't also happen at the lodge <\s>
<s> it was a coincidence no doubt that was all <\s>
<s> in the course of the conversation on the day previous mr <\s>
<s> pendennis had merely said in the simplest way imaginable and in reply to a question of miss bolton that although some of the courts were gloomy parts of the temple were very cheerful and agreeable especially the chambers looking on the river and around the gardens and that the gardens were a very pleasant walk on sunday evenings and frequented by a great number of people and here by the merest chance all our acquaintances met together just like so many people in genteel life <\s>
<s> what could be more artless good natured or natural <\s>
<s> pen looked very grave pompous and dandified <\s>
<s> he was unusually smart and brilliant in his costume <\s>
<s> his white duck trousers and white hat his neckcloth of many colours his light waistcoat gold chains and shirt studs gave him the air of a prince of the blood at least <\s>
<s> how his splendour became his figure <\s>
<s> was anybody ever like him <\s>
<s> he blushed how his blushes became him <\s>
<s> the same individual said to herself <\s>
<s> the children on seeing him the day before had been so struck with him that after he had gone away they had been playing at him <\s>
<s> and ameliar ann sticking her little chubby fingers into the arm holes of her pinafore as pen was wont to do with his waistcoat had said now bessy jane i'll be missa pendennis <\s>
<s> fanny had laughed till she cried and smothered her sister with kisses for that feat <\s>
<s> how happy too she was to see arthur embracing the child <\s>
<s> if arthur was red fanny on the contrary was very worn and pale <\s>
<s> arthur remarked it and asked kindly why she looked so fatigued <\s>
<s> i was awake all night said fanny and began to blush a little <\s>
<s> i put out her candle and hordered her to go to sleep and leave off readin interposed the fond mother <\s>
<s> and what was it that interested you so <\s>
<s> oh it's so beautiful <\s>
<s> walter lorraine fanny sighed out <\s>
<s> how i do hate that neaera neaera i don't know the pronunciation <\s>
<s> and i love leonora and walter oh how dear he is <\s>
<s> how had fanny discovered the novel of walter lorraine and that pen was the author <\s>
<s> this little person remembered every single word which mr <\s>
<s> pendennis had spoken on the night previous and how he wrote in books and newspapers <\s>
<s> she was so eager to know that she had almost a mind to be civil to old bows who was suffering under her displeasure since yesterday but she determined first to make application to costigan <\s>
<s> she began by coaxing the captain and smiling upon him in her most winning way as she helped to arrange his dinner and set his humble apartment in order <\s>
<s> she was sure his linen wanted mending and indeed the captain's linen closet contained some curious specimens of manufactured flax and cotton <\s>
<s> she would mend his shirts all his shirts <\s>
<s> what horrid holes what funny holes <\s>
<s> she put her little face through one of them and laughed at the old warrior in the most winning manner <\s>
<s> she would have made a funny little picture looking through the holes <\s>
<s> then she daintily removed costigan's dinner things tripping about the room as she had seen the dancers do at the play and she danced to the captain's cupboard and produced his whisky bottle and mixed him a tumbler and must taste a drop of it a little drop and the captain must sing her one of his songs his dear songs and teach it to her <\s>
<s> and when he had sung an irish melody in his rich quavering voice fancying it was he who was fascinating the little siren she put her little question about arthur pendennis and his novel and having got an answer cared for nothing more but left the captain at the piano about to sing her another song and the dinner tray on the passage and the shirts on the chair and ran downstairs quickening her pace as she sped <\s>
<s> captain costigan as he said was not a litherary cyarkter nor had he as yet found time to peruse his young friend's ellygant perfaurumance though he intended to teak an early opporchunitee of purchasing a cawpee of his work <\s>
<s> but he knew the name of pen's novel from the fact that messrs <\s>
<s> finucane bludyer and other frequenters of the back kitchen spoke of mr <\s>
<s> pendennis and not all of them with great friendship for bludyer called him a confounded coxcomb and hoolan wondered that doolan did not kick him etc by the sobriquet of walter lorraine and was hence enabled to give fanny the information which she required <\s>
<s> and she went and ast for it at the libery mrs <\s>
<s> bolton said several liberies and some ad it and it was bout and some adn't it <\s>
<s> and one of the liberies as ad it wouldn't let er ave it without a sovering and she adn't one and she came back a cryin to me didn't you fanny and i gave her a sovering <\s>
<s> and oh i was in such a fright lest any one should have come to the libery and took it while i was away fanny said her cheeks and eyes glowing <\s>
<s> and oh i do like it so <\s>
<s> arthur was touched by this artless sympathy immensely flattered and moved by it <\s>
<s> do you like it <\s>
<s> if you will come up to my chambers i will no i will bring you one no i will send you one <\s>
<s> i mustn't stay with you <\s>
<s> and pressing her hand once and nodding to her mother and the other children he strode out of the gardens <\s>
<s> he quickened his pace as he went from them and ran out of the gate talking to himself <\s>
<s> dear dear little thing he said darling little fanny <\s>
<s> you are worth them all <\s>
<s> i wish to heaven shandon was back <\s>
<s> i'd go home to my mother <\s>
<s> i mustn't see her <\s>
<s> i won't so help me as he was talking thus and running the passers by turning to look at him he ran against a little old man and perceived it was mr <\s>
<s> your very umble servant sir said mr <\s>
<s> bows making a sarcastic bow and lifting his old hat from his forehead <\s>
<s> i wish you a good day arthur answered sulkily <\s>
<s> don't let me detain you or give you the trouble to follow me again <\s>
<s> i am in a hurry sir <\s>
<s> bows thought pen had some reason for hurrying to his rooms <\s>
<s> exclaimed the old gentleman <\s>
<s> you know whom i mean <\s>
<s> they're not in your rooms sir are they <\s>
<s> they told bolton they were going to church at the temple they weren't there <\s>
<s> they are in your chambers they mustn't stay in your chambers mr <\s>
<s> cried out pendennis fiercely <\s>
<s> come and see if they are in my chambers here's the court and the door come in and see <\s>
<s> and bows taking off his hat and bowing first followed the young man <\s>
<s> they were not in pen's chambers as we know <\s>
<s> but when the gardens were closed the two women who had r had but a melancholy evening's amusement walked away sadly with the children and they entered into lamb court and stood under the lamp post which cheerfully ornaments the centre of that quadrangle and looked up to the third floor of the house where pendennis's chambers were and where they saw a light presently kindled <\s>
<s> then this couple of fools went away the children dragging wearily after them and returned to mr <\s>
<s> bolton who was immersed in rum and water at his lodge in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> bows looked round the blank room which the young man occupied and which had received but very few ornaments or additions since the last time we saw them <\s>
<s> warrington's old bookcase and battered library pen's writing table with its litter of papers presented an aspect cheerless enough <\s>
<s> will you like to look in the bedrooms mr <\s>
<s> bows and see if my victims are there <\s>
<s> he said bitterly or whether i have made away with the little girls and hid them in the coal hole <\s>
<s> your word is sufficient mr <\s>
<s> pendennis the other said in his sad tone <\s>
<s> you say they are not here and i know they are not <\s>
<s> and i hope they never have been here and never will come <\s>
<s> upon my word sir you are very good to choose my acquaintances for me arthur said in a haughty tone and to suppose that anybody would be the worse for my society <\s>
<s> i remember you and owe you kindness from old times mr <\s>
<s> bows or i should speak more angrily than i do about a very intolerable sort of persecution to which you seem inclined to subject me <\s>
<s> you followed me out of your inn yesterday as if you wanted to watch that i shouldn't steal something <\s>
<s> here pen stammered and turned red directly he had said the words he felt he had given the other an opening which bows instantly took <\s>
<s> i do think you came to steal something as you say the words sir bows said <\s>
<s> do you mean to say that you came to pay a visit to poor old bows the fiddler or to mrs <\s>
<s> bolton at the porter's lodge <\s>
<s> such a fine gentleman as arthur pendennis esquire doesn't condescend to walk up to my garret or to sit in a laundress's kitchen but for reasons of his own <\s>
<s> and my belief is that you came to steal a pretty girl's heart away and to ruin it and to spurn it afterwards mr <\s>
<s> that's what the world makes of you young dandies you gentlemen of fashion you high and mighty aristocrats that trample upon the people <\s>
<s> it's sport to you but what is it to the poor think you the toys of your pleasures whom you play with and whom you fling into the streets when you are tired <\s>
<s> i know your order sir <\s>
<s> i know your selfishness and your arrogance and your pride <\s>
<s> what does it matter to my lord that the poor man's daughter is made miserable and her family brought to shame <\s>
<s> you must have your pleasures and the people of course must pay for them <\s>
<s> what are we made for but for that <\s>
<s> it's the way with you all the way with you all sir <\s>
<s> bows was speaking beside the question and pen had his advantage here which he was not sorry to take not sorry to put off the debate from the point upon which his adversary had first engaged it <\s>
<s> arthur broke out with a sort of laugh for which he asked bows's pardon <\s>
<s> yes i am an aristocrat he said in a palace up three pair of stairs with a carpet nearly as handsome as yours mr <\s>
<s> my life is passed in grinding the people is it in ruining virgins and robbing the poor <\s>
<s> my good sir this is very well in a comedy where job thornberry slaps his breast and asks my lord how dare he trample on an honest man and poke out an englishman's fireside but in real life mr <\s>
<s> bows to a man who has to work for his bread as much as you do how can you talk about aristocrats tyrannising over the people <\s>
<s> have i ever done you a wrong <\s>
<s> or assumed airs of superiority over you <\s>
<s> did you not have an early regard for me in days when we were both of us romantic young fellows mr <\s>
<s> come don't be angry with me now and let us be as good friends as we were before <\s>
<s> those days were very different mr <\s>
<s> bows answered and mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis was an honest impetuous young fellow then rather selfish and conceited perhaps but honest <\s>
<s> he liked you then because you were ready to ruin yourself for a woman <\s>
<s> and now times are changed and you want a woman to ruin herself for you bows answered <\s>
<s> i know this child sir <\s>
<s> i've always said this lot was hanging over her <\s>
<s> she has heated her little brain with novels until her whole thoughts are about love and lovers and she scarcely sees that she treads on a kitchen floor <\s>
<s> i have taught the little thing <\s>
<s> she is full of many talents and winning ways i grant you <\s>
<s> i am fond of the girl sir <\s>
<s> i'm a lonely old man i lead a life that i don't like among boon companions who make me melancholy <\s>
<s> i have but this child that i care for <\s>
<s> have pity upon me and don't take her away from me mr <\s>
<s> pendennis don't take her away <\s>
<s> the old man's voice broke as he spoke <\s>
<s> its accents touched pen much more than the menacing or sarcastic tone which bows had commenced by adopting <\s>
<s> indeed said he kindly you do me a wrong if you fancy i intend one to poor little fanny <\s>
<s> i never saw her till friday night <\s>
<s> it was the merest chance that our friend costigan threw her into my way <\s>
<s> i have no intentions regarding her that is that is you know very well that she is a foolish girl and her mother a foolish woman that is you meet her in the temple gardens and of course without previous concert that is that when i found her yesterday reading the book you've wrote she scorned me bows said <\s>
<s> what am i good for but to be laughed at <\s>
<s> a deformed old fellow like me an old fiddler that wears a threadbare coat and gets his bread by playing tunes at an ale house <\s>
<s> you are a fine gentleman you are <\s>
<s> you wear scent in your handkerchief and a ring on your finger <\s>
<s> you go to dine with great people <\s>
<s> who ever gives a crust to old bows <\s>
<s> and yet i might have been as good a man as the best of you <\s>
<s> i might have been a man of genius if i had had the chance ay and have lived with the master spirits of the land <\s>
<s> but everything hads ailed with me <\s>
<s> i'd ambition once and wrote plays poems music nobody would give me a hearing <\s>
<s> i never loved a woman but she laughed at me and here i am in my old age alone alone <\s>
<s> don't take this girl from me mr <\s>
<s> pendennis i say again <\s>
<s> leave her with me a little longer <\s>
<s> she was like a child to me till yesterday <\s>
<s> why did you step in and made her to mock my deformity and old age <\s>
<s> i am guiltless of that at least arthur said with something of a sigh <\s>
<s> upon my word of honour i wish i had never seen the girl <\s>
<s> my calling is not seduction mr <\s>
<s> i did not imagine that i had made an impression on poor fanny until until to night <\s>
<s> and then sir i was sorry and was flying from my temptation as you came upon me <\s>
<s> and he added with a glow upon his cheek which in the gathering darkness his companion could not see and with an audible tremor in his voice i do not mind telling you sir that on this sabbath evening as the church bells were ringing i thought of my own home and of women angelically pure and good who dwell there and i was running hither as i met you that i might avoid the danger which beset me and ask strength of god almighty to do my duty <\s>
<s> after these words from arthur a silence ensued and when the conversation was resumed by his guest the latter spoke in a tone which was much more gentle and friendly <\s>
<s> and on taking farewell of pen bows asked leave to shake hands with him and with a very warm and affectionate greeting on both sides apologised to arthur for having mistaken him and paid him some compliments which caused the young man to squeeze his old friend's hand heartily again <\s>
<s> and as they parted at pen's door arthur said he had given a promise and he hoped and trusted that mr <\s>
<s> bows might rely on it <\s>
<s> amen to that prayer said mr <\s>
<s> bows and went slowly down the stair <\s>
<s> the happy village again early in this history we have had occasion to speak of the little town of clavering near which pen's paternal home of fairoaks stood and of some of the people who inhabite the place and as the society there was by no means amusing or pleasant our reports concerning it were not carried to any very great length <\s>
<s> samuel huxter the gentleman whose acquaintance we lately made at vauxhall was one of the choice spirits of the little town when he visited it during his vacation and enlivened the tables of his friends there by the wit of bartholomew's and the gossip of the fashionable london circles which he frequented <\s>
<s> hobnell the young gentleman whom pen had thrashed in consequence of the quarrel in the fotheringay affair was whilst a pupil at the grammar school at clavering made very welcome at the tea table of mrs <\s>
<s> huxter samuel's mother and was free of the surgery where he knew the way to the tamarind pots and could scent his pocket handkerchief with rose water <\s>
<s> and it was at this period of his life that he formed an attachment for miss sophy huxter whom on his father's demise he married and took home to his house of the warren at a few miles from clavering <\s>
<s> the family had possessed and cultivated an estate there for many years as yeomen and farmers <\s>

<s> hobnell in the country of which mr <\s>

<s> sam described arthur's pursuits in london and his confounded insolence of behaviour to his old friends from home <\s>
<s> he said he was an abandoned criminal a regular don juan a fellow who when he did come into the country ought to be kept out of honest people's houses <\s>
<s> he had seen him at vauxhall dancing with an innocent girl in the lower ranks of life of whom he was making a victim <\s>
<s> he had found out from an irish gentleman formerly in the army who frequented a club of which he huxter was member who the girl was on whom this conceited humbug was practising his infernal arts and he thought he should warn her father etc <\s>
<s> etc the letter then touched on general news conveyed the writer's thanks for the last parcel and the rabbits and hinted his extreme readiness for further favours <\s>
<s> about once a year as we have stated there was occasion for a christening at the warren and it happened that this ceremony took place a day after hobnell had received the letter of his brother in law in town <\s>
<s> the infant a darling little girl was christened myra lucretia after its two godmothers miss portman and mrs <\s>
<s> pybus of clavering and as of course hobnell had communicated sam's letter to his wife mrs <\s>
<s> hobnell imparted its horrid contents to her two gossips <\s>
<s> a pretty story it was and prettily it was told throughout clavering in the course of that day <\s>
<s> myra did not she was too much shocked to do so speak on the matter to her mamma but mrs <\s>
<s> pybus had no such feelings of reserve <\s>
<s> she talked over the matter not only with mrs <\s>
<s> portman but with mr <\s>
<s> and the honourable mrs <\s>
<s> glanders her daughters being to that end ordered out of the room with madame fribsby and in a word with the whole of the clavering society <\s>
<s> madame fribsby looking furtively up at her picture of the dragoon and inwards into her own wounded memory said that men would be men and as long as they were men would be deceivers and she pensively quoted some lines from marmion requesting to know where deceiving lovers should rest <\s>
<s> pybus had no words of hatred horror contempt strong enough for a villain who could be capable of conduct so base <\s>
<s> this was what came of early indulgence and insolence and extravagance and aristocratic airs it is certain that pen had refused to drink tea with mrs <\s>
<s> pybus and attending the corrupt and horrid parties in the dreadful modern babylon <\s>
<s> portman was afraid that she must acknowledge that the mother's fatal partiality had spoiled this boy that his literary successes had turned his head and his horrid passions had made him forget the principles which doctor portman had instilled into him in early life <\s>
<s> glanders the atrocious captain of dragoons when informed of the occurrence by mrs <\s>
<s> glanders whistled and made jocular allusions to it at dinner time on which mrs <\s>
<s> glanders called him a brute and ordered the girls again out of the room as the horrid captain burst out laughing <\s>
<s> simcoe was calm under the intelligence but rather pleased than otherwise it only served to confirm the opinion which he had always had of that wretched young man not that he knew anything about him not that he had read one line of his dangerous and poisonous works heaven forbid that he should but what could be expected from such a youth and such frightful such lamentable such deplorable want of seriousness <\s>
<s> pen formed the subject for a second sermon at the clavering chapel of ease where the dangers of london and the crime of reading or writing novels were pointed out on a sunday evening to a large and warm congregation <\s>
<s> they did not wait to hear whether he was guilty or not <\s>
<s> they took his wickedness for granted and with these admirable moralists it was who should fling the stone at poor pen <\s>
<s> the next day mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis alone and almost fainting with emotion and fatigue walked or rather ran to dr <\s>
<s> portman's house to consult the good doctor <\s>
<s> she had had an anonymous letter some christian had thought it his or her duty to stab the good soul who had never done mortal a wrong an anonymous letter with references to scripture pointing out the doom of such sinners and a detailed account of pen's crime <\s>
<s> she was in a state of terror and excitement pitiable to witness <\s>
<s> two or three hours of this pain had aged her already <\s>
<s> in her first moment of agitation she had dropped the letter and laura had read it <\s>
<s> laura blushed when she read it her whole frame trembled but it was with anger <\s>
<s> the cowards she said it isn't true no mother it isn't true <\s>
<s> it is true and you've done it laura cried out helen fiercely <\s>
<s> why did you refuse him when he asked you <\s>
<s> why did you break my heart and refuse him <\s>
<s> it is you who led him into crime <\s>
<s> it is you who flung him into the arms of this this woman don't speak to me don't answer me <\s>
<s> i will never forgive you never <\s>
<s> martha bring me my bonnet and shawl <\s>
<s> i won't have you come with me <\s>
<s> leave me cruel girl why have you brought this shame on me <\s>
<s> and bidding her daughter and her servants keep away from her she ran down the road to clavering <\s>
<s> doctor portman glancing over the letter thought he knew the handwriting and of course was already acquainted with the charge made against poor pen <\s>
<s> against his own conscience perhaps for the worthy doctor like most of us had a considerable natural aptitude for receiving any report unfavourable to his neighbours he strove to console helen he pointed out that the slander came from an anonymous quarter and therefore must be the work of a rascal that the charge might not be true was not true most likely at least that pen must be heard before he was condemned that the son of such a mother was not likely to commit such a crime etc <\s>
<s> helen at once saw through his feint of objection and denial <\s>
<s> you think he has done it she said you know you think he has done it <\s>
<s> oh why did i ever leave him doctor portman or suffer him away from me <\s>
<s> but he can't be dishonest pray god not dishonest you don't think that do you <\s>
<s> remember his conduct about that other person how madly he was attached to her <\s>
<s> he was an honest boy then he is now <\s>
<s> and i thank god yes i fall down on my knees and thank god he paid laura <\s>
<s> you said he was good you did yourself <\s>
<s> and now if this woman loves him and you know they must if he has taken her from her home or she tempted him which is most likely why still she must be his wife and my daughter <\s>
<s> and he must leave the dreadful world and come back to me to his mother doctor portman <\s>
<s> let us go away and bring him back yes bring him back and there shall be joy for the the sinner that repenteth <\s>
<s> let us go now directly dear friend this very helen could say no more <\s>
<s> she fell back and fainted <\s>
<s> she was carried to a bed in the house of the pitying doctor and the surgeon was called to attend her <\s>
<s> she lay all night in an alarming state <\s>
<s> laura came to her or to the rectory rather for she would not see laura <\s>
<s> and doctor portman still beseeching her to be tranquil and growing bolder and more confident of arthur's innocence as he witnessed the terrible grief of the poor mother wrote a letter to pen warning him of the rumours that were against him and earnestly praying that he would break off and repent of a connexion so fatal to his best interests and his soul's welfare <\s>
<s> and laura was her heart not wrung by the thought of arthur's crime and helen's estrangement <\s>
<s> was it not a bitter blow for the innocent girl to think that at one stroke she should lose all the love which she cared for in the world <\s>
<s> which had very nearly been the last of the story doctor portman's letter was sent off to its destination in london and the worthy clergyman endeavoured to soothe down mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis into some state of composure until an answer should arrive which the doctor tried to think or at any rate persisted in saying would be satisfactory as regarded the morality of mr <\s>
<s> at least helen's wisdom of moving upon london and appearing in person to warn her son of his wickedness was impracticable for a day or two <\s>
<s> the apothecary forbade her moving even so far as fairoaks for the first day and it was not until the subsequent morning that she found herself again back on her sofa at home with the faithful though silent laura nursing at her side <\s>
<s> unluckily for himself and all parties pen never read that homily which doctor portman addressed to him until many weeks after the epistle had been composed and day after day the widow waited for her son's reply to the charges against him her own illness increasing with every day's delay <\s>
<s> it was a hard task for laura to bear the anxiety to witness her dearest friend's suffering worst of all to support helen's estrangement and the pain caused to her by that averted affection <\s>
<s> but it was the custom of this young lady to the utmost of her power and by means of that gracious assistance which heaven awarded to her pure and constant prayers to do her duty <\s>
<s> and as that duty was performed quite noiselessly while the supplications which endowed her with the requisite strength for fulfilling it also took place in her own chamber away from all mortal sight we too must be perforce silent about these virtues of hers which no more bear public talking about than a flower will bear to bloom in a ballroom <\s>
<s> this only we will say that a good woman is the loveliest flower that blooms under heaven and that we look with love and wonder upon its silent grace its pure fragrance its delicate bloom of beauty <\s>
<s> sweet and beautiful the fairest and the most spotless is it not pity to see them bowed down or devoured by grief or death inexorable wasting in disease pining with long pain or cut off by sudden fate in their prime <\s>
<s> we may deserve grief but why should these be unhappy except that we know that heaven chastens those whom it loves best being pleased by repeated trials to make these pure spirits more pure <\s>
<s> so pen never got the letter although it was duly posted and faithfully discharged by the postman into his letter box in lamb court and thence carried by the laundress to his writing table with the rest of his lordship's correspondence into which room have we not seen a picture of him entering from his little bedroom adjoining as mrs <\s>
<s> flanagan his laundress was in the act of drinking his gin <\s>
<s> those kind readers who have watched mr <\s>
<s> arthur's career hitherto and have made as they naturally would do observations upon the moral character and peculiarities of their acquaintance have probably discovered by this time what was the prevailing fault in mr <\s>
<s> pen's disposition and who was that greatest enemy artfully indicated in the title page with whom he had to contend <\s>
<s> not a few of us my beloved public have the very same rascal to contend with a scoundrel who takes every opportunity of bringing us into mischief of plunging us into quarrels of leading us into idleness and unprofitable company and what not <\s>
<s> in a word pen's greatest enemy was himself and as he had been pampering and coaxing and indulging that individual all his life the rogue grew insolent as all spoiled servants will be and at the slightest attempt to coerce him or make him do that which was unpleasant to him became frantically rude and unruly <\s>
<s> a person who is used to making sacrifices laura for instance who had got such a habit of giving up her own pleasure for others can do the business quite easily but pen unaccustomed as he was to any sort of self denial suffered woundily when called on to pay his share and savagely grumbled at being obliged to forgo anything he liked <\s>
<s> he had resolved in his mighty mind then that he would not see fanny and he wouldn't <\s>
<s> he tried to drive the thoughts of that fascinating little person out of his head by constant occupation by exercise by dissipation and society <\s>
<s> he worked then too much he walked and rode too much he ate drank and smoked too much nor could all the cigars and the punch of which he partook drive little fanny's image out of his inflamed brain and at the end of a week of this discipline and self denial our young gentleman was in bed with a fever <\s>
<s> let the reader who has never had a fever in chambers pity the wretch who is bound to undergo that calamity <\s>
<s> a committee of marriageable ladies or of any christian persons interested in the propagation of the domestic virtues should employ a cruikshank or a leech or some other kindly expositor of the follies of the day to make a series of designs representing the horrors of a bachelor's life in chambers and leading the beholder to think of better things and a more wholesome condition <\s>
<s> what can be more uncomfortable than the bachelor's lonely breakfast with the black kettle in the dreary fire in midsummer or worse still with the fire gone out at christmas half an hour after the laundress has quitted the sitting room <\s>
<s> into this solitude the owner enters shivering and has to commence his day by hunting for coals and wood and before he begins the work of a student has to discharge the duties of a housemaid vice mrs <\s>
<s> flanagan who is absent without leave <\s>
<s> or again what can form a finer subject for the classical designer than the bachelor's shirt that garment which he wants to assume just at dinner time and which he finds without any buttons to fasten it <\s>
<s> then there is the bachelor's return to chambers after a merry christmas holiday spent in a cosy country house full of pretty faces and kind welcomes and regrets <\s>
<s> he leaves his portmanteau at the barber's in the court he lights his dismal old candle at the sputtering little lamp on the stair he enters the blank familiar room where the only tokens to greet him that show any interest in his personal welfare are the christmas bills which are lying in wait for him amiably spread out on his reading table <\s>
<s> add to these scenes an appalling picture of bachelor's illness and the rents in the temple will begin to fall from the day of the publication of the dismal diorama <\s>
<s> to be well in chambers is melancholy and lonely and selfish enough but to be ill in chambers to pass long nights of pain and watchfulness to long for the morning and the laundress to serve yourself your own medicine by your own watch to have no other companion for long hours but your own sickening fancies and fevered thoughts no kind hand to give you drink if you are thirsty or to smooth the hot pillow that crumples under you this indeed is a fate so dismal and tragic that we shall not enlarge upon its horrors and shall only heartily pity those bachelors in the temple who brave it every day <\s>
<s> this lot befell arthur pendennis after the various excesses which we have mentioned and to which he had subjected his unfortunate brains <\s>
<s> one night he went to bed ill and the next day awoke worse <\s>
<s> his only visitor that day besides the laundress was the printer's devil from the pall mall gazette office whom the writer endeavoured as best he could to satisfy <\s>
<s> his exertions to complete his work rendered his fever the greater he could only furnish a part of the quantity of copy usually supplied by him and shandon being absent and warrington not in london to give a help the political and editorial columns of the gazette looked very blank indeed nor did the sub editor know how to fill them <\s>
<s> finucane rushed up to pen's chambers and found that gentleman so exceedingly unwell that the good natured irishman set to work to supply his place if possible and produced a series of political and critical compositions such as no doubt greatly edified the readers of the periodical in which he and pen were concerned <\s>
<s> allusions to the greatness of ireland and the genius and virtue of the inhabitants of that injured country flowed magnificently from finucane's pen and shandon the chief of the paper who was enjoying himself placidly at boulogne sur mer looking over the columns of the journal which was forwarded to him instantly recognised the hand of the great sub editor and said laughing as he flung over the paper to his wife look here mary my dear here is jack at work again <\s>
<s> indeed jack was a warm friend and a gallant partisan and when he had the pen in hand seldom let slip an opportunity of letting the world know that rafferty was the greatest painter in europe and wondering at the petty jealousy of the academy which refused to make him an r a of stating that it was generally reported at the west end that mr <\s>
<s> rooney m p was appointed governor of barataria or of introducing into the subject in hand whatever it might be a compliment to the round towers or the giant's causeway <\s>
<s> and besides doing pen's work for him to the best of his ability his kind hearted comrade offered to forgo his saturday's and sunday's holiday and pass those days of holiday and rest as nurse tender to arthur who however insisted that the other should not forgo his pleasure and thankfully assured him that he could bear best his malady alone <\s>
<s> taking his supper at the back kitchen on the friday night after having achieved the work of the paper finucane informed captain costigan of the illness of their young friend in the temple and remembering the fact two days afterwards the captain went to lamb court and paid a visit to the invalid on sunday afternoon <\s>
<s> flanagan the laundress in tears in the sitting room and got a bad report of the poor dear young gentleman within <\s>
<s> pen's condition had so much alarmed her that she was obliged to have recourse to the stimulus of brandy to enable her to support the grief which his illness occasioned <\s>
<s> as she hung about his bed and endeavoured to minister to him her attentions became intolerable to the invalid and he begged her peevishly not to come near him <\s>
<s> hence the laundress's tears and redoubled grief and renewed application to the bottle which she was accustomed to use as an anodyne <\s>
<s> the captain rated the woman soundly for her intemperance and pointed out to her the fatal consequences which must ensue if she persisted in her imprudent courses <\s>
<s> pen who was by this time in a very fevered state yet was greatly pleased to receive costigan's visit <\s>
<s> he heard the ell known voice in his sitting room as he lay in the bedroom within and called the captain eagerly to him and thanked him for coming and begged him to take a chair and talk to him <\s>
<s> the captain felt the young man's pulse with great gravity his own tremulous and clammy hand growing steady for the instant while his finger pressed arthur's throbbing vein the pulse was beating very fiercely pen's face was haggard and hot his eyes were bloodshot and gloomy his bird as the captain pronounced the word afterwards giving a description of his condition had not been shaved for nearly a week <\s>
<s> pen made his visitor sit down and tossing and turning in his comfortless bed began to try and talk to the captain in a lively manner about the back kitchen about vauxhall and when they should go again and about fanny how was little fanny <\s>

<s> we know how she went home very sadly on the previous sunday evening after she had seen arthur light his lamp in his chambers whilst he was having his interview with bows <\s>

<s> i thought you did fanny answered looking fiercely at the melancholy old gentleman <\s>
<s> i've been fond of you ever since we came to live in this place he continued <\s>
<s> you were a child when i came and you used to like me fanny until three or four days ago until you saw this gentleman <\s>
<s> and now i suppose you are going to say ill of him said fanny <\s>
<s> bows that will make me like you better <\s>
<s> indeed i shall do no such thing bows answered i think he is a very good and honest young man <\s>
<s> you know that if you said a word against him i would never speak a word to you again never <\s>

<s> her cheeks flushed her frame trembled her eyes beamed love anger defiance <\s>
<s> you would like to speak ill of him she said but you daren't you know you daren't <\s>
<s> i knew him many years since bows continued when he was almost as young as you are and he had a romantic attachment for our friend the captain's daughter lady mirabel that is now <\s>

<s> a woman who loves a man will not ruin his prospects cause him to quarrel with his family and lead him into poverty and misery for her gratification <\s>
<s> an honest girl won't do that for her own sake or for the man's <\s>

<s> it was not my doing nor arthur's mr <\s>

<s> then he came to call and ask after us and very very good it was of a such grand gentleman to be so polite to humble folks like us <\s>

<s> he said as much himself fanny bows said and fanny asked through her sobs why why should he wish he had never seen her <\s>
<s> had she ever done him any harm <\s>
<s> oh she would perish rather than do him any harm <\s>
<s> whereupon the musician informed her of the conversation of the day previous showed her that pen could not and must not think of her as a wife fitting for him and that she as she valued her honest reputation must strive too to forget him <\s>
<s> and fanny leaving the musician convinced but still of the same mind and promising that she would avoid the danger which menaced her went back to the porter's lodge and told her mother all <\s>

<s> at the father's appearance the talk between mother and daughter ceased instantly <\s>
<s> bolton caressed and cajoled the surly undertaker's aide de camp and said lor mr <\s>
<s> who'd have thought to see you away from the club of a saturday night <\s>
<s> fanny dear get your pa some supper <\s>
<s> what will you have b <\s>
<s> the poor gurl's got a gathering in her eye or somethink in it i was lookin at it just now as you came in <\s>
<s> and she squeezed her daughter's hand as a signal of prudence and secrecy and fanny's tears were dried up likewise and by that wondrous hypocrisy and power of disguise which women practise and with which weapons of defence nature endows them the traces of her emotion disappeared and she went and took her work and sate in the corner so demure and quiet that the careless male parent never suspected that anything ailed her <\s>
<s> thus as if fate seemed determined to inflame and increase the poor child's malady and passion all circumstances and all parties round about her urged it on <\s>
<s> her mother encouraged and applauded it and the very words which bows used in endeavouring to repress her flame only augmented this unlucky fever <\s>
<s> pen was not wicked and a seducer pen was high minded in wishing to avoid her <\s>
<s> pen loved her the good and the great the magnificent youth with the chains of gold and the scented auburn hair <\s>
<s> and so he did or so he would have loved her five years back perhaps before the world had hardened the ardent and reckless boy before he was ashamed of a foolish and imprudent passion and strangled it as poor women do their illicit children not on account of the crime but of the shame and from dread that the finger of the world should point to them <\s>
<s> what respectable person in the world will not say he was quite right to avoid a marriage with an ill educated person of low degree whose relations a gentleman could not well acknowledge and whose manners would not become her new station and what philosopher would not tell him that the best thing to do with these little passions if they spring up is to get rid of them and let them pass over and cure them that no man dies about a woman or vice versa and that one or the other having found the impossibility of gratifying his or her desire in the particular instance must make the best of matters forget each other look out elsewhere and choose again <\s>
<s> and yet perhaps there may be something said on the other side <\s>
<s> perhaps bows was right in admiring that passion of pen's blind and unreasoning as it was that made him ready to stake his all for his love perhaps if self sacrifice is a laudable virtue mere worldly self sacrifice is not very much to be praised in fine let this be a reserved point to be settled by the individual moralist who chooses to debate it <\s>
<s> so much is certain that with the experience of the world which mr <\s>
<s> pen now had he would have laughed at and scouted the idea of marrying a penniless girl out of a kitchen <\s>
<s> and this point being fixed in his mind he was but doing his duty as an honest man in crushing any unlucky fondness which he might feel towards poor little fanny <\s>
<s> so she waited and waited in hopes that arthur would come <\s>
<s> she waited for a whole week and it was at the end of that time that the poor little creature heard from costigan of the illness under which arthur was suffering <\s>
<s> it chanced on that very evening after costigan had visited pen that arthur's uncle the excellent major arrived in town from buxton where his health had been mended and sent his valet morgan to make inquiries for arthur and to request that gentleman to breakfast with the major the next morning <\s>
<s> the major was merely passing through london on his way to the marquis of steyne's house of stillbrook where he was engaged to shoot partridges <\s>
<s> morgan came back to his master with a very long face <\s>
<s> he had seen mr <\s>
<s> arthur was very bad indeed mr <\s>
<s> arthur was in bed with a fever <\s>
<s> a doctor ought to be sent to him and morgan thought his case most alarming <\s>
<s> this was sad news indeed <\s>
<s> he had hoped that arthur could come down to stillbrook he had arranged that he should go and procured an invitation for his nephew from lord steyne <\s>
<s> he must go himself he couldn't throw lord steyne over the fever might be catching it might be measles he had never himself had the measles they were dangerous when contracted at his age <\s>
<s> was anybody with mr <\s>
<s> morgan said there was somebody a nussing of mr <\s>
<s> the major then asked had his nephew taken any advice <\s>
<s> morgan said he had asked that question and had been told that mr <\s>
<s> pendennis had had no doctor <\s>
<s> morgan's master was sincerely vexed at hearing of arthur's calamity <\s>
<s> he would have gone to him but what good could it do arthur that he the major should catch a fever <\s>
<s> his own ailments rendered it absolutely impossible that he should attend to anybody but himself <\s>
<s> but the young man must have advice the best advice and morgan was straightway despatched with a note from major pendennis to his friend doctor goodenough who by good luck happened to be in london and at home and who quitted his dinner instantly and whose carriage was in half an hour in upper temple lane near pen's chambers <\s>
<s> the major had asked the kind hearted physician to bring him news of his nephew at the club where he himself was dining and in the course of the night the doctor made his appearance <\s>
<s> the affair was very serious the patient was in a high fever he had had pen bled instantly and would see him the first thing in the morning <\s>
<s> the major went disconsolate to bed with this unfortunate news <\s>
<s> when goodenough came to see him according to his promise the next day the doctor had to listen for a quarter of an hour to an account of the major's own maladies before the latter had leisure to hear about arthur <\s>
<s> he had had a very bad night his his nurse said at one hour he had been delirious <\s>
<s> it might end badly his mother had better be sent for immediately <\s>
<s> the major wrote the letter to mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis with the greatest alacrity and at the same time with the most polite precautions <\s>
<s> as for going himself to the lad in his state it was impossible <\s>
<s> could i be of any use to him my dear doctor <\s>
<s> the doctor with a peculiar laugh said no he didn't think the major could be of any use that his own precious health required the most delicate treatment and that he had best go into the country and stay that he himself would take care to see the patient twice a day and do all in his power for him <\s>
<s> the major declared upon his honour that if he could be of any use he would rush to pen's chambers <\s>
<s> as it was morgan should go and see that everything was right <\s>
<s> the doctor must write to him by every post to stillbrook it was but forty miles distant from london and if anything happened he would come up at any sacrifice <\s>
<s> major pendennis transacted his benevolence by deputy and by post <\s>
<s> what else could he do as he said <\s>
<s> gad you know in these cases it's best not disturbing a fellow <\s>
<s> if a poor fellow goes to the bad why gad you know he's disposed of <\s>
<s> but in order to get well and in this my dear doctor i'm sure that you will agree with me the best way is to keep him quiet perfectly quiet <\s>
<s> thus it was the old gentleman tried to satisfy his conscience and he went his way that day to stillbrook by railway for railways have sprung up in the course of this narrative though they have not quite penetrated into pen's country yet and made his appearance in his usual trim order and curly wig at the dinner table of the marquis of steyne <\s>
<s> but we must do the major the justice to say that he was very unhappy and gloomy in demeanour <\s>
<s> wagg and wenham rallied him about his low spirits asked whether he was crossed in love <\s>
<s> and otherwise diverted themselves at his expense <\s>
<s> he lost his money at whist after dinner and actually trumped his partner's highest spade <\s>
<s> and the thoughts of the suffering boy of whom he was proud and whom he loved after his manner kept the old fellow awake half through the night and made him feverish and uneasy <\s>
<s> on the morrow he received a note in a handwriting which he did not know it was that of mr <\s>
<s> bows indeed saying that mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis had had a tolerable night and that as dr <\s>
<s> goodenough had stated that the major desired to be informed of his nephew's health he r <\s>
<s> b had sent him the news per rail <\s>
<s> the next day he was going out shooting about noon with some of the gentlemen staying at lord steyne's house and the company waiting for the carriages were assembled on the terrace in front of the house when a fly drove up from the neighbouring station and a grey headed rather shabby old gentleman jumped out and asked for major pendennis <\s>
<s> he took the major aside and spoke to him most of the gentlemen round about saw that something serious had happened from the alarmed look of the major's face <\s>
<s> wagg said it's a bailiff come down to nab the major but nobody laughed at the pleasantry <\s>
<s> what's the matter pendennis <\s>
<s> cried lord steyne with his strident voice anything wrong <\s>
<s> it's it's my boy that's dead said the major and burst into a sob the old man was quite overcome <\s>
<s> not dead my lord but very ill when i left london mr <\s>
<s> bows said in a low voice <\s>
<s> a britzka came up at this moment as the three men were speaking <\s>
<s> the peer looked at his watch <\s>
<s> you've twenty minutes to catch the mail train <\s>
<s> jump in pendennis and drive like h sir do you hear <\s>
<s> the carriage drove off swiftly with pendennis and his companions and let us trust that the oath will be pardoned to the marquis of steyne <\s>
<s> the major drove rapidly from the station to the temple and found a travelling carriage already before him and blocking up the narrow temple lane <\s>
<s> two ladies got out of it and were asking their way of the porters the major looked by chance at the panel of the carriage and saw the worn out crest of the eagle looking at the sun and the motto nec tenui penna painted beneath <\s>
<s> it was his brother's old carriage built many many years ago <\s>
<s> it was helen and laura that were asking their way to pen's room <\s>
<s> he ran up to them hastily clasped his sister's arm and kissed her hand and the three entered into lamb court and mounted the long gloomy stair <\s>
<s> they knocked very gently at the door on which arthur's name was written and it was opened by fanny bolton <\s>
<s> a critical chapter as fanny saw the two ladies and the anxious countenance of the eider who regarded her with a look of inscrutable alarm and terror the poor girl at once knew that pen's mother was before her there was a resemblance between the widow's haggard eyes and arthur's as he tossed in his bed in fever <\s>
<s> fanny looked wistfully at mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis and at laura afterwards there was no more expression in the latter's face than if it had been a mass of stone <\s>
<s> hard heartedness and gloom dwelt on the figures of both the new comers neither showed any the faintest gleam of mercy or sympathy for fanny <\s>
<s> she looked desperately from them to the major behind them <\s>
<s> old pendennis dropped his eyelids looking up ever so stealthily from under them at arthur's poor little nurse <\s>
<s> i i wrote to you yesterday if you please ma'am fanny said trembling in every limb as she spoke and as pale as laura whose sad menacing face looked over mrs <\s>
<s> i suppose i may now relieve you from nursing my son <\s>
<s> i am his mother you understand <\s>
<s> i this is the way to his oh wait a minute cried out fanny <\s>
<s> i must prepare you for his the widow whose face had been hopelessly cruel and ruthless here started back with a gasp and a little cry which she speedily stifled <\s>
<s> he's been so since yesterday fanny said trembling very much and with chattering teeth <\s>
<s> a horrid shriek of laughter came out of pen's room whereof the door was open and after several shouts the poor wretch began to sing a college drinking song and then to hurray and to shout as if he was in the midst of a wine party and to thump with his fist against the wainscot <\s>
<s> he was quite delirious <\s>
<s> he does not know me ma'am fanny said <\s>
<s> perhaps he will know his mother let me pass if you please and go in to him <\s>
<s> and the widow hastily pushed by little fanny and through the dark passage which led into pen's sitting room <\s>
<s> laura sailed by fanny too without a word and major pendennis followed them <\s>
<s> fanny sat down on a bench in the passage and cried and prayed as well as she could <\s>
<s> she would have died for him and they hated her <\s>
<s> they had not a word of thanks or kindness for her the fine ladies <\s>
<s> she sate there in the passage she did not know how long <\s>
<s> they never came out to speak to her <\s>
<s> she sate there until doctor goodenough came to pay his second visit that day he found the poor little thing at the door <\s>
<s> asked the good natured doctor <\s>
<s> has he had any rest <\s>
<s> go and ask them <\s>
<s> they're inside fanny answered <\s>
<s> fanny nodded her head and didn't speak <\s>
<s> you must go to bed yourself my poor little maid said the doctor <\s>
<s> you will be ill too if you don't <\s>
<s> oh mayn't i come and see him mayn't i come and see him <\s>
<s> i i love him so the little girl said and as she spoke she fell down on her knees and clasped hold of the doctor's hand in such an agony that to see her melted the kind physician's heart and caused a mist to come over his spectacles <\s>
<s> nurse has he taken his draught <\s>
<s> has he had any rest <\s>
<s> of course you must come and see him <\s>
<s> they'll let me sit here won't they sir <\s>
<s> i'll never make no noise <\s>
<s> i only ask to stop here fanny said <\s>
<s> on which the doctor called her a stupid little thing put her down upon the bench where pen's printer's devil used to sit so many hours tapped her pale cheek with his finger and bustled into the farther room <\s>
<s> pendennis was ensconced pale and solemn in a great chair by pen's bedside <\s>
<s> her watch was on the bed table by pen's medicines <\s>
<s> her bonnet and cloaks were laid in the window <\s>
<s> she had her bible in her lap without which she never travelled <\s>
<s> her first movement after seeing her son had been to take fanny's shawl and bonnet which were on his drawers and bring them out and drop them down upon his study table <\s>
<s> she had closed the door upon major pendennis and laura too and taken possession of her son <\s>
<s> she had had a great doubt and terror lest arthur should not know her but that pang was spared to her in part at least <\s>
<s> pen knew his mother quite well and familiarly smiled and nodded at her <\s>
<s> when she came in he instantly fancied that they were at home at fairoaks and began to talk and chatter and laugh in a rambling wild way <\s>
<s> laura could hear him outside <\s>
<s> his laughter shot shafts of poison into her heart <\s>
<s> it was true then <\s>
<s> he had been guilty and with that creature an intrigue with a servant maid and she had loved him and he was dying most likely raving and unrepentant <\s>
<s> the major now and then hummed out a word of remark or consolation which laura scarce heard <\s>
<s> a dismal sitting it was for all parties and when goodenough appeared he came like an angel into the room <\s>
<s> it is not only for the sick man it is for the sick man's friends that the doctor comes <\s>
<s> his presence is often as good for them as for the patient and they long for him yet more eagerly <\s>
<s> how we have all watched after him <\s>
<s> what an emotion the thrill of his carriage wheels in the street and at length at the door has made us feel <\s>
<s> how we hang upon his words and what a comfort we get from a smile or two if he can vouchsafe that sunshine to lighten our darkness <\s>
<s> who hasn't seen the mother prying into his face to know if there is hope for the sick infant that cannot speak and that lies yonder its little frame battling with fever <\s>
<s> ah how she looks into his eyes <\s>
<s> what thanks if there is light there what grief and pain if he casts them down and dares not say hope <\s>
<s> or it is the house father who is stricken <\s>
<s> the terrified wife looks on while the physician feels his patient's wrist smothering her agonies as the children have been called upon to stay their plays and their talk <\s>
<s> over the patient in the fever the wife expectant the children unconscious the doctor stands as if he were fate the dispenser of life and death he must let the patient off this time the woman prays so for his respite <\s>
<s> one can fancy how awful the responsibility must be to a conscientious man how cruel the feeling that he has given the wrong remedy or that it might have been possible to do better how harassing the sympathy with survivors if the case is unfortunate how immense the delight of victory <\s>
<s> having passed through a hasty ceremony of introduction to the new comers of whose arrival he had been made aware by the heartbroken little nurse in waiting without the doctor proceeded to examine the patient about whose condition of high fever there could be no mistake and on whom he thought it necessary to exercise the strongest antiphlogistic remedies in his power <\s>
<s> he consoled the unfortunate mother as best he might and giving her the most comfortable assurances on which he could venture that there was no reason to despair yet that everything might still be hoped from his youth the strength of his constitution and so forth and having done his utmost to allay the horrors of the alarmed matron he took the elder pendennis aside into the vacant room warrington's bedroom for the purpose of holding a little consultation <\s>
<s> the case was very critical <\s>
<s> the fever if not stopped might and would carry off the young fellow he must be bled forthwith the mother must be informed of this necessity <\s>
<s> why was that other young lady brought with her <\s>
<s> she was out of place in a sick room <\s>
<s> and there was another woman still be hanged to it <\s>
<s> the major said the the little person who opened the door <\s>
<s> his sister in law had brought the poor little devil's bonnet and shawl out flung them upon the study table <\s>
<s> did goodenough know anything about the the little person <\s>
<s> i just caught a glimpse of her as we passed in the major said and begad she was uncommonly nice looking <\s>
<s> the doctor looked queer the doctor smiled in the very gravest moments with life and death pending such strange contrasts and occasions of humour will arise and such smiles will pass to satirise the gloom as it were and to make it more gloomy <\s>
<s> i have it at last he said re entering the study and he wrote a couple of notes hastily at the table there and sealed one of them <\s>
<s> then taking up poor fanny's shawl and bonnet and the notes he went out in the passage to that poor little messenger and said quick nurse you must carry this to the surgeon and bid him come instantly and then go to my house and ask for my servant harbottle and tell him to get this prescription prepared and wait until i until it is ready <\s>
<s> it may take a little in preparation <\s>
<s> so poor fanny trudged away with her two notes and found the apothecary who lived in the strand hard by and who came straightway his lancet in his pocket to operate on his patient and then fanny made for the doctor's house in hanover square <\s>
<s> the doctor was at home again before the prescription was made up which took harbottle his servant such a long time in compounding and during the remainder of arthur's illness poor fanny never made her appearance in the quality of nurse at his chambers any more <\s>
<s> but for that day and the next a little figure might be seen lurking about pen's staircase a sad sad little face looked at and interrogated the apothecary and the apothecary's boy and the laundress and the kind physician himself as they passed out of the chambers of the sick man <\s>
<s> and on the third day the kind doctor's chariot stopped at shepherd's inn and the good and honest and benevolent man went into the porter's lodge and tended a little patient whom he had there for the best remedy he found was on the day when he was enabled to tell fanny bolton that the crisis was over and that there was at length every hope for arthur pendennis <\s>
<s> costigan esquire late of her majesty's service saw the doctor's carriage and criticised its horses and appointments <\s>
<s> the general said and as foin a pair of high stepping bee horses as ever a gentleman need sit behoind let alone a docthor <\s>
<s> there's no ind to the proide and ar'gance of them docthors nowadays not but that is a good one and a scoientific cyarkter and a roight good fellow bedad and he's brought the poor little girl well troo her faver bows me boy and so pleased was mr <\s>
<s> costigan with the doctor's behaviour and skill that whenever he met dr <\s>
<s> goodenough's carriage in future he made a point of saluting it and the physician inside in as courteous and magnificent a manner as if dr <\s>
<s> goodenough had been the lord liftenant himself and captain costigan had been in his glory in phaynix park <\s>
<s> the widow's gratitude to the physician knew no bounds or scarcely any bounds at least <\s>
<s> the kind gentleman laughed at the idea of taking a fee from a literary man or the widow of a brother practitioner and she determined when she got to fairoaks that she would send goodenough the silver gilt vase the jewel of the house and the glory of the late john pendennis preserved in green baize and presented to him at bath by the lady elizabeth firebrace on the recovery of her son the late sir anthony firebrace from the scarlet fever <\s>
<s> hippocrates hygeia king bladud and a wreath of serpents surmount the cup to this day which was executed in their finest manner by messrs <\s>
<s> abednego of milsom street and the inscription was by mr <\s>
<s> birch tutor to the young baronet <\s>
<s> this priceless gem of art the widow determined to devote to goodenough the preserver of her son and there was scarcely any other favour which her gratitude would not have conferred upon him except one which he desired most and which was that she should think a little charitably and kindly of poor fanny of whose artless sad story he had got something during his interviews with her and of whom he was induced to think very kindly not being disposed indeed to give much credit to pen for his conduct in the affair or not knowing what that conduct had been <\s>
<s> he knew enough however to be aware that the poor infatuated little girl was without stain as yet that while she had been in pen's room it was to see the last of him as she thought and that arthur was scarcely aware of her presence and that she suffered under the deepest and most pitiful grief at the idea of losing him dead or living <\s>
<s> but on the one or two occasions when goodenough alluded to fanny the widow's countenance always soft and gentle assumed an expression so cruel and inexorable that the doctor saw it was in vain to ask her for justice or pity and he broke off all entreaties and ceased making any further allusions regarding his little client <\s>
<s> there is a complaint which neither poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the east could allay in the men in his time as we are informed by a popular poet of the days of elizabeth and which when exhibited in women no medical discoveries or practice subsequent neither homoeopathy nor hydropathy nor mesmerism nor dr <\s>

<s> some of those mischievous and prosaic people who carp and calculate at every detail of the romancer and want to know for instance how when the characters in the critic are at a dead lock with their daggers at each other's throats they are to be got out of that murderous complication of circumstances may be induced to ask how it was possible in a set of chambers in the temple consisting of three rooms two cupboards a passage and a coal box arthur a sick gentleman helen his mother laura her adopted daughter martha their country attendant mrs <\s>

<s> arthur pendennis's boy and others could be accommodated the answer is given at once that almost everybody in the temple was out of town and that there was scarcely a single occupant of pen's house in lamb court except those who were occupied round the sick bed of the sick gentleman about whose fever we have not given a lengthy account neither enlarge we very much upon the more cheerful theme of his recovery <\s>
<s> everybody we have said was out of town and of course such a fashionable man as young mr <\s>

<s> several of his things have appeared in the annuals and in manuscript in the nobility's albums he was a camford man and very nearly got the english prize poem it was said sibwright however was absent and his bed given up to miss bell <\s>
<s> it was the prettiest little brass bed in the world with chintz curtains lined with pink he had a mignonette box in his bedroom window and the mere sight of his little exhibition of shiny boots arranged in trim rows over his wardrobe was a gratification to the beholder <\s>
<s> he had a museum of scent pomatum and bear's grease pots quite curious to examine too and a choice selection of portraits of females almost always in sadness and generally in disguise or deshabille glittered round the neat walls of his elegant little bower of repose <\s>

<s> and in sibwright's sitting room while there was quite an infantine law library clad in skins of fresh new born calf there was a tolerably large collection of classical books which he could not read and of english and french works of poetry and fiction which he read a great deal too much <\s>

<s> bangham had no practice did not come to chambers thrice in a term went a circuit for those mysterious reasons which make men go circuit and his room served as a great convenience to sibwright when that young gentleman gave his little dinners <\s>
<s> it must be confessed that these two gentlemen have nothing to do with our history will never appear in it again probably but we cannot help glancing through their doors as they happen to be open to us and as we pass to pen's rooms as in the pursuit of our own business in life through the strand at the club nay at church itself we cannot help peeping at the shops on the way or at our neighbour's dinner or at the faces under the bonnets in the next pew <\s>
<s> very many years after the circumstances about which we are at present occupied laura with a blush and a laugh showing much humour owned to having read a french novel once much in vogue and when her husband asked her wondering where on earth she could have got such a volume she owned that it was in the temple when she lived in mr <\s>
<s> and also i never confessed she said on that same occasion what i must now own to that i opened the japanned box and took out that strange looking wig inside it and put it on and looked at myself in the glass in it <\s>

<s> when miss laura played this prank with the wig you can't suppose that pen could have been very ill upstairs otherwise though she had grown to care for him ever so little common sense of feeling and decorum would have prevented her from performing any tricks or trying any disguises <\s>
<s> but all sorts of events had occurred in the course of the last few days which had contributed to increase or account for her gaiety and a little colony of the reader's old friends and acquaintances was by this time established in lamb court temple and round pen's sick bed there <\s>
<s> pendennis's servant had arrived from fairoaks being summoned thence by the major who justly thought her presence would be comfortable and useful to her mistress and her young master for neither of whom the constant neighbourhood of mrs <\s>

<s> martha then made her appearance in due season to wait upon mr <\s>
<s> pendennis nor did that lady go once to bed until the faithful servant had reached her when with a heart full of maternal thankfulness she went and lay down upon warrington's straw mattress and among his mathematical books as has been already described <\s>
<s> it is true that ere that day a great and delightful alteration in pen's condition had taken place <\s>
<s> the fever subjugated by dr <\s>
<s> goodenough's blisters potions and lancet had left the young man or only returned at intervals of feeble intermittence his wandering senses had settled in his weakened brain he had had time to kiss and bless his mother for coming to him and calling for laura and his uncle who were both affected according to their different natures by his wan appearance his lean shrunken hands his hollow eyes and voice his thin bearded face to press their hands and thank them affectionately and after this greeting and after they had been turned out of the room by his affectionate nurse he had sunk into a fine sleep which had lasted for about sixteen hours at the end of which period he awoke calling out that he was very hungry <\s>
<s> if it is hard to be ill and to loathe food oh how pleasant to be getting well and to be feeling hungry how hungry <\s>
<s> alas the joys of convalescence become feebler with increasing years as other joys do and then and then comes that illness when one does not convalesce at all <\s>
<s> on the day of this happy event too came another arrival in lamb court <\s>

<s> his surprise was after all not very great when he found the chambers of his sick friend occupied and his old acquaintance the major seated demurely in an easy chair warrington had let himself into the rooms with his own passkey listening or pretending to listen to a young lady who was reading to him a play of shakspeare in a low sweet voice <\s>
<s> the lady stopped and started and laid down her book at the apparition of the tall traveller with the cigar and the carpet bag <\s>
<s> he blushed he flung the cigar into the passage he took off his hat and dropped that too and going up to the major seized that old gentleman's hand and asked questions about arthur <\s>
<s> the major answered in a tremulous though cheery voice it was curious how emotion seemed to olden him and returning warrington's pressure with a shaking hand told him the news of arthur's happy crisis of his mother's arrival with her young charge with miss <\s>
<s> you need not tell me her name mr <\s>
<s> warrington said with great animation for he was affected and elated with the thought of his friend's recovery you need not tell me your name <\s>

<s> and he held out his hand and took hers <\s>
<s> immense kindness and tenderness gleamed from under his rough eyebrows and shook his voice as he gazed at her and spoke to her <\s>

<s> as these two were standing in this attitude the door of pen's bedchamber was opened stealthily as his mother was wont to open it and warrington saw another lady who first looked at him and then turning round towards the bed said hsh <\s>
<s> and put up her hand <\s>
<s> it was to pen helen was turning and giving caution <\s>
<s> he called out with a feeble tremulous but cheery voice come in stunner come in warrington <\s>
<s> i knew it was you by the by the smoke old boy he said as holding his worn hand out and with tears at once of weakness and pleasure in his eyes he greeted his friend <\s>
<s> i i beg pardon ma'am for smoking warrington said who now almost for the first time blushed for his wicked propensity <\s>
<s> helen only said god bless you mr <\s>
<s> she was so happy she would have liked to kiss george <\s>
<s> then and after the friends had had a brief very brief interview the delighted and inexorable mother giving her hand to warrington sent him out of the room too back to laura and the major who had not resumed their play of cymbeline where they had left it off at the arrival of the rightful owner of pen's chambers <\s>
<s> convalescence our duty now is to record a fact concerning pendennis which however shameful and disgraceful when told regarding the chief personage and godfather of a novel must nevertheless be made known to the public who reads his veritable memoirs <\s>
<s> having gone to bed ill with fever and suffering to a certain degree under the passion of love after he had gone through his physical malady and had been bled and had been blistered and had had his head shaved and had been treated and medicamented as the doctor ordained it is a fact that when he rallied up from his bodily ailment his mental malady had likewise quitted him and he was no more in love with fanny bolton than you or i who are much too wise or too moral to allow our hearts to go gadding after porters daughters <\s>
<s> he laughed at himself as he lay on his pillow thinking of this second cure which had been effected upon him <\s>
<s> he did not care the least about fanny now he wondered how he ever should have cared and according to his custom made an autopsy of that dead passion and anatomised his own defunct sensation for his poor little nurse <\s>
<s> what could have made him so hot and eager about her but a few weeks back <\s>
<s> not her wit not her breeding not her beauty there were hundreds of women better looking than she <\s>
<s> it was out of himself that the passion had gone it did not reside in her <\s>
<s> she was the same but the eyes which saw were changed and alas that it should be so <\s>
<s> were not particularly eager to see her any more <\s>
<s> he felt very well disposed towards the little thing and so forth but as for violent personal regard such as he had but a few weeks ago it had fled under the influence of the pill and lancet which had destroyed the fever in his frame <\s>
<s> and an immense source of comfort and gratitude it was to pendennis though there was something selfish in that feeling as in most others of our young man that he had been enabled to resist temptation at the time when the danger was greatest and had no particular cause of self reproach as he remembered his conduct towards the young girl <\s>
<s> as from a precipice down which he might have fallen so from the fever from which he had recovered he reviewed the fanny bolton snare now that he had escaped out of it but i'm not sure that he was not ashamed of the very satisfaction which he experienced <\s>
<s> it is pleasant perhaps but it is humiliating to own that you love no more <\s>
<s> meanwhile the kind smiles and tender watchfulness of the mother at his bedside filled the young man with peace and security <\s>
<s> to see that health was returning was all the unwearied nurse demanded to execute any caprice or order of her patient's her chiefest joy and reward <\s>
<s> he felt himself environed by her love and thought himself almost as grateful for it as he had been when weak and helpless in childhood <\s>
<s> some misty notions regarding the first part of his illness and that fanny had nursed him pen may have had but they were so dim that he could not realise them with accuracy or distinguish them from what he knew to be delusions which had occurred and were remembered during the delirium of his fever <\s>
<s> so as he had not thought proper on former occasions to make any allusions about fanny bolton to his mother of course he could not now confide to her his sentiments regarding fanny or make this worthy lady a confidante <\s>
<s> it was on both sides an unlucky precaution and want of confidence and a word or two in time might have spared the good lady and those connected with her a deal of pain and anguish <\s>
<s> seeing miss bolton installed as nurse and tender to pen i am sorry to say mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis had put the worst construction on the fact of the intimacy of these two unlucky young persons and had settled in her own mind that the accusations against arthur were true <\s>
<s> why not have stopped to inquire there are stories to a man's disadvantage that the women who are fondest of him are always the most eager to believe <\s>
<s> isn't a man's wife often the first to be jealous of him <\s>
<s> poor pen got a good stock of this suspicious kind of love from the nurse who was now watching over him and the kind and pure creature thought that her boy had gone through a malady much more awful and debasing than the mere physical fever and was stained by crime as well as weakened by illness <\s>
<s> the consciousness of this she had to bear perforce silently and to try to put a mask of cheerfulness and confidence over her doubt and despair and inward horror <\s>
<s> when captain shandon at boulogne read the next number of the pall mall gazette it was to remark to mrs <\s>
<s> shandon that jack finucane's hand was no longer visible in the leading articles and that mr <\s>
<s> warrington must be at work there again <\s>
<s> i know the crack of his whip in a hundred and the cut which the fellow's thong leaves <\s>
<s> there's jack bludyer goes to work like a butcher and mangles a subject <\s>
<s> warrington finished a man and lays his cuts neat and regular straight down the back and drawing blood every line at which dreadful metaphor mrs <\s>
<s> shandon said law charles how can you talk so <\s>
<s> i always thought mr <\s>
<s> warrington very high but a kind gentleman and i'm sure he was most kind to the children <\s>
<s> upon which shandon said yes he's kind to the children but he's savage to the men and to be sure my dear you don't understand a word about what i'm saying and it's best you shouldn't for it's little good comes out of writing for newspapers and it's better here living easy at boulogne where the wine's plenty and the brandy costs but two francs a bottle <\s>
<s> mix us another tumbler mary my dear we'll go back into harness soon <\s>
<s> cras ingens iterabimus aequor bad luck to it <\s>
<s> in a word warrington went to work with all his might in place of his prostrate friend and did pen's portion of the pall mall gazette with a vengeance as the saying is <\s>
<s> he wrote occasional articles and literary criticisms he attended theatres and musical performances and discoursed about them with his usual savage energy <\s>
<s> his hand was too strong for such small subjects and it pleased him to tell arthur's mother and uncle and laura that there was no hand in all the band of penmen more graceful and light more pleasant and more elegant than arthur's <\s>
<s> the people in this country ma'am don't understand what style is or they would see the merits of our young one he said to mrs <\s>
<s> i call him ours ma'am for i bred him and i am as proud of him as you are and bating a little wilfulness and a little selfishness and a little dandification i don't know a more honest or loyal or gentle creature <\s>
<s> his pen is wicked sometimes but he is as kind as a young lady as miss laura here and i believe he would not do any living mortal harm <\s>
<s> at this helen though she heaved a deep deep sigh and laura though she too was sadly wounded nevertheless were most thankful for warrington's good opinion of arthur and loved him for being so attached to their pen <\s>
<s> and major pendennis was loud in his praises of mr <\s>
<s> warrington more loud and enthusiastic than it was the major's wont to be <\s>
<s> he is a gentleman my dear creature he said to helen every inch a gentleman my good madam the suffolk warringtons charles the first's baronets what could he be but a gentleman come out of that family father sir miles warrington ran away with beg your pardon miss bell <\s>
<s> sir miles was a very well known man in london and a friend of the prince of wales this gentleman is a man of the greatest talents the very highest accomplishments sure to get on if he had a motive to put his energies to work <\s>
<s> laura blushed for herself whilst the major was talking and praising arthur's hero <\s>
<s> as she looked at warrington's manly face and dark melancholy eyes this young person had been speculating about him and had settled in her mind that he must have been the victim of an unhappy attachment and as she caught herself so speculating why miss bell blushed <\s>
<s> warrington got chambers hard by grenier's chambers in flag court and having executed pen's task with great energy in the morning his delight and pleasure of an afternoon was to come and sit with the sick man's company in the sunny autumn evenings and he had the honour more than once of giving miss bell his arm for a walk in the temple gardens to take which pastime when the frank laura asked of helen permission the major eagerly said yes yes begad of course you go out with him it's like the country you know everybody goes out with everybody in the gardens and there are beadles you know and that sort of thing everybody walks in the temple gardens <\s>
<s> if the great arbiter of morals did not object why should simple helen <\s>
<s> she was glad that her girl should have such fresh air as the river could give and to see her return with heightened colour and spirits from these harmless excursions <\s>
<s> laura and helen had come you must know to a little explanation <\s>
<s> when the news arrived of pen's alarming illness laura insisted upon accompanying the terrified mother to london would not hear of the refusal which the still angry helen gave her and when refused a second time yet more sternly and when it seemed that the poor lost lad's life was despaired of and when it was known that his conduct was such as to render all thoughts of union hopeless laura had with many tears told her mother a secret with which every observant person who reads this story was acquainted already <\s>
<s> now she never could marry him was she to be denied the consolation of owning how fondly how truly how entirely she had loved him <\s>
<s> the mingling tears of the woman appeased the agony of their grief somewhat and the sorrows and terrors of their journey were at least in so far mitigated that they shared them together <\s>
<s> what could fanny expect when suddenly brought up for sentence before a couple of such judges <\s>
<s> nothing but swift condemnation awful punishment merciless dismissal <\s>
<s> women are cruel critics in cases such as that in which poor fanny was implicated and we like them to be so for besides the guard which a man places round his own harem and the defences which a woman has in her heart her faith and honour hasn't she all her own friends of her own sex to keep watch that she does not go astray and to tear her to pieces if she is found erring <\s>
<s> when our mahmouds or selims of baker street or belgrave square visit their fatimas with condign punishment their mothers sew up fatima's sack for her and her sisters and sisters in law see her well under water <\s>
<s> and this present writer does not say nay <\s>
<s> he protests most solemnly he is a turk too <\s>
<s> he wears a turban and a beard like another and is all for the sack practice bismillah <\s>
<s> but o you spotless who have the right of capital punishment vested in you at least be very cautious that you make away with the proper if so she may be called person <\s>
<s> be very sure of the fact before you order the barge out and don't pop your subject into the bosphorus until you are quite certain that she deserves it <\s>
<s> this is all i would urge in poor fatima's behalf absolutely all not a word more by the beard of the prophet <\s>
<s> if she's guilty down with her heave over the sack away with it into the golden horn bubble and squeak and justice being done give way men and let us pull back to supper <\s>
<s> so the major did not in any way object to warrington's continued promenades with miss laura but like a benevolent old gentleman encouraged in every way the intimacy of that couple <\s>
<s> were there any exhibitions in town <\s>
<s> he was for warrington conducting her to them <\s>
<s> if warrington had proposed to take her to vauxhall itself this most complaisant of men would have seen no harm nor would helen if pendennis the elder had so ruled it nor would there have been any harm between two persons whose honour was entirely spotless between warrington who saw in intimacy a pure and high minded and artless woman for the first time in his life and laura who too for the first time was thrown into the constant society of a gentleman of great natural parts and powers of pleasing who possessed varied acquirements enthusiasm simplicity humour and that freshness of mind which his simple life and habits gave him and which contrasted so much with pen's dandy indifference of manner and faded sneer <\s>
<s> in warrington's very uncouthness there was a refinement which the other's finery lacked <\s>
<s> in his energy his respect his desire to please his hearty laughter or simple confiding pathos what a difference to sultan pen's yawning sovereignty and languid acceptance of homage <\s>
<s> what had made pen at home such a dandy and such a despot <\s>
<s> the women had spoiled him as we like them and as they like to do <\s>
<s> they had cloyed him with obedience and surfeited him with sweet respect and submission until he grew weary of the slaves who waited upon him and their caresses and cajoleries excited him no more <\s>
<s> abroad he was brisk and lively and eager and impassioned enough most men are so constituted and so nurtured does this like the former sentence run a chance of being misinterpreted and does any one dare to suppose that the writer would incite the women to revolt <\s>
<s> nevert by the whiskers of the prophet again he says <\s>
<s> he wears a beard and he likes his women to be slaves <\s>
<s> what man would be henpecked i say <\s>
<s> we will cut off all the heads in christendom or turkeydom rather than that <\s>
<s> well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the post chaise <\s>
<s> as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldn't have it out or how daringly he robbed a bird's nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggar boy who came into the yard and so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us <\s>
<s> being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him <\s>
<s> this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writer's head and which said that the greatest rascal cut throats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals <\s>
<s> and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees <\s>
<s> she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news <\s>
<s> you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again and marriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tears and there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart <\s>
<s> why then you meet somebody else and twine your young affections round number two <\s>
<s> it is your nature so to do <\s>
<s> do you suppose it is all for the man's sake that you love and not a bit for your own <\s>
<s> do you suppose you would drink if you were not thirsty or eat if you were not hungry <\s>
<s> so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably good looking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody <\s>
<s> and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped it she there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled it and when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr <\s>
<s> george warrington what on earth was to prevent her from thinking him a most odd original agreeable and pleasing person <\s>
<s> a long time afterwards when these days were over and fate in its own way had disposed of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in lamb court perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of pen the convalescent <\s>
<s> the major had a favourable opinion of september in london from that time forward and declared at his clubs and in society that the dead season in town was often pleasant doosid pleasant begad <\s>
<s> he used to go home to his lodgings in bury street of a night wondering that it was already so late and that the evening had passed away so quickly <\s>
<s> he made his appearance at the temple pretty constantly in the afternoon and tugged up the long black staircase with quite a benevolent activity and perseverance <\s>
<s> and he made interest with the chef at bays's that renowned cook the superintendence of whose work upon gastronomy compelled the gifted author to stay in the metropolis to prepare little jellies delicate clear soups aspics and other trifles good for invalids which morgan the valet constantly brought down to the little lamb court colony <\s>
<s> and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr <\s>
<s> the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didn't in the least like the bitter flavour but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the major's health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general <\s>
<s> major pendennis returned thanks with the utmost gravity and in a speech in which he used the words the present occasion at least the proper number of times <\s>
<s> pen cheered with his feeble voice from his armchair <\s>
<s> warrington taught miss laura to cry hear <\s>
<s> and tapped the table with his knuckles <\s>
<s> pidgeon the attendant grinned and honest doctor goodenough found the party so merrily engaged when he came in to pay his faithful gratuitous visit <\s>
<s> warrington knew sibwright who lived below and that gallant gentleman in reply to a letter informing him of the use to which his apartment had been put wrote back the most polite and flowery letter of acquiescence he placed his chambers at the service of their fair occupants his bed at their disposal his carpets at their feet <\s>
<s> everybody was kindly disposed towards the sick man and his family <\s>
<s> his heart and his mother's too as we may fancy melted within him at the thought of so much good feeling and good nature <\s>
<s> let pen's biographer be pardoned for alluding to a time not far distant when a somewhat similar mishap brought him a providential friend a kind physician and a thousand proofs of a most touching and surprising kindness and sympathy <\s>
<s> there was a piano in mr <\s>
<s> sibwright's chamber indeed this gentleman a lover of all the arts performed himself and excellently ill too upon the instrument and had had a song dedicated to him the words by himself the air by his devoted friend leopoldo twankidillo and at this music box as mr <\s>
<s> warrington called it laura at first with a great deal of tremor and blushing which became her very much played and sang sometimes of an evening simple airs and old songs of home <\s>
<s> her voice was a rich contralto and warrington who scarcely knew one tune from another and who had but one tune or bray in his repertoire a most discordant imitation of god save the king' sat rapt in delight listening to these songs <\s>
<s> he could follow their rhythm if not their harmony and he could watch with a constant and daily growing enthusiasm the pure and tender and generous creature who made the music <\s>
<s> i wonder how that poor pale little girl in the black bonnet who used to stand at the lamp post in lamb court sometimes of an evening looking up to the open windows from which the music came liked to hear it <\s>
<s> when pen's bedtime came the songs were hushed <\s>
<s> lights appeared in the upper room his room whither the widow used to conduct him and then the major and mr <\s>
<s> warrington and sometimes miss laura would have a game at ecarte or backgammon or she would sit by working a pair of slippers in worsted a pair of gentleman's slippers they might have been for arthur or for george or for major pendennis one of those three would have given anything for the slippers <\s>
<s> whilst such business as this was going on within a rather shabby old gentleman would come and lead away the pale girl in the black bonnet who had no right to be abroad in the night air and the temple porters the few laundresses and other amateurs who had been listening to the concert would also disappear <\s>
<s> just before ten o'clock there was another musical performance namely that of the chimes of st <\s>
<s> clement's clock in the strand which played the clear cheerful notes of a psalm before it proceeded to ring its ten fatal strokes <\s>
<s> as they were ringing laura began to fold up the slippers martha from fairoaks appeared with a bed candle and a constant smile on her face the major said god bless my soul is it so late <\s>
<s> warrington and he left their unfinished game and got up and shook hands with miss bell <\s>
<s> martha from fairoaks lighted them out of the passage and down the stair and as they descended they could hear her bolting and locking the sporting door after them upon her young mistress and herself <\s>
<s> if there had been any danger grinning martha said she would have got down that thar hooky soord which hung up in gantleman's room meaning the damascus scimitar with the names of the prophet engraved on the blade and the red velvet scabbard which percy sibwright esquire brought back from his tour in the levant along with an albanian dress and which he wore with such elegant effect at lady mullingar's fancy ball gloucester square hyde park <\s>
<s> it entangled itself in miss kewsey's train who appeared in the dress in which she with her mamma had been presented to their sovereign the latter by the l d ch nc ll r's lady and led to events which have nothing to do with this history <\s>
<s> is not miss kewsey now mrs <\s>
<s> has sibwright not got a county court good night laura and fairoaks martha <\s>
<s> sleep well and wake happy pure and gentle lady <\s>
<s> sometimes after these evenings warrington would walk a little way with major pendennis just a little way just as far as the temple gate as the strand as charing cross as the club he was not going into the club <\s>
<s> well as far as bury street where he would laughingly shake hands on the major's own door step <\s>
<s> they had been talking about laura all the way <\s>
<s> it was wonderful how enthusiastic the major who as we know used to dislike her had grown to be regarding the young lady dev'lish fine girl begad <\s>
<s> dev'lish well mannered girl my sister in law has the manners of a duchess and would bring up any girl well <\s>
<s> miss bell's a little countryfied <\s>
<s> but the smell of the hawthorn is pleasant demmy <\s>
<s> your london girls would give many a guinea for a bouquet like that natural flowers begad <\s>
<s> and she's a little money too nothing to speak of but a pooty little bit of money <\s>
<s> in all which opinions no doubt mr <\s>
<s> warrington agreed and though he laughed as he shook hands with the major his face fell as he left his veteran companion and he strode back to chambers and smoked pipe after pipe long into the night and wrote article upon article more and more savage in lieu of friend pen disabled <\s>
<s> well it was a happy time for almost all parties concerned <\s>
<s> sleeping and eating were his constant occupations <\s>
<s> his appetite was something frightful <\s>
<s> he was ashamed of exhibiting it before laura and almost before his mother who laughed and applauded him <\s>
<s> as the roast chicken of his dinner went away he eyed the departing friend with sad longing and began to long for jelly or tea or what not <\s>
<s> he was like an ogre in devouring <\s>
<s> the doctor cried stop but pen would not <\s>
<s> nature called out to him more loudly than the doctor and that kind and friendly physician handed him over with a very good grace to the other healer <\s>
<s> and here let us speak very tenderly and in the strictest confidence of an event which befell him and to which he never liked an allusion <\s>
<s> during his delirium the ruthless goodenough ordered ice to be put to his head and all his lovely hair to be cut <\s>
<s> it was done in the time of of the other nurse who left every single hair of course in a paper for the widow to count and treasure up <\s>
<s> she never believed but that the girl had taken away some of it but then women are so suspicious upon these matters <\s>
<s> when this direful loss was made visible to major pendennis as of course it was the first time the elder saw the poor young man's shorn pate and when pen was quite out of danger and gaining daily vigour the major with something like blushes and a queer wink of his eyes said he knew of a a person a coiffeur in fact a good man whom he would send down to the temple and who would a apply a a temporary remedy to that misfortune <\s>
<s> laura looked at warrington with the archest sparkle in her eyes warrington fairly burst out into a boohoo of laughter even the widow was obliged to laugh and the major erubescent confounded the impudence of the young folks and said when he had his hair cut he would keep a lock of it for miss laura <\s>
<s> warrington voted that pen should wear a barrister's wig <\s>
<s> there was sibwright's down below which would become him hugely <\s>
<s> pen said stuff and seemed as confused as his uncle and the end was that a gentleman from burlington arcade waited next day upon mr <\s>
<s> pendennis and had a private interview with him in his bedroom and a week afterwards the same individual appeared with a box under his arm and an ineffable grin of politeness on his face and announced that he had brought ome mr <\s>
<s> pendennis's ead of air <\s>
<s> it must have been a grand but melancholy sight to see pen in the recesses of his apartment sadly contemplating his ravaged beauty and the artificial means of hiding its ruin <\s>
<s> he appeared at length in the ead of air but warrington laughed so that pen grew sulky and went back for his velvet cap a neat turban which the fondest of mammas had worked for him <\s>
<s> warrington and miss bell got some flowers off the ladies bonnets and made a wreath with which they decorated the wig and brought it out in procession and did homage before it <\s>
<s> in fact they indulged in a hundred sports jularities waggeries and petits jeux innocens so that the second and third floors of number 6 lamb court temple rang with more cheerfulness and laughter than had been known in those precincts for many a long day <\s>
<s> at last after about ten days of this life one evening when the little spy of the court came out to take her usual post of observation at the lamp there was no music from the second floor window there were no lights in the third story chambers the windows of each were open and the occupants were gone <\s>
<s> flanagan the laundress told fanny what had happened <\s>
<s> the ladies and all the party had gone to richmond for change of air <\s>
<s> the antique travelling chariot was brought out again and cushioned with many pillows for pen and his mother and miss laura went in the most affable manner in the omnibus under the guardianship of mr <\s>
<s> he came back and took possession of his old bed that night in the vacant and cheerless chambers and to his old books and his old pipes but not perhaps to his old sleep <\s>
<s> the widow had left a jar full of flowers upon his table prettily arranged and when he entered they filled the solitary room with odour <\s>
<s> they were memorials of the kind gentle souls who had gone away and who had decorated for a little while that lonely cheerless place <\s>
<s> he had had the happiest days of his whole life george felt he knew it now they were just gone he went and took up the flowers and put his face to them and smelt them perhaps kissed them <\s>
<s> as he put them down he rubbed his rough hand across his eyes with a bitter word and laugh <\s>
<s> he would have given his whole life and soul to win that prize which arthur rejected <\s>
<s> did she want fame <\s>
<s> he would have won it for her devotion a great heart full of pent up tenderness and manly love and gentleness was there for her if she might take it <\s>
<s> but it might not be <\s>
<s> fate had ruled otherwise <\s>
<s> even if i could she would not have me george thought <\s>
<s> what has an ugly rough old fellow like me to make any woman like him <\s>
<s> i'm getting old and i've made no mark in life <\s>
<s> i've neither good looks nor youth nor money nor reputation <\s>
<s> a man must be able to do something besides stare at her and offer on his knees his smooth devotion to make a woman like him <\s>
<s> what can i do <\s>
<s> lots of young fellows have passed me in the race what they call the prizes of life didn't seem to me worth the trouble of the struggle <\s>
<s> if she had been mine and liked a diamond ah <\s>
<s> shouldn't she have worn it <\s>
<s> psha what a fool i am to brag of what i would have done <\s>
<s> we are the slaves of destiny <\s>
<s> our lots are shaped for us and mine is ordained long ago <\s>
<s> come let us have a pipe and put the smell of these flowers out of court poor little silent flowers <\s>
<s> you'll be dead to morrow <\s>
<s> what business had you to show your red cheeks in this dingy place <\s>
<s> by his bedside george found a new bible which the widow had placed there with a note inside saying that she had not seen the book amongst his collection in a room where she had spent a number of hours and where god had vouchsafed to her prayers the life of her son and that she gave to arthur's friend the best thing she could and besought him to read in the volume sometimes and to keep it as a token of a grateful mother's regard and affection <\s>
<s> poor george mournfully kissed the book as he had done the flowers and the morning found him still reading in its awful pages in which so many stricken hearts in which so many tender and faithful souls have found comfort under calamity and refuge and hope in affliction <\s>
<s> fanny's occupation's gone good helen ever since her son's illness had taken as we have seen entire possession of the young man of his drawers and closets and all which they contained whether shirts that wanted buttons or stockings that required mending or must it be owned <\s>
<s> letters that lay amongst those articles of raiment and which of course it was necessary that somebody should answer during arthur's weakened and incapable condition <\s>
<s> pendennis was laudably desirous to have some explanations about the dreadful fanny bolton mystery regarding which she had never breathed a word to her son though it was present in her mind always and occasioned her inexpressible anxiety and disquiet <\s>
<s> she had caused the brass knocker to be screwed off the inner door of the chambers where upon the postman's startling double rap would as she justly argued disturb the rest of her patient and she did not allow him to see any letter which arrived whether from bootmakers who importuned him or hatters who had a heavy account to make up against next saturday and would be very much obliged if mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis would have the kindness to settle etc <\s>
<s> of these documents pen who was always freehanded and careless of course had his share and though no great one one quite enough to alarm his scrupulous and conscientious mother <\s>
<s> she had some savings pen's magnificent self denial and her own economy amounting from her great simplicity and avoidance of show to parsimony almost had enabled her to put by a little sum of money a part of which she delightedly consecrated to the paying off the young gentleman's obligations <\s>
<s> at this price many a worthy youth and respected reader would hand over his correspondence to his parents and perhaps there is no greater test of a man's regularity and easiness of conscience than his readiness to face the postman <\s>
<s> blessed is he who is made happy by the sound of the rat tat <\s>
<s> the good are eager for it but the naughty tremble at the sound thereof <\s>
<s> so it was very kind of mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis doubly to spare pen the trouble of hearing or answering letters during his illness <\s>
<s> there could have been nothing in the young man's chest of drawers and wardrobes which could be considered as inculpating him in any way nor any satisfactory documents regarding the fanny bolton affair found there for the widow had to ask her brother in law if he knew anything about the odious transaction and the dreadful intrigue about which her son was engaged <\s>
<s> when they were at richmond one day and pen with warrington had taken a seat on a bench on the terrace the widow kept major pendennis in consultation and laid her terrors and perplexities before him such of them at least for as is the wont of men and women she did not make quite a clean confession and i suppose no spendthrift asked for a schedule of his debts no lady of fashion asked by her husband for her dressmaker's bills ever sent in the whole of them yet such we say of her perplexities at least as she chose to confide to her director for the time being <\s>
<s> when then she asked the major what course she ought to pursue about this dreadful this horrid affair and whether he knew anything regarding it <\s>
<s> the old gentleman puckered up his face so that you could not tell whether he was smiling or not gave the widow one queer look with his little eyes cast them down to the carpet again and said my dear good creature i don't know anything about it and i don't wish to know anything about it and as you ask me my opinion i think you had best know nothing about it too <\s>
<s> young men will be young men begad and my good ma'am if you think our boy is a jo pray spare me this helen broke in looking very stately <\s>
<s> my dear creature i did not commence the conversation permit me to say the major said bowing very blandly <\s>
<s> i can't bear to hear such a sin such a dreadful sin spoken of in such a way the widow said with tears of annoyance starting from her eyes <\s>
<s> i can't bear to think that my boy should commit such a crime <\s>
<s> i wish he had died almost before he had done it <\s>
<s> i don't know how i survive it myself for it is breaking my heart major pendennis to think that his father's son my child whom i remember so good oh so good and full of honour should be fallen so dreadfully low as to as to as to flirt with a little grisette my dear creature <\s>
<s> egad if all the mothers in england were to break their hearts because nay nay upon my word and honour now don't agitate yourself don't cry <\s>
<s> i can't bear to see a woman's tears i never could never <\s>
<s> but how do we know that anything serious has happened <\s>
<s> has arthur said anything <\s>
<s> his silence confirms it sobbed mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis behind her pocket handkerchief <\s>
<s> there are subjects my dear about which a young fellow cannot surely talk to his mamma insinuated the brother in law <\s>
<s> she has written to him cried the lady behind the cambric <\s>
<s> what before he was ill <\s>
<s> no since the mourner with the batiste mask gasped out not before that is i don't think so that is i only since and you have yes i understand <\s>
<s> i suppose when he was too ill to read his own correspondence you took charge of it did you <\s>
<s> i am the most unhappy mother in the world cried out the unfortunate helen <\s>
<s> the most unhappy mother in the world because your son is a man and not a hermit <\s>
<s> have a care my dear sister <\s>
<s> if you have suppressed any letters to him you may have done yourself a great injury and if i know anything of arthur's spirit may cause a difference between him and you which you'll rue all your life a difference that's a dev'lish deal more important my good madam than the little little trumpery cause which originated it <\s>
<s> there was only one letter broke out helen only a very little one only a few words <\s>
<s> here it is oh how can you how can you speak so <\s>
<s> when the good soul said only a very little one the major could not speak at all so inclined was he to laugh in spite of the agonies of the poor soul before him and for whom he had a hearty pity and liking too <\s>
<s> but each was looking at the matter with his or her peculiar eyes and views of morals and the major's morals as the reader knows were not those of an ascetic <\s>
<s> i recommend you he gravely continued if you can to seal it up those letters ain't unfrequently sealed with wafers and to put it amongst pen's other letters and let him have them when he calls for them or if we'll can't seal it we mistook it for a bill <\s>
<s> i can't tell my son a lie said the widow <\s>
<s> it had been put silently into the letter box two days previous to their departure from the temple and had been brought to mrs <\s>
<s> she had never seen fanny's handwriting of course but when the letter was put into her hands she knew the author at once <\s>
<s> she had been on the watch for that letter every day since pen had been ill <\s>
<s> she had opened some of his other letters because she wanted to get at that one <\s>
<s> she had the horrid paper poisoning her bag at that moment <\s>
<s> she took it out and offered it to her brother in law <\s>
<s> arther pendennis esq he read in a timid little sprawling handwriting and with a sneer on his face <\s>
<s> no my dear i won't read any more <\s>
<s> but you who have read it may tell me what the letter contains only prayers for his health in bad spelling you say and a desire to see him <\s>
<s> well there's no harm in that <\s>
<s> and as you ask me here the major began to look a little queer for his own part and put on his demure look as you ask me my dear for information why i don't mind telling you that ah that morgan my man has made some inquiries regarding this affair and that my friend doctor goodenough also looked into it and it appears that this person was greatly smitten with arthur that he paid for her and took her to vauxhall gardens as morgan heard from an old acquaintance of pen's and ours an irish gentleman who was very nearly once having the honour of being the from an irishman in fact that the girl's father a violent man of intoxicated habits has beaten her mother who persists in declaring her daughter's entire innocence to her husband on the one hand while on the other she told goodenough that arthur has acted like a brute to her child <\s>
<s> and so you see the story remains in a mystery <\s>
<s> will you have it cleared up <\s>
<s> i have but to ask pen and he will tell me at once he is as honourable a man as ever lived <\s>
<s> said the widow with bitter scorn <\s>
<s> oh brother what is this you call honour <\s>
<s> if my boy has been guilty he must marry her <\s>
<s> i would go down on my knees and pray him to do so <\s>
<s> screamed out the major and remembering former passages in arthur's history and helen's the truth came across his mind that were helen to make this prayer to her son he would marry the girl he was wild enough and obstinate enough to commit any folly when a woman he loved was in the case <\s>
<s> my dear sister have you lost your senses <\s>
<s> he continued after an agitated pause during which the above dreary reflection crossed him ); and in a softened tone what right have we to suppose that anything has passed between this girl and him <\s>
<s> let's see the letter <\s>
<s> her heart is breaking pray pray write to me home unhappy unkind father your nurse poor little fanny spelt as you say in a manner to outrage all sense of decorum <\s>
<s> my dear what is there in this <\s>
<s> only that the little devil is making love to him still <\s>
<s> why she didn't come into his chambers until he was so delirious that he didn't know her <\s>
<s> what d'you call 'em flanagan the laundress told morgan my man so <\s>
<s> she came in company of an old fellow an old mr <\s>
<s> bows who came most kindly down to stillbrook and brought me away by the way i left him in the cab and never paid the fare and dev'lish kind it was of him <\s>
<s> no there's nothing in the story <\s>
<s> do you think so <\s>
<s> i'll take the letter to arthur and ask him now <\s>
<s> look at him there <\s>
<s> he's on the terrace with mr <\s>
<s> they are talking to some children <\s>
<s> my boy was always fond of children <\s>
<s> he's innocent thank god thank god <\s>
<s> let me go to him <\s>
<s> old pendennis had his own opinion <\s>
<s> when he briskly took the not guilty side of the case but a moment before very likely the old gentleman had a different view from that which he chose to advocate and judged of arthur by what he himself would have done <\s>
<s> if she goes to arthur and he speaks the truth as the rascal will it spoils all he thought <\s>
<s> and he tried one more effort <\s>
<s> my dear good soul he said taking helen's hand and kissing it as your son has not acquainted you with this affair think if you have any right to examine it <\s>
<s> as you believe him to be a man of honour what right have you to doubt his honour in this instance <\s>
<s> who is his accuser <\s>
<s> an anonymous scoundrel who has brought no specific charge against him <\s>
<s> if there were any such wouldn't the girl's parents have come forward <\s>
<s> he is not called upon to rebut nor you to entertain an anonymous accusation and as for believing him guilty because a girl of that rank happened to be in his rooms acting as nurse to him begad you might as well insist upon his marrying that dem'd old irish gin drinking laundress mrs <\s>
<s> the widow burst out laughing through her tears the victory was gained by the old general <\s>
<s> flanagan by ged he continued tapping her slender hand <\s>
<s> the boy has told you nothing about it and you know nothing about it <\s>
<s> the boy is innocent of course <\s>
<s> and what my good soul is the course for us to pursue <\s>
<s> suppose he is attached to this girl don't look sad again it's merely a supposition and begad a young fellow may have an attachment mayn't he directly he gets well he will be at her again <\s>
<s> he must come home <\s>
<s> we must go off directly to fairoaks the widow cried out <\s>
<s> my good creature he'll bore himself to death at fairoaks <\s>
<s> he'll have nothing to do but to think about his passion there <\s>
<s> there's no place in the world for making a little passion into a big one and where a fellow feeds on his own thoughts like a dem'd lonely country house where there's nothing to do <\s>
<s> we must occupy him amuse him we must take him abroad he's never been abroad except to paris for a lark <\s>
<s> we must travel a little <\s>
<s> he must have a nurse with him to take great care of him for goodenough says he had a dev'lish narrow squeak of it don't look frightened and so you must come and watch and i suppose you'll take miss bell and i should like to ask warrington to come <\s>
<s> arthur's dev'lish fond of warrington <\s>
<s> he can't do without warrington <\s>
<s> warrington's family is one of the oldest in england and he is one of the best young fellows i ever met in my life <\s>
<s> i like him exceedingly <\s>
<s> warrington know anything about this this affair <\s>
<s> he had been away i know for two months before it happened pen wrote me so <\s>
<s> not a word i i've asked him about it <\s>
<s> he never heard of the transaction never i pledge you my word cried out the major in some alarm <\s>
<s> and my dear i think you had much best not talk to him about it much best not of course not the subject is most delicate and painful <\s>
<s> the simple widow took her brother's hand and pressed it <\s>
<s> thank you brother she said <\s>
<s> you have been very very kind to me <\s>
<s> you have given me a great deal of comfort <\s>
<s> i'll go to my room and think of what you have said <\s>
<s> this illness and these these emotions have agitated me a great deal and i'm not very strong you know <\s>
<s> but i'll go and thank god that my boy is innocent <\s>
<s> yes my dearest creature yes said the old fellow kissing her affectionately and quite overcome by her tenderness <\s>
<s> he looked after her as she retreated with a fondness which was rendered more piquant as it were by the mixture of a certain scorn which accompanied it <\s>
<s> he said i'd swear till i was black in the face he was innocent rather than give that good soul pain <\s>
<s> having achieved this victory the fatigued and happy warrior laid himself down on the sofa and put his yellow silk pocket handkerchief over his face and indulged in a snug little nap of which the dreams no doubt were very pleasant as he snored with refreshing regularity <\s>
<s> the young men sate meanwhile dawdling away the sunshiny hours on the terrace very happy and pen at least very talkative <\s>
<s> he was narrating to warrington a plan for a new novel and a new tragedy <\s>
<s> warrington laughed at the idea of his writing a tragedy <\s>
<s> by jove he would show that he could and he began to spout some of the lines of his play <\s>
<s> the little solo on the wind instrument which the major was performing was interrupted by the entrance of miss bell <\s>
<s> she had been on a visit to her old friend lady rockminster who had taken a summer villa in the neighbourhood and who hearing of arthur's illness and his mother's arrival at richmond had visited the latter and for the benefit of the former whom she didn't like had been prodigal of grapes partridges and other attentions <\s>
<s> for laura the old lady had a great fondness and longed that she should come and stay with her but laura could not leave her mother at this juncture <\s>
<s> worn out by constant watching over arthur's health helen's own had suffered very considerably and doctor goodenough had had reason to prescribe for her as well as for his younger patient <\s>
<s> old pendennis started up on the entrance of the young lady <\s>
<s> his slumbers were easily broken <\s>
<s> he made her a gallant speech he had been full of gallantry towards her of late <\s>
<s> where had she been gathering those roses which she wore on her cheeks <\s>
<s> how happy he was to be disturbed out of his dreams by such a charming reality <\s>
<s> laura had plenty of humour and honesty and these two caused her to have on her side something very like a contempt for the old gentleman <\s>
<s> it delighted her to draw out his worldlinesses and to make the old habitue of clubs and drawing rooms tell his twaddling tales about great folks and expound his views of morals <\s>
<s> not in this instance however was she disposed to be satirical <\s>
<s> she had been to drive with lady rockminster in the park she said and she had brought home game for pen and flowers for mamma <\s>
<s> she looked very grave about mamma <\s>
<s> she had just been with mrs <\s>
<s> helen was very much worn and she feared she was very very ill <\s>
<s> her large eyes filled with tender marks of the sympathy which she felt in her beloved friend's condition <\s>
<s> she was alarmed about her <\s>
<s> could not that good that dear dr <\s>
<s> arthur's illness and other mental anxiety the major slowly said had no doubt shaken helen <\s>
<s> a burning blush upon the girl's face showed that she understood the old man's allusion <\s>
<s> but she looked him full in the face and made no reply <\s>
<s> he might have spared me that she thought <\s>
<s> what is he aiming at in recalling that shame to me <\s>
<s> that he had an aim in view is very possible <\s>
<s> the old diplomatist seldom spoke without some such end <\s>
<s> doctor goodenough had talked to him he said about their dear friend's health and she wanted rest and change of scene yes change of scene <\s>
<s> painful circumstances which had occurred must be forgotten and never alluded to he begged pardon for even hinting at them to miss bell he never should do so again nor he was sure would she <\s>
<s> everything must be done to soothe and comfort their friend and his proposal was that they should go abroad for the autumn to a watering place in the rhine neighbourhood where helen might rally her exhausted spirits and arthur try and become a new man <\s>
<s> of course laura would not forsake her mother <\s>
<s> it was about helen and helen only that is about arthur too for her sake that laura was anxious <\s>
<s> she would go abroad or anywhere with helen <\s>
<s> and helen having thought the matter over for an hour in her room had by that time grown to be as anxious for the tour as any schoolboy who has been reading a book of voyages is eager to go to sea <\s>
<s> whither should they go <\s>
<s> the farther the better to some place so remote that even recollection could not follow them thither so delightful that pen should never want to leave it anywhere so that he could be happy <\s>
<s> she opened her desk with trembling fingers and took out her banker's book and counted up her little savings <\s>
<s> if more was wanted she had the diamond cross <\s>
<s> she would borrow from laura again <\s>
<s> let us go let us go she thought directly he can bear the journey let us go away <\s>
<s> come kind doctor goodenough come quick and give us leave to quit england <\s>
<s> the good doctor drove over to dine with them that very day <\s>
<s> if you agitate yourself so he said to her and if your heart beats so and if you persist in being so anxious about a young gentleman who is getting well as fast as he can we shall have you laid up and miss laura to watch you and then it will be her turn to be ill and i should like to know how the deuce a doctor is to live who is obliged to come and attend you all for nothing <\s>
<s> goodenough is already jealous of you and says with perfect justice that i fall in love with my patients <\s>
<s> and you must please to get out of the country as soon as ever you can that i may have a little peace in my family <\s>
<s> when the plan of going abroad was proposed it was received by that gentleman with the greatest alacrity and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> he longed to be off at once <\s>
<s> he let his mustachios grow from that very moment in order i suppose that he might get his mouth into training for a perfect french and german pronunciation and he was seriously disquieted in his mind because the mustachios when they came were of a decidedly red colour <\s>
<s> he had looked forward to an autumn at fairoaks and perhaps the idea of passing two or three months there did not amuse the young man <\s>
<s> there is not a soul to speak to in the place he said to warrington <\s>
<s> i can't stand old portman's sermons and pompous after dinner conversation <\s>
<s> i know all old glanders's stories about the peninsular war <\s>
<s> the claverings are the only christian people in the neighbourhood and they are not to be at home before christmas my uncle says besides warrington i want to get out of the country <\s>
<s> whilst you were away confound it i had a temptation from which i am very thankful to have escaped and which i count that even my illness came very luckily to put an end to <\s>
<s> and here he narrated to his friend the circumstances of the vauxhall affair with which the reader is already acquainted <\s>
<s> warrington looked very grave when he heard this story <\s>
<s> putting the moral delinquency out of the question he was extremely glad for arthur's sake that the latter had escaped from a danger which might have made his whole life wretched which certainly said warrington would have occasioned the wretchedness and ruin of the other party <\s>
<s> and your mother and and your friends what a pain it would have been to them <\s>
<s> urged pen's companion little knowing what grief and annoyance these good people had already suffered <\s>
<s> not a word to my mother <\s>
<s> pen cried out in a state of great alarm <\s>
<s> she would never get over it <\s>
<s> an esclandre of that sort would kill her i do believe <\s>
<s> and he added with a knowing air and as if like a young rascal of a lovelace he had been engaged in what are called affaires de coeur all his life the best way when a danger of that sort menaces is not to face it but to turn one's back on it and run <\s>
<s> and were you very much smitten <\s>
<s> she dropped her h's but she was a dear little girl <\s>
<s> o clarissas of this life o you poor little ignorant vain foolish maidens <\s>
<s> if you did but know the way in which the lovelaces speak of you if you could but hear jack talking to tom across the coffee room of a club or see ned taking your poor little letters out of his cigar case and handing them over to charley and billy and harry across the messroom table you would not be so eager to write or so ready to listen <\s>
<s> there's a sort of crime which is not complete unless the lucky rogue boasts of it afterwards and the man who betrays your honour in the first place is pretty sure remember that to betray your secret too <\s>
<s> it's hard to fight and it's easy to fall said warring gloomily <\s>
<s> and as you say pendennis when a danger like this is imminent the best way is to turn your back on it and run <\s>
<s> after this little discourse upon a subject about which pen would have talked a great deal more eloquently a month back the conversation reverted to the plans for going abroad and arthur eagerly pressed his friend to be of the party <\s>
<s> warrington was a part of the family a part of the cure <\s>
<s> arthur said he should not have half the pleasure without warrington <\s>
<s> but george said no he couldn't go <\s>
<s> he must stop at home and take pen's place <\s>
<s> the other remarked that that was needless for shandon was now come back to london and arthur was entitled to a holiday <\s>
<s> don't press me warrington said i can't go <\s>
<s> i'm best at home <\s>
<s> i've not got the money to travel that's the long and short of it for travelling costs money you know <\s>
<s> this little obstacle seemed fatal to pen <\s>
<s> he mentioned it to his mother mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis was very sorry mr <\s>
<s> warrington had been exceedingly kind but she supposed he knew best about his affairs <\s>
<s> and then no doubt she reproached herself for selfishness in wishing to carry the boy off and have him to herself altogether <\s>
<s> what is this i hear from pen my dear mr <\s>
<s> the major asked one day when the pair were alone and after warrington's objection had been stated to him <\s>
<s> not go with us <\s>
<s> we can't hear of such a thing pen won't get well without you <\s>
<s> i promise you i'm not going to be his nurse <\s>
<s> he must have somebody with him that's stronger and gayer and better able to amuse him than a rheumatic old fogy like me <\s>
<s> i shall go to carlsbad very likely when i've seen you people settle down <\s>
<s> travelling costs nothing nowadays or so little <\s>
<s> and and pray warrington remember that i was your father's very old friend and if you and your brother are not on such terms as to to enable you to to anticipate your younger brother's allowance i beg you to make me your banker for hasn't pen been getting into your debt these three weeks past during which you have been doing what he informs me is his work with such exemplary talent and genius begad <\s>
<s> still in spite of this kind offer and unheard of generosity on the part of the major george warrington refused and said he would stay at home <\s>
<s> but it was with a faltering voice and an irresolute accent which showed how much he would like to go though his tongue persisted in saying nay <\s>
<s> but the major's persevering benevolence was not to be baulked in this way <\s>
<s> at the tea table that evening helen happening to be absent from the room for the moment looking for pen who had gone to roost old pendennis returned to the charge and rated warrington for refusing to join in their excursion <\s>
<s> isn't it ungallant miss bell <\s>
<s> he said turning to that young lady <\s>
<s> here we have been the happiest party in the world and this odious selfish creature breaks it up <\s>
<s> miss bell's long eyelashes looked down towards her teacup and warrington blushed hugely but did not speak <\s>
<s> neither did miss bell speak but when he blushed she blushed too <\s>
<s> you ask him to come my dear said the benevolent old gentleman and then perhaps he will listen to you why should mr <\s>
<s> warrington listen to me <\s>
<s> asked the young lady putting the query to her teaspoon seemingly and not to the major <\s>
<s> ask him you have not asked him said pen's artless uncle <\s>
<s> i should be very glad indeed if mr <\s>
<s> warrington would come remarked laura to the teaspoon <\s>
<s> she looked up and said yes <\s>
<s> i will go anywhere you ask me or do anything said george lowly and forcing out the words as if they gave him pain <\s>
<s> old pendennis was delighted the affectionate old creature clapped his hands and cried bravo <\s>
<s> it's a bargain a bargain begad <\s>
<s> shake hands on it young people <\s>
<s> and laura with a look full of tender brightness put out her hand to warrington <\s>
<s> he took hers his face indicated a strange agitation <\s>
<s> he seemed to be about to speak when from pen's neighbouring room helen entered looking at them as the candle which she held lighted her pale frightened face <\s>
<s> laura blushed more red than ever and withdrew her hand <\s>
<s> it's a bargain we have been making my dear creature said the major in his most caressing voice <\s>
<s> we have just bound over mr <\s>
<s> warrington in a promise to come abroad with us <\s>
<s> in which fanny engages a new medical man could helen have suspected that with pen's returning strength his unhappy partiality for little fanny would also reawaken <\s>
<s> though she never spoke a word regarding that young person after her conversation with the major and though to all appearances she utterly ignored fanny's existence yet mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis kept a particularly close watch upon all master arthur's actions on the plea of ill health would scarcely let him out of her sight and was especially anxious that he should be spared the trouble of all correspondence for the present at least <\s>
<s> very likely arthur looked at his own letters with some tremor very likely as he received them at the family table feeling his mother's watch upon him though the good soul's eye seemed fixed upon her teacup or her book he expected daily to see a little handwriting which he would have known though he had never seen it yet and his heart beat as he received the letters to his address <\s>
<s> was he more pleased or annoyed that day after day his expectations were not realised and was his mind relieved that there came no letter from fanny <\s>
<s> though no doubt in these matters when lovelace is tired of clarissa or the contrary it is best for both parties to break at once and each after the failure of the attempt at union to go his own way and pursue his course through life solitary yet our self love or our pity or our sense of decency does not like that sudden bankruptcy <\s>
<s> before we announce to the world that our firm of lovelace and co <\s>
<s> can't meet its engagements we try to make compromises we have mournful meetings of partners we delay the putting up of the shutters and the dreary announcement of the failure <\s>
<s> it must come but we pawn our jewels to keep things going a little longer <\s>
<s> on the whole i dare say pen was rather annoyed that he had no remonstrances from fanny <\s>
<s> could she part from him and never so much as once look round <\s>
<s> could she sink and never once hold a little hand out or cry help arthur <\s>
<s> well well they don't all go down who venture on that voyage <\s>
<s> some few drown when the vessel founders but most are only ducked and scramble to shore <\s>
<s> and the reader's experience of a <\s>
<s> pendennis esquire of the upper temple will enable him to state whether that gentleman belonged to the class of persons who were likely to sink or to swim <\s>
<s> though pen was as yet too weak to walk half a mile and might not on account of his precious health be trusted to take a drive in a carriage by himself and without a nurse in attendance yet helen could not keep watch over mr <\s>
<s> warrington too and had no authority to prevent that gentleman from going to london if business called him thither <\s>
<s> indeed if he had gone and stayed perhaps the widow from reasons of her own would have been glad but she checked these selfish wishes as soon as she ascertained or owned them and remembering warrington's great regard and services and constant friendship for her boy received him as a member of her family almost with her usual melancholy kindness and submissive acquiescence <\s>
<s> yet somehow one morning when his affairs called him to town she divined what warrington's errand was and that he was gone to london to get news about fanny for pen <\s>
<s> indeed arthur had had some talk with his friend and told him more at large what his adventures had been with fanny adventures which the reader knows already and what were his feelings respecting her <\s>
<s> he was very thankful that he had escaped the great danger to which warrington said amen heartily that he had no great fault wherewith to reproach himself in regard of his behaviour to her but that if they parted as they must he would be glad to say a god bless her and to hope that she would remember him kindly <\s>
<s> in his discourse with warrington he spoke upon these matters with so much gravity and so much emotion that george who had pronounced himself most strongly for the separation too began to fear that his friend was not so well cured as he boasted of being and that if the two were to come together again all the danger and the temptation might have to be fought once more <\s>
<s> and with what result <\s>
<s> it is hard to struggle arthur and it is easy to fall warrington said and the best courage for us poor wretches is to fly from danger <\s>
<s> i would not have been what i am now had i practised what i preach <\s>
<s> and what did you practise george <\s>
<s> i knew there was something <\s>
<s> tell us about it warrington <\s>
<s> there was something that can't be mended and that shattered my whole fortunes early warrington answered <\s>
<s> i said i would tell you about it some day pen and will but not now <\s>
<s> take the moral without the fable now pen my boy and if you want to see a man whose whole life has been wrecked by an unlucky rock against which he struck as a boy here he is arthur and so i warn you <\s>
<s> we have shown how mr <\s>
<s> huxter in writing home to his clavering friends mentioned that there was a fashionable club in london of which he was an attendant and that he was there in the habit of meeting an irish officer of distinction who amongst other news had given that intelligence regarding pendennis which the young surgeon had transmitted to clavering <\s>
<s> this club was no other than the back kitchen where the disciple of saint bartholomew was accustomed to meet the general the peculiarities of whose brogue appearance disposition and general conversation greatly diverted many young gentlemen who used the back kitchen as a place of nightly entertainment and refreshment <\s>
<s> huxter who had a fine natural genius for mimicking everything whether it was a favourite tragic or comic actor or a cock on a dunghill a corkscrew going into a bottle and a cork issuing thence or an irish officer of genteel connexions who offered himself as an object of imitation with only too much readiness talked his talk and twanged his poor old long bow whenever drink a hearer and an opportunity occurred studied our friend the general with peculiar gusto and drew the honest fellow out many a night <\s>
<s> a bait consisting of sixpennyworth of brandy and water the worthy old man was sure to swallow and under the influence of this liquor who was more happy than he to tell his stories of his daughter's triumphs and his own in love war drink and polite society <\s>
<s> thus huxter was enabled to present to his friends many pictures of costigan of costigan fighting a jewel in the phaynix of costigan and his interview with the juke of york of costigan at his sonunlaw's teeble surrounded by the nobilitee of his countree of costigan when crying drunk at which time he was in the habit of confidentially lamenting his daughter's ingratichewd and stating that his grey hairs were hastening to a praymachure greeve <\s>
<s> and thus our friend was the means of bringing a number of young fellows to the back kitchen who consumed the landlord's liquors whilst they relished the general's peculiarities so that mine host pardoned many of the latter's foibles in consideration of the good which they brought to his house <\s>
<s> not the highest position in life was this certainly or one which if we had a reverence for an old man we would be anxious that he should occupy but of this aged buffoon it may be mentioned that he had no particular idea that his condition of life was not a high one and that in his whiskied blood there was not a black drop nor in his muddled brains a bitter feeling against any mortal being <\s>
<s> even his child his cruel emily he would have taken to his heart and forgiven with tears and what more can one say of the christian charity of a man than that he is actually ready to forgive those who have done him every kindness and with whom he is wrong in a dispute <\s>
<s> there was some idea amongst the young men who frequented the back kitchen and made themselves merry with the society of captain costigan that the captain made a mystery regarding his lodgings for fear of duns or from a desire of privacy and lived in some wonderful place <\s>
<s> nor would the landlord of the premises when questioned upon this subject answer any inquiries his maxim being that he only knew gentlemen who frequented that room in that room that when they quitted that room having paid their scores as gentlemen and behaved as gentlemen his communication with them ceased and that as a gentleman himself he thought it was only impertinent curiosity to ask where any other gentleman lived <\s>
<s> costigan in his most intoxicated and confidential moments also evaded any replies to questions or hints addressed to him on this subject there was no particular secret about it as we have seen who have had more than once the honour of entering his apartments but in the vicissitudes of a long life he had been pretty often in the habit of residing in houses where privacy was necessary to his comfort and where the appearance of some visitors would have brought him anything but pleasure <\s>
<s> hence all sorts of legends were formed by wags or credulous persons respecting his place of abode <\s>
<s> it was stated that he slept habitually in a watch box in the city in a cab at a mews where a cab proprietor gave him a shelter in the duke of york's column etc the wildest of these theories being put abroad by the facetious and imaginative huxter <\s>
<s> for huxey when not silenced by the company of swells and when in the society of his own friends was a very different fellow to the youth whom we have seen cowed by pen's impertinent airs and adored by his family at home was the life and soul of the circle whom he met either round the festive board or the dissecting table <\s>
<s> on one brilliant september morning as huxter was regaling himself with a cup of coffee at a stall in covent garden having spent a delicious night dancing at vauxhall he spied the general reeling down henrietta street with a crowd of hooting blackguard boys at his heels who had left their beds under the arches of the river betimes and were prowling about already for breakfast and the strange livelihood of the day <\s>
<s> the poor old general was not in that condition when the sneers and jokes of these young beggars had much effect upon him the cabmen and watermen at the cabstand knew him and passed their comments upon him the policemen gazed after him and warned the boys off him with looks of scorn and pity what did the scorn and pity of men the jokes of ribald children matter to the general <\s>
<s> he reeled along the street with glazed eyes having just sense enough to know whither he was bound and to pursue his accustomed beat homewards <\s>
<s> he went to bed not knowing how he had reached it as often as any man in london <\s>
<s> he woke and found himself there and asked no questions and he was tacking about on this daily though perilous voyage when from his station at the coffee stall huxter spied him <\s>
<s> to note his friend to pay his twopence indeed he had but eightpence left or he would have had a cab from vauxhall to take him home was with the eager huxter the work of an instant costigan dived down the alleys by drury lane theatre where gin shops oyster shops and theatrical wardrobes abound the proprietors of which were now asleep behind their shutters as the pink morning lighted up their chimneys and through these courts huxter followed the general until he reached oldcastle street in which is the gate of shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> here just as he was within sight of home a luckless slice of orange peel came between the general's heel and the pavement and caused the poor old fellow to fall backwards <\s>
<s> huxter ran up to him instantly and after a pause during which the veteran giddy with his fall and his previous whisky gathered as he best might his dizzy brains together the young surgeon lifted up the limping general and very kindly and good naturedly offered to conduct him to his home <\s>
<s> for some time and in reply to the queries which the student of medicine put to him the muzzy general refused to say where his lodgings were and declared that they were hard by and that he could reach them without difficulty and he disengaged himself from huxter's arm and made a rush as if to get to his own home unattended but he reeled and lurched so that the young surgeon insisted upon accompanying him and with many soothing expressions and cheering and consolatory phrases succeeded in getting the general's dirty old hand under what he called his own fin and led the old fellow moaning piteously across the street <\s>
<s> he stopped when he came to the ancient gate ornamented with the armorial bearings of the venerable shepherd <\s>
<s> here tis said he drawing up at the portal and he made a successful pull at the gate bell which presently brought out old mr <\s>
<s> bolton the porter scowling fiercely and grumbling as he was used to do every morning when it became his turn to let in that early bird <\s>
<s> costigan tried to hold bolton for a moment in genteel conversation but the other surlily would not <\s>
<s> don't bother me said he go to your hown bed capting and don't keep honest men out of theirs <\s>
<s> so the captain tacked across the square and reached his own staircase up which he stumbled with the worthy huxter at his heels <\s>
<s> costigan had a key of his own which huxter inserted into the keyhole for him so that there was no need to call up little mr <\s>
<s> bows from the sleep into which the old musician had not long since fallen and huxter having aided to disrobe his tipsy patient and ascertained that no bones were broken helped him to bed and applied compresses an water to one of his knees and shins which with the pair of trousers which encased them costigan had severely torn in his fall <\s>
<s> at the general's age and with his habit of body such wounds as he had inflicted on himself are slow to heal a good deal of inflammation ensued and the old fellow lay ill for some days suffering both pain and fever <\s>
<s> huxter undertook the case of his interesting patient with great confidence and alacrity and conducted it with becoming skill <\s>
<s> he visited his friend day after day and consoled him with lively rattle and conversation for the absence of the society which costigan needed and of which he was an ornament and he gave special instructions to the invalid's nurse about the quantity of whisky which the patient was to take instructions which as the poor old fellow could not for many days get out of his bed or sofa himself he could not by any means infringe <\s>
<s> bolton and our little friend fanny when able to do so officiated at the general's bedside and the old warrior was made as comfortable as possible under his calamity <\s>
<s> thus huxter whose affable manners and social turn made him quickly intimate with persons in whose society he fell and whose over refinement did not lead them to repulse the familiarities of this young gentleman became pretty soon intimate in shepherd's inn both with our acquaintances in the garrets and those in the porter's lodge <\s>
<s> he thought he had seen fanny somewhere he felt certain that he had but it is no wonder that he should not accurately remember her for the poor little thing never chose to tell him where she had met him he himself had seen her at a period when his own views both of persons and of right and wrong were clouded by the excitement of drinking and dancing and also little fanny was very much changed and worn by the fever and agitation and passion and despair which the past three weeks had poured upon the head of that little victim <\s>
<s> borne down was the head now and very pale and wan the face and many and many a time the sad eyes had looked into the postman's as he came to the inn and the sickened heart had sunk as he passed away <\s>
<s> costigan's accident occurred fanny was rather glad to have an opportunity of being useful and doing something kind something that would make her forget her own little sorrows perhaps she felt she bore them better whilst she did her duty though i dare say many a tear dropped into the old irishman's gruel <\s>
<s> stir the gruel well and have courage little fanny <\s>
<s> if everybody who has suffered from your complaint were to die of it straightway what a fine year the undertakers would have <\s>
<s> whether from compassion for his only patient or delight in his society mr <\s>
<s> huxter found now occasion to visit costigan two or three times in the day at least and if any of the members of the porter's lodge family were not in attendance on the general the young doctor was sure to have some particular directions to address to those at their own place of habitation <\s>
<s> he was a kind fellow he made or purchased toys for the children he brought them apples and brandy balls he brought a mask and frightened them with it and caused a smile upon the face of pale fanny <\s>
<s> b and was very intimate familiar and facetious with that lady quite different from that aughty artless beast as mrs <\s>
<s> bolton now denominated a certain young gentleman of our acquaintance and whom she now vowed she never could abear <\s>
<s> it was from this lady who was very free in her conversation that huxter presently learnt what was the illness which was evidently preying upon little fan and what had been pen's behaviour regarding her <\s>
<s> bolton's account of the transaction was not it may be imagined entirely an impartial narrative <\s>
<s> one would have thought from her story that the young gentleman had employed a course of the most persevering and flagitious artifices to win the girl's heart had broken the most solemn promises made to her and was a wretch to be hated and chastised by every champion of woman <\s>
<s> huxter in his present frame of mind respecting arthur and suffering under the latter's contumely was ready of course to take all for granted that was said in the disfavour of this unfortunate convalescent <\s>
<s> but why did he not write home to clavering as he had done previously giving an account of pen's misconduct and of the particulars regarding it which had now come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> he soon in a letter to his brother in law announced that that nice young man mr <\s>
<s> pendennis had escaped narrowly from a fever and that no doubt all clavering where he was so popular would be pleased at his recovery and he mentioned that he had an interesting case of compound fracture an officer of distinction which kept him in town but as for fanny bolton he made no more mention of her in his letters no more than pen himself had made mention of her <\s>
<s> o you mothers at home how much do you think you know about your lads <\s>
<s> how much do you think you know <\s>
<s> but with bows there was no reason why huxter should not speak his mind and so a very short time after his conversation with mrs <\s>
<s> sam talked to the musician about his early acquaintance with pendennis described him as a confounded conceited blackguard and expressed a determination to punch his impudent head as soon as ever he should be well enough to stand up like a man <\s>
<s> then it was that bows on his part spoke and told his version of the story whereof arthur and little fan were the hero and heroine how they had met by no contrivance of the former but by a blunder of the old irishman now in bed with a broken shin how pen had acted with manliness and self control in the business how mrs bolton was an idiot and he related the conversation which he bows had had with pen and the sentiments uttered by the young man <\s>
<s> perhaps bow's story caused some twinges of conscience in the breast of pen's accuser and that gentleman frankly owned that he had been wrong with regard to arthur and withdrew his project for punching mr <\s>
<s> but the cessation of his hostility for pen did not diminish huxter's attentions to fanny which unlucky mr bows marked with his usual jealousy and bitterness of spirit i have but to like anybody the old fellow thought and somebody is sure to come and be preferred to me <\s>

<s> i've played a second fiddle through life he said with a bitter laugh how can i suppose the luck is to change after it has gone against me so long <\s>
<s> this was the selfish way in which bows looked at the state of affairs though few persons would have thought there was any cause for his jealousy who looked at the pale and grief stricken countenance of the hapless little girl its object <\s>
<s> fanny received huxter's good natured efforts at consolation and kind attentions kindly <\s>
<s> she laughed now and again at his jokes and games with her little sisters but relapsed quickly into a dejection which ought to have satisfied mr <\s>
<s> bows that the new comer had no place in her heart as yet had jealous mr <\s>
<s> bows been enabled to see with clear eyes <\s>

<s> warrington was of course directed to the musician's chambers and found him tending the patient there from whose chamber he came out to wait upon his guest <\s>
<s> we have said that they had been previously known to one another and the pair shook hands with sufficient cordiality <\s>
<s> after a little preliminary talk warrington said that he had come from his friend arthur pendennis and from his family to thank bows for his attention at the commencement of pen's illness and for his kindness in hastening into the country to fetch the major <\s>
<s> bows replied that it was but his duty he had never thought to have seen the young gentleman alive again when he went in search of pen's relatives and he was very glad of mr <\s>

<s> it was from mr <\s>
<s> huxter that bows had learned pen's parentage no doubt and if he took pen's part against the young surgeon and fanny's against mr <\s>
<s> pendennis it was because the old gentleman was in so savage a mood that his humour was to contradict everybody <\s>
<s> warrington was curious and not ill pleased at the musician's taunts and irascibility <\s>
<s> i never heard of these transactions he said or got but a very imperfect account of them from major pendennis <\s>
<s> what was a lady to do <\s>
<s> i think i have never spoken with her on the subject she had some notion that the young woman and my friend pen were on on terms of of an intimacy which mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis could not of course recognise oh of course not sir <\s>

<s> if you want news about miss fanny you must ask at the doctor's shop sir not of an old fiddler like me good bye sir <\s>

<s> are all women like that <\s>

<s> at piccadilly waiting for the richmond omnibus george fell in with major pendennis bound in the same direction and he told the old gentleman of what he had seen and heard respecting fanny <\s>
<s> major pendennis was highly delighted and as might be expected of such a philosopher made precisely the same observation as that which had escaped from warrington <\s>
<s> all women are the same he said <\s>
<s> la petite se console <\s>
<s> daymy when i used to read telemaque at school calypso ne pouvait se consoler you know the rest warrington i used to say it was absard <\s>

<s> and so she's got a new soupirant has she the little porteress <\s>
<s> dayvlish nice little girl <\s>
<s> how mad pen will be eh warrington <\s>
<s> but we must break it to him gently or he'll be in such a rage that he will be going after her again <\s>
<s> we must menager the young fellow <\s>
<s> pendennis ought to know that pen acted very well in the business <\s>
<s> she evidently thinks him guilty and according to mr <\s>
<s> bows arthur behaved like a good fellow warrington said <\s>
<s> my dear warrington said the major with a look of some alarm in mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis's agitated state of health and that sort of thing the best way i think is not to say a single word about the subject or stay leave it to me and i'll talk to her break it to her gently you know and that sort of thing <\s>
<s> i give you my word i will <\s>
<s> and so calypso's consoled is she and he sniggered over this gratifying truth happy in the corner of the omnibus during the rest of the journey <\s>
<s> pen was very anxious to hear from his envoy what had been the result of the latter's mission and as soon as the two young men could be alone the ambassador spoke in reply to arthur's eager queries <\s>
<s> you remember your poem pen of ariadne in naxos warrington said devilish bad poetry it was to be sure <\s>
<s> asked pen in a great state of excitement <\s>
<s> when theseus left ariadne do you remember what happened to her young fellow <\s>
<s> it's a lie it's a lie <\s>
<s> you don't mean that <\s>
<s> cried out pen starting up his face turning red <\s>
<s> sit down stoopid warrington said and with two fingers pushed pen back into his seat again <\s>
<s> it's better for you as it is young one he said sadly in reply to the savage flush in arthur's face <\s>
<s> foreign ground worthy major pendennis fulfilled his promise to warrington so far as to satisfy his own conscience and in so far to ease poor helen with regard to her son as to make her understand that all connexion between arthur and the odious little gatekeeper was at an end and that she need have no further anxiety with respect to an imprudent attachment or a degrading marriage on pen's part <\s>
<s> and that young fellow's mind was also relieved after he had recovered the shock to his vanity by thinking that miss fanny was not going to die of love for him and that no unpleasant consequences were to be apprehended from the luckless and brief connexion <\s>
<s> so the whole party were free to carry into effect their projected continental trip and arthur pendennis rentier voyageant avec madame pendennis and mademoiselle bell and george warrington particulier age de 32 ans taille 6 pieds anglais figure ordinaire cheveux noirs barbe idem etc procured passports from the consul of h m <\s>

<s> barefooted friars in the streets crowned images of saints and virgins in the churches before which people were bowing down and worshipping in direct defiance as she held of the written law priests in gorgeous robes or lurking in dark confessionals theatres opened and people dancing on sundays all these new sights and manners shocked and bewildered the simple country lady and when the young men after their evening drive or walk returned to the widow and her adopted daughter they found their books of devotion on the table and at their entrance laura would commonly cease reading some of the psalms or the sacred pages which of all others helen loved <\s>
<s> the late events connected with her son had cruelly shaken her laura watched with intense though hidden anxiety every movement of her dearest friend and poor pen was most constant and affectionate in waiting upon his mother whose wounded bosom yearned with love towards him though there was a secret between them and an anguish or rage almost on the mother's part to think that she was dispossessed somehow of her son's heart or that there were recesses in it which she must not or dared not enter <\s>
<s> she sickened as she thought of the sacred days of boyhood when it had not been so when her arthur's heart had no secrets and she was his all in all when he poured his hopes and pleasures his childish griefs vanities triumphs into her willing and tender embrace when her home was his nest still and before fate selfishness nature had driven him forth on wayward wings to range his own flight to sing his own song and to seek his own home and his own mate <\s>
<s> watching this devouring care and racking disappointment in her friend laura once said to helen if pen had loved me as you wished i should have gained him but i should have lost you mamma i know i should and i like you to love me best <\s>
<s> men do not know what it is to love as we do i think and helen sighing agreed to this portion of the young lady's speech though she protested against the former part <\s>

<s> he himself was bound on a brief visit to the house of a great man a friend of his after which sojourn he proposed to join his sister in law at the german watering place whither the party was bound <\s>
<s> the major himself thought that his long attentions to his sick family had earned for him a little relaxation and though the best of the partridges were thinned off the pheasants were still to be shot at stillbrook where the noble owner still was old pendennis betook himself to that hospitable mansion and disported there with great comfort to himself <\s>
<s> a royal duke some foreigners of note some illustrious statesmen and some pleasant people visited it it did the old fellow's heart good to see his name in the morning post amongst the list of the distinguished company which the marquis of steyne was entertaining at his country house at stillbrook <\s>
<s> he was a very useful and pleasant personage in a country house <\s>
<s> he entertained the young men with queer little anecdotes and grivoises stories on their shooting parties or in their smoking room where they laughed at him and with him <\s>
<s> he was obsequious with the ladies of a morning in the rooms dedicated to them <\s>
<s> he walked the new arrivals about the park and gardens and showed them the carte du pays and where there was the best view of the mansion and where the most favourable point to look at the lake he showed where the timber was to be felled and where the old road went before the new bridge was built and the hill cut down and where the place in the wood was where old lord lynx discovered sir phelim o'neal on his knees before her ladyship etc <\s>
<s> etc he called the lodge keepers and gardeners by their names he knew the number of domestics that sat down in the housekeeper's room and how many dined in the servants' hall he had a word for everybody and about everybody and a little against everybody <\s>
<s> he was invaluable in a country house in a word and richly merited and enjoyed his vacation after his labours <\s>
<s> and perhaps whilst he was thus deservedly enjoying himself with his country friends the major was not ill pleased at transferring to warrington the command of the family expedition to the continent and thus perforce keeping him in the service of the ladies a servitude which george was only too willing to undergo for his friend's sake and for that of a society which he found daily more delightful <\s>
<s> warrington was a good german scholar and was willing to give miss laura lessons in the language who was very glad to improve herself though pen for his part was too weak or lazy now to resume his german studies <\s>

<s> so warrington selfishly devoted himself to helen who selfishly devoted herself to pen who selfishly devoted himself to himself at this present period having no other personage or object to occupy him except indeed his mother's health which gave him a serious and real disquiet but though they sate together they did not talk much and the cloud was always between them <\s>

<s> he pointed out the russians and spaniards gambling for heaps of gold and denounced their eagerness as something sordid and barbarous an english gentleman should play where the fashion is play but should not elate or depress himself at the sport and he told how he had seen his friend the marquis of steyne when lord gaunt lose eighteen thousand at a sitting and break the bank three nights running at paris without ever showing the least emotion at his defeat or victory <\s>
<s> and that's what i call being an english gentleman pen my dear boy the old gentleman said warming as he prattled about his recollections what i call the great manner only remains with us and with a few families in france <\s>
<s> and as russian princesses passed him whose reputation had long ceased to be doubtful and damaged english ladies who are constantly seen in company of their faithful attendant for the time being in these gay haunts of dissipation the old major with eager garrulity and mischievous relish told his nephew wonderful particulars regarding the lives of these heroines and diverted the young man with a thousand scandals <\s>
<s> egad he felt himself quite young again he remarked to pen as rouged and grinning her enormous chasseur behind her bearing her shawl the princess obstropski smiled and recognised and accosted him <\s>
<s> he remembered her in 14 when she was an actress of the paris boulevard and the emperor alexander's aide de camp obstropski a man of great talents who knew a good deal about the emperor paul's death and was a devil to play married her <\s>
<s> he most courteously and respectfully asked leave to call upon the princess and to present to her his nephew mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis and he pointed out to the latter a half dozen of other personages whose names were as famous and whose histories were as satisfying <\s>
<s> what would poor helen have thought could she have heard those tales or known to what kind of people her brother in law was presenting her son <\s>
<s> only once leaning on arthur's arm she had passed through the room where the green tables were prepared for play and the croaking croupiers were calling out their fatal words of rouge gagne and couleur perd <\s>
<s> she had shrunk terrified out of the pandemonium imploring pen extorting from him a promise on his word of honour that he would never play at those tables and the scene which so frightened the simple widow only amused the worldly old veteran and made him young again <\s>
<s> he could breathe the air cheerfully which stifled her <\s>
<s> her right was not his right his food was her poison <\s>
<s> human creatures are constituted thus differently and with this variety the marvellous world is peopled <\s>
<s> to the credit of mr <\s>
<s> pen let it be said that he kept honestly the promise made to his mother and stoutly told his uncle of his intention to abide by it <\s>
<s> when the major arrived his presence somehow cast a damp upon at least three of the persons of our little party upon laura who had anything but respect for him upon warrington whose manner towards him showed an involuntary haughtiness and contempt and upon the timid and alarmed widow who dreaded lest he should interfere with her darling though almost desperate projects for her boy <\s>
<s> and indeed the major unknown to himself was the bearer of tidings which were to bring about a catastrophe in the affairs of all our friends <\s>
<s> pen with his two ladies had apartments in the town of rosenbad honest warrington had lodgings hard by the major on arrival at rosenbad had as befitted his dignity taken his quarters at one of the great hotels at the roman emperor or the four seasons where two or three hundred gamblers pleasure seekers or invalids sate down and over ate themselves daily at the enormous table d'hote <\s>
<s> to this hotel pen went on the morning after the major's arrival dutifully to pay his respects to his uncle and found the latter's sitting room duly prepared and arranged by mr <\s>
<s> morgan with the major's hats brushed and his coats laid out his despatch boxes and umbrella cases his guidebooks passports maps and other elaborate necessaries of the english traveller all as trim and ready as they could be in their master's own room in jermyn street <\s>
<s> everything was ready from the medicine bottle fresh filled from the pharmacien's down to the old fellow's prayer book without which he never travelled for he made a point of appearing at the english church at every place which he honoured with a stay everybody did it he said every english gentleman did it and this pious man would as soon have thought of not calling upon the english ambassador in a continental town as of not showing himself at the national place of worship <\s>
<s> the old gentleman had been to take one of the baths for which rosenbad is famous and which everybody takes and his after bath toilet was not yet completed when pen arrived <\s>
<s> the elder called out to arthur in a cheery voice from the inner apartment in which he and morgan were engaged and the valet presently came in bearing a little packet to pen's address mr <\s>
<s> arthur's letters and papers morgan said which he had brought from mr <\s>
<s> arthur's chambers in london and which consisted chiefly of numbers of the pall mall gazette which our friend mr <\s>
<s> finucane thought his collaborateur would like to see <\s>
<s> the papers were tied together the letters in an envelope addressed to pen in the last named gentleman's handwriting <\s>
<s> amongst the letters there was a little note addressed as a former letter we have heard of had been to arther pendennis esquire which arthur opened with a start and a blush and read with a very keen pang of interest and sorrow and regard <\s>
<s> she had come to arthur's house fanny bolton said and found that he was gone gone away to germany without ever leaving a word for her or answer to her last letter in which she prayed but for one word of kindness or the books which he had promised her in happier times before he was ill and which she should like to keep in remembrance of him <\s>
<s> she said she would not reproach those who had found her at his bedside when he was in the fever and knew nobody and who had turned the poor girl away without a word <\s>
<s> she thought she should have died she said of that but doctor goodenough had kindly tended her and kept her life when perhaps the keeping of it was of no good and she forgave everybody and as for arthur she would pray for him for ever <\s>
<s> and when he was so ill and they cut off his hair she had made so free as to keep one little lock for herself and that she owned <\s>
<s> and might she still keep it or would his mamma order that that should be gave up too <\s>
<s> she was willing to obey him in all things and couldn't but remember that once he was so kind oh <\s>
<s> so good and kind <\s>
<s> to his poor fanny <\s>
<s> when major pendennis fresh and smirking from his toilet came out of his bedroom to his sitting room he found arthur with this note before him and an expression of savage anger on his face which surprised the elder gentleman <\s>
<s> what news from london my boy <\s>
<s> he rather faintly asked are the duns at you that you look so glum <\s>
<s> do you know anything about this letter sir <\s>
<s> what letter my good sir <\s>
<s> said the other dryly at once perceiving what had happened <\s>
<s> you know what i mean about about miss about fanny bolton the poor dear little girl arthur broke out <\s>
<s> when she was in my room <\s>
<s> was she there when i was delirious i fancied she was was she <\s>
<s> who sent her out of my chambers <\s>
<s> who intercepted her letters to me <\s>
<s> who dared to do it <\s>
<s> did you do it uncle <\s>
<s> it's not my practice to tamper with gentlemen's letters or to answer damned impertinent questions major pendennis cried out in a great tremor of emotion and indignation <\s>
<s> there was a girl in your rooms when i came up at great personal inconvenience daymy and to meet with a return of this kind for my affection to you is not pleasant by gad sir not at all pleasant <\s>
<s> that's not the question sir arthur said hotly and i beg your pardon uncle <\s>
<s> you were you always have been most kind to me but i say again did you say anything harsh to this poor girl <\s>
<s> did you send her away from me <\s>
<s> i never spoke a word to the girl the uncle said and i never sent her away from you and know no more about her and wish to know no more about her than about the man in the moon <\s>
<s> then it's my mother that did it arthur broke out <\s>
<s> did my mother send that poor child away <\s>
<s> i repeat i know nothing about it sir the elder said testily <\s>
<s> let's change the subject if you please <\s>
<s> i'll never forgive the person who did it said arthur bouncing up and seizing his hat <\s>
<s> the major cried out stop arthur for god's sake stop but before he had uttered his sentence arthur had rushed out of the room and at the next minute the major saw him striding rapidly down the street that led towards his home <\s>
<s> said the old fellow to morgan and he wagged his head and sighed as he looked out of the window <\s>
<s> there'll be a row <\s>
<s> i knew there would and begad all the fat's in the fire <\s>
<s> when pen reached home he only found warrington in the ladies drawing room waiting their arrival in order to conduct them to the room where the little english colony at rosenbad held their sunday church <\s>
<s> helen and laura had not appeared as yet the former was ailing and her daughter was with her <\s>
<s> pen's wrath was so great that he could not defer expressing it <\s>
<s> he flung fanny's letter across the table to his friend <\s>
<s> look there warrington he said she tended me in my illness she rescued me out of the jaws of death and this is the way they have treated the dear little creature <\s>
<s> they have kept her letters from me they have treated me like a child and her like a dog poor thing <\s>
<s> my mother has done this <\s>
<s> if she has you must remember it is your mother warrington interposed <\s>
<s> it only makes the crime the greater because it is she who has done it pen answered <\s>
<s> she ought to have been the poor girl's defender not her enemy she ought to go down on her knees and ask pardon of her <\s>
<s> i am shocked at the cruelty which has been shown her <\s>
<s> she gave me her all and this is her return <\s>
<s> she sacrifices everything for me and they spurn her <\s>
<s> said warrington they can hear you from the next room <\s>
<s> pen cried out only so much the louder <\s>
<s> those may overhear my talk who intercept my letters <\s>
<s> i say this poor girl has been shamefully used and i will do my best to right her i will <\s>
<s> the door of the neighbouring room opened and laura came forth with a pale and stern face <\s>
<s> she looked at pen with glances from which beamed pride defiance aversion <\s>
<s> arthur your mother is very ill she said it is a pity that you should speak so loud as to disturb her <\s>
<s> it is a pity that i should have been obliged to speak at all pen answered <\s>
<s> and i have more to say before i have done <\s>
<s> i should think what you have to say will hardly be fit for me to hear laura said haughtily <\s>
<s> you are welcome to hear it or not as you like said mr <\s>
<s> i shall go in now and speak to my mother <\s>
<s> laura came rapidly forward so that she should not be overheard by her friend within <\s>
<s> not now sir she said to pen <\s>
<s> you may kill her if you do <\s>
<s> your conduct has gone far enough to make her wretched <\s>
<s> cried out pen in a fury <\s>
<s> who dares impugn it <\s>
<s> who dares meddle with me <\s>
<s> is it you who are the instigator of this persecution <\s>
<s> i said before it was a subject of which it did not become me to hear or to speak laura said <\s>
<s> but as for mamma if she had acted otherwise than she did with regard to to the person about whom you seem to take such an interest it would have been i that must have quitted your house and not that that person <\s>
<s> this is too much pen cried out with a violent execration <\s>
<s> perhaps that is what you wished laura said tossing her head up <\s>
<s> no more of this if you please i am not accustomed to hear such subjects spoken of in such language and with a stately curtsey the young lady passed to her room looking her adversary full in the face as she retreated and closed the door upon him <\s>
<s> pen was bewildered with wonder perplexity fury at this monstrous and unreasonable persecution <\s>
<s> he burst out into a loud and bitter laugh as laura quitted him and with sneers and revilings as a man who jeers under an operation ridiculed at once his own pain and his persecutor's anger <\s>
<s> the laugh which was one of bitter humour and no unmanly or unkindly expression of suffering under most cruel and unmerited torture was heard in the next apartment as some of his unlucky previous expressions had been and like them entirely misinterpreted by the hearers <\s>
<s> it struck like a dagger into the wounded and tender heart of helen it pierced laura and inflamed the high spirited girl with scorn and anger <\s>
<s> and it was to this hardened libertine she thought to this boaster of low intrigues that i had given my heart away <\s>
<s> he breaks the most sacred laws thought helen <\s>
<s> he prefers the creature of his passion to his own mother and when he is upbraided he laughs and glories in his crime <\s>
<s> she gave me her all i heard him say it argued the poor widow and he boasts of it and laughs and breaks his mother's heart <\s>
<s> the emotion the shame the grief the mortification almost killed her <\s>
<s> she felt she should die of his unkindness <\s>
<s> warrington thought of laura's speech perhaps that is what you wished <\s>
<s> she loves pen still he said <\s>
<s> it was jealousy made her speak come away pen <\s>
<s> come away and let us go to church and get calm <\s>
<s> you must explain this matter to your mother <\s>
<s> she does not appear to know the truth nor do you quite my good fellow <\s>
<s> come away and let us talk about it <\s>
<s> and again he muttered to himself perhaps that is what you wished <\s>
<s> yes she loves him <\s>
<s> why shouldn't she love him <\s>
<s> whom else would i have her love <\s>
<s> what can she be to me but the dearest and the fairest and the best of women <\s>
<s> so leaving the women similarly engaged within the two gentlemen walked away each occupied with his own thought and silent for a considerable space <\s>
<s> i must set this matter right thought honest george as she loves him still i must set his mind right about the other woman <\s>
<s> and with this charitable thought the good fellow began to tell more at large what bows had said to him regarding miss bolton's behaviour and fickleness and he described how the girl was no better than a little light minded flirt and perhaps he exaggerated the good humour and contentedness which he had himself as he thought witnessed in her behaviour in the scene with mr <\s>
<s> now all bows's statements had been coloured by an insane jealousy and rage on that old man's part and instead of allaying pen's renascent desire to see his little conquest again warrington's accounts inflamed and angered pendennis and made him more anxious than before to set himself right as he persisted in phrasing it with fanny <\s>
<s> they arrived at the church door presently but scarce one word of the service and not a syllable of mr <\s>
<s> shamble's sermon did either of them comprehend probably so much was each engaged with his own private speculations <\s>
<s> the major came up to them after the service with his well brushed hat and wig and his jauntiest most cheerful air <\s>
<s> he complimented them upon being seen at church again he said that every comme il faut person made a point of attending the english service abroad and he walked back with the young men prattling to them in garrulous good humour and making bows to his acquaintances as they passed and thinking innocently that pen and george were both highly delighted by his anecdotes which they suffered to run on in a scornful and silent acquiescence <\s>
<s> at the time of mr <\s>
<s> shamble's sermon an erratic anglican divine hired for the season at places of english resort and addicted to debts drinking and even to roulette it was said pen chafing under the persecution which his womankind inflicted upon him had been meditating a great act of revolt and of justice as he had worked himself up to believe and warrington on his part had been thinking that a crisis in his affairs had likewise come and that it was necessary for him to break away from a connexion which every day made more and more wretched and dear to him <\s>
<s> yes the time was come <\s>
<s> he took those fatal words perhaps that is what you wished as a text for a gloomy homily which he preached to himself in the dark pew of his own heart whilst mr <\s>
<s> shamble was feebly giving utterance to his sermon <\s>
<s> fairoaks to let our poor widow with the assistance of her faithful martha of fairoaks who laughed and wondered at the german ways and superintend the affairs of the simple household had made a little feast in honour of major pendennis's arrival of which however only the major and his two younger friends partook for helen sent to say that she was too unwell to dine at their table and laura bore her company <\s>
<s> the major talked for the party and did not perceive or choose to perceive what a gloom and silence pervaded the other two sharers of the modest dinner <\s>
<s> it was evening before helen and laura came into the sitting room to join the company there <\s>
<s> she came in leaning on laura with her back to the waning light so that arthur could not see how pallid and woe stricken her face was and as she went up to pen whom she had not seen during the day and placed her fond arms on his shoulders and kissed him tenderly laura left her and moved away to another part of the room <\s>
<s> pen remarked that his mother's voice and her whole frame trembled her hand was clammy cold as she put it up to his forehead piteously embracing him <\s>
<s> the spectacle of her misery only added somehow to the wrath and testiness of the young man <\s>
<s> he scarcely returned the kiss which the suffering lady gave him and the countenance with which he met the appeal of her look was hard and cruel <\s>
<s> she persecutes me he thought within himself and she comes to me with the air of a martyr <\s>
<s> you look very ill my child she said <\s>
<s> i don't like to see you look in that way <\s>
<s> and she tottered to a sofa still holding one of his passive hands in her thin cold clinging fingers <\s>
<s> i have had much to annoy me mother pen said with a throbbing breast and as he spoke helen's heart began to beat so that she sate almost dead and speechless with terror <\s>
<s> warrington laura and major pendennis all remained breathless aware that the storm was about to break <\s>
<s> i have had letters from london arthur continued and one that has given me more pain than i ever had in my life <\s>
<s> it tells me that former letters of mine have been intercepted and purloined away from me that that a young creature who has shown the greatest love and care for me has been most cruelly used by by you mother <\s>
<s> for god's sake stop cried out warrington <\s>
<s> she's ill don't you see she is ill <\s>
<s> let him go on said the widow faintly <\s>
<s> let him go on and kill her said laura rushing up to her mother's side <\s>
<s> speak on sir and see her die <\s>
<s> it is you who are cruel cried pen more exasperated and more savage because his own heart naturally soft and weak revolted indignantly at the injustice of the very suffering which was laid at his door <\s>
<s> it is you that are cruel who attribute all this pain to me it is you who are cruel with your wicked reproaches your wicked doubts of me your wicked persecutions of those who love me yes those who love me and who brave everything for me and whom you despise and trample upon because they are of lower degree than you <\s>
<s> shall i tell you what i will do what i am resolved to do now that i know what your conduct has been i will go back to this poor girl whom you turned out of my doors and ask her to come back and share my home with me <\s>
<s> i'll defy the pride which persecutes her and the pitiless suspicion which insults her and me <\s>
<s> do you mean pen that you here the widow with eager eyes and outstretched hands was breaking out but laura stopped her silence hush dear mother she cried and the widow hushed <\s>
<s> savagely as pen spoke she was only too eager to hear what more he had to say <\s>
<s> go on arthur go on arthur was all she said almost swooning away as she spoke <\s>
<s> by gad i say he shan't go on or i won't hear him by gad the major said trembling too in his wrath <\s>
<s> if you choose sir after all we've done for you after all i've done for you myself to insult your mother and disgrace your name by allying yourself with a low born kitchen girl go and do it by gad but let us ma'am have no more to do with him <\s>
<s> i wash my hands of you sir i wash my hands of you <\s>
<s> i'm an old fellow i ain't long for this world <\s>
<s> i come of as ancient and honourable a family as any in england by gad and i did hope before i went off the hooks by gad that the fellow that i'd liked and brought up and nursed through life by jove would do something to show me that our name yes the name of pendennis by gad was left undishonoured behind us but if he won't dammy i say amen <\s>
<s> by g both my father and my brother jack were the proudest men in england and i never would have thought that there would come this disgrace to my name never and and i'm ashamed that it's arthur pendennis <\s>
<s> the old fellow's voice here broke off into a sob it was the second time that arthur had brought tears from those wrinkled lids <\s>
<s> the sound of his breaking voice stayed pen's anger instantly and he stopped pacing the room as he had been doing until that moment <\s>
<s> laura was by helen's sofa and warrington had remained hitherto an almost silent but not uninterested spectator of the family storm <\s>
<s> as the parties were talking it had grown almost dark and after the lull which succeeded the passionate outbreak of the major george's deep voice as it here broke trembling into the twilight room was heard with no small emotion by all <\s>
<s> will you let me tell you something about myself my kind friends <\s>
<s> he said you have been so good to me ma'am you have been so kind to me laura i hope i may call you so sometimes my dear pen and i have been such friends that i have long wanted to tell you my story such as it is and would have told it to you earlier but that it is a sad one and contains another's secret <\s>
<s> however it may do good for arthur to know it it is that every one here should <\s>
<s> it will divert you from thinking about a subject which out of a fatal misconception has caused a great deal of pain to all of you <\s>
<s> may i please tell you mrs <\s>
<s> pray speak was all helen said and indeed she was not much heeding her mind was full of another idea with which pen's words had supplied her and she was in a terror of hope that what he had hinted might be as she wished <\s>
<s> george filled himself a bumper of wine and emptied it and began to speak <\s>
<s> you all of you know how you see me he said a man without a desire to make an advance in the world careless about reputation and living in a garret and from hand to mouth though i have friends and a name and i daresay capabilities of my own that would serve me if i had a mind <\s>
<s> but mind i have none <\s>
<s> i shall die in that garret most likely and alone <\s>
<s> i nailed myself to that doom in early life <\s>
<s> shall i tell you what it was that interested me about arthur years ago and made me inclined towards him when first i saw him <\s>
<s> the men from our college at oxbridge brought up accounts of that early affair with the chatteris actress about whom pen has talked to me since and who but for the major's generalship might have been your daughter in law ma'am <\s>
<s> i can't see pen in the dark but he blushes i'm sure and i dare say miss bell does and my friend major pendennis i dare say laughs as he ought to do for he won <\s>
<s> what would have been arthur's lot now had he been tied at nineteen to an illiterate woman older than himself with no qualities in common between them to make one a companion for the other no equality no confidence and no love speedily <\s>
<s> what could he have been but most miserable <\s>
<s> and when he spoke just now and threatened a similar union be sure it was but a threat occasioned by anger which you must give me leave to say ma'am was very natural on his part for after a generous and manly conduct let me say who know the circumstances well most generous and manly and self denying which is rare with him he has met from some friends of his with a most unkind suspicion and has had to complain of the unfair treatment of another innocent person towards whom he and you all are under much obligation <\s>
<s> the widow was going to get up here and warrington seeing her attempt to rise said do i tire you ma'am <\s>
<s> oh no go on go on said helen delighted and he continued <\s>
<s> i liked him you see because of that early history of his which had come to my ears in college gossip and because i like a man if you will pardon me for saying so miss laura who shows that he can have a great unreasonable attachment for a woman <\s>
<s> that was why we became friends and are all friends here for always aren't we <\s>
<s> he added in a lower voice leaning over to her and pen has been a great comfort and companion to a lonely and unfortunate man <\s>
<s> i am not complaining of my lot you see for no man's is what he would have it and up in my garret where you left the flowers and with my old books and my pipe for a wife i am pretty contented and only occasionally envy other men whose careers in life are more brilliant or who can solace their ill fortune by what fate and my own fault has deprived me of the affection of a woman or a child <\s>
<s> here there came a sigh from somewhere near warrington in the dark and a hand was held out in his direction which however was instantly withdrawn for the prudery of our females is such that before all expression of feeling or natural kindness and regard a woman is taught to think of herself and the proprieties and to be ready to blush at the very slightest notice and checking as of course it ought this spontaneous motion modesty drew up again kindly friendship shrank back ashamed of itself and warrington resumed his history <\s>
<s> my fate is such as i made it and not lucky for me or for others involved in it <\s>
<s> i too had an adventure before i went to college and there was no one to save me as major pendennis saved pen <\s>
<s> pardon me miss laura if i tell this story before you <\s>
<s> it is as well that you all of you should hear my confession <\s>
<s> before i went to college as a boy of eighteen i was at a private tutor's and there like arthur i became attached or fancied i was attached to a woman of a much lower degree and a greater age than my own <\s>
<s> you shrink from me no i don't laura said and here the hand went out resolutely and laid itself in warrington's <\s>
<s> she had divined his story from some previous hints let fall by him and his first words at its commencement <\s>
<s> she was a yeoman's daughter in the neighbourhood warrington said with rather a faltering voice and i fancied what all young men fancy <\s>
<s> her parents knew who my father was and encouraged me with all sorts of coarse artifices and scoundrel flatteries which i see now about their house <\s>
<s> to do her justice i own she never cared for me but was forced into what happened by the threats and compulsion of her family <\s>
<s> would to god that i had not been deceived but in these matters we are deceived because we wish to be so and i thought i loved that poor woman <\s>
<s> what could come of such a marriage <\s>
<s> i found before long that i was married to a boor <\s>
<s> she could not comprehend one subject that interested me <\s>
<s> her dulness palled upon me till i grew to loathe it <\s>
<s> and after some time of a wretched furtive union i must tell you all i found letters somewhere and such letters they were which showed me that her heart such as it was had never been mine but had always belonged to a person of her own degree <\s>
<s> at my father's death i paid what debts i had contracted at college and settled every shilling which remained to me in an annuity upon upon those who bore my name on condition that they should hide themselves away and not assume it <\s>
<s> they have kept that condition as they would break it for more money <\s>
<s> if i had earned fame or reputation that woman would have come to claim it if i had made a name for myself those who no right to it would have borne it and i entered life at twenty god help me hopeless and ruined beyond remission <\s>
<s> i was the boyish victim of vulgar cheats and perhaps it is only of late i have found out how hard ah how hard it is to forgive them <\s>
<s> i told you the moral before pen and now i have told you the fable <\s>
<s> beware how you marry out of your degree <\s>
<s> i was made for a better lot than this i think but god has awarded me this one and so you see it is for me to look on and see others successful and others happy with a heart that shall be as little bitter as possible <\s>
<s> by gad sir cried the major in high good humour i intended you to marry miss laura here <\s>
<s> and by gad master shallow i owe you a thousand pound warrington said <\s>
<s> how d'ye mean a thousand <\s>
<s> it was only a pony sir replied the major simply at which the other laughed <\s>
<s> as for helen she was so delighted that she started up and said god bless you god for ever bless you mr <\s>
<s> warrington and kissed both his hands and ran up to pen and fell into his arms <\s>
<s> yes dearest mother he said as he held her to him and with a noble tenderness and emotion embraced and forgave her <\s>
<s> i am innocent and my dear dear mother has done me a wrong <\s>
<s> oh yes my child i have wronged you thank god i have wronged you <\s>
<s> come away arthur not here i want to ask my child to forgive me and and my god to forgive me and to bless you and love you my son <\s>
<s> he led her tottering into her room and closed the door as the three touched spectators of the reconciliation looked on in pleased silence <\s>
<s> ever after ever after the tender accents of that voice faltering sweetly at his ear the look of the sacred eyes beaming with an affection unutterable the quiver of the fond lips smiling mournfully were remembered by the young man <\s>
<s> and at his best moments and at his hours of trial and grief and at his times of success or well doing the mother's face looked down upon him and blessed him with its gaze of pity and purity as he saw it in that night when she yet lingered with him and when she seemed ere she quite left him an angel transfigured and glorified with love for which love as for the greatest of the bounties and wonders of god's provision for us let us kneel and thank our father <\s>
<s> the moon had risen by this time arthur recollected well afterwards how it lighted up his mother's sweet pale face <\s>
<s> their talk or his rather for she scarcely could speak was more tender and confidential than it had been for years before <\s>
<s> he was the frank and generous boy of her early days and love <\s>
<s> he told her the story the mistake regarding which had caused her so much pain his struggles to fly from temptation and his thankfulness that he had been able to overcome it <\s>
<s> he never would do the girl wrong never or wound his own honour or his mother's pure heart <\s>
<s> the threat that he would return was uttered in a moment of exasperation of which he repented <\s>
<s> he never would see her again <\s>
<s> but his mother said yes he should and it was she who had been proud and culpable and she would like to give fanny bolton something and she begged her dear boy's pardon for opening the letter and she would write to the young girl if if she had time <\s>
<s> was it not natural that she should love her arthur <\s>
<s> and again she kissed him and she blessed him <\s>
<s> as they were talking the clock struck nine and helen reminded him how when he was a little boy she used to go up to his bedroom at that hour and hear him say our father <\s>
<s> and once more oh once more the young man fell down at his mother's sacred knees and sobbed out the prayer which the divine tenderness uttered for us and which has been echoed by twenty ages since by millions of sinful and humbled men <\s>
<s> and as he spoke the last words of the supplication the mother's head fell down on her boy's and her arms closed round him and together they repeated the words for ever and ever and amen <\s>
<s> a little time after it might have been a quarter of an hour laura heard arthur's voice call from within laura <\s>
<s> she rushed into the room instantly and found the young man still on his knees and holding his mother's hand <\s>
<s> helen's head had sunk back and was quite pale in the room <\s>
<s> pen looked round scared with a ghastly terror <\s>
<s> he said she's fainted she's laura screamed and fell by the side of helen <\s>
<s> the shriek brought warrington and major pendennis and the servants to the room <\s>

<s> i am glad that she gave me her blessing before she went away warrington said to pen and as for arthur with a humble acknowledgment and wonder at so much affection he hardly dared to ask of heaven to make him worthy of it though he felt that a saint there was interceding for him <\s>
<s> all the lady's affairs were found in perfect order and her little property ready for transmission to her son in trust for whom she held it <\s>
<s> papers in her desk showed that she had long been aware of the complaint one of the heart under which she laboured and knew that it would suddenly remove her and a prayer was found in her handwriting asking that her end might be as it was in the arms of her son <\s>
<s> laura and arthur talked over her sayings all of which the former most fondly remembered to the young man's shame somewhat who thought how much greater her love had been for helen than his own <\s>

<s> dear fanny pen said i have to acknowledge two letters from you one of which was delayed in my illness pen found the first letter in his mother's desk after her decease and the reading it gave him a strange pang and to thank you my kind nurse and friend who watched me so tenderly during my fever <\s>
<s> and i have to tell you that the last words of my dear mother who is no more were words of goodwill and gratitude to you for nursing me and she said she would have written to you had she had time that she would like to ask your pardon if she had harshly treated you and that she would beg you to show your forgiveness by accepting some token of friendship and regard from her <\s>

<s> an hour previous to this time and at a different part of the course there might have been seen an old stage coach on the battered roof of which a crowd of shabby raffs were stamping and hallooing as the great event of the day the derby race rushed over the greensward and by the shouting millions of people assembled to view that magnificent scene <\s>
<s> this was wheeler's the harlequin's head drag which had brought down a company of choice spirits from bow street with a slap up luncheon in the boot <\s>
<s> as the whirling race flashed by each of the choice spirits bellowed out the name of the horse or the colours which he thought or he hoped might be foremost <\s>
<s> and so forth yelled the gentlemen sportsmen during that delicious and thrilling minute before the contest was decided and as the fluttering signal blew out showing the number of the famous horse podasokus as winner of the race one of the gentlemen on the harlequin's head drag sprang up off the roof as if he was a pigeon and about to fly away to london or york with the news <\s>
<s> but his elation did not lift him many inches from his standing place to which he came down again on the instant causing the boards of the crazy old coach roof to crack with the weight of his joy <\s>
<s> he bawled out podasokus is the horse <\s>
<s> supper for ten wheeler my boy <\s>
<s> ask you all round of course and damn the expense <\s>
<s> and the gentlemen on the carriage the shabby swaggerers the dubious bucks said thank you congratulate you colonel sup with you with pleasure and whispered to one another the colonel stands to win fifteen hundred and he got the odds from a good man too <\s>
<s> and each of the shabby bucks and dusky dandies began to eye his neighbour with suspicion lest that neighbour taking his advantage should get the colonel into a lonely place and borrow money of him <\s>
<s> and the winner on podasokus could not be alone during the whole of that afternoon so closely did his friends watch him and each other <\s>
<s> at another part of the course you might have seen a vehicle certainly more modest if not more shabby than that battered coach which had brought down the choice spirits from the harlequin's head this was cab no <\s>
<s> 2002 which had conveyed a gentleman and two ladies from the cabstand in the strand whereof one of the ladies as she sate on the box of the cab enjoying with her mamma and their companion a repast of lobster salad and bitter ale looked so fresh and pretty that many of the splendid young dandies who were strolling about the course and enjoying themselves at the noble diversion of sticks and talking to the beautifully dressed ladies in the beautiful carriages on the hill forsook these fascinations to have a glance at the smiling and rosy cheeked lass on the cab <\s>
<s> the blushes of youth and good humour mantled on the girl's cheeks and played over that fair countenance like the pretty shining cloudlets on the serene sky overhead the elder lady's cheek was red too but that was a permanent mottled rose deepening only as it received free draughts of pale ale and brandy and water until her face emulated the rich shell of the lobster which she devoured <\s>
<s> the gentleman who escorted these two ladies was most active in attendance upon them here on the course as he had been during the previous journey <\s>
<s> during the whole of that animated and delightful drive from london his jokes had never ceased <\s>
<s> he spoke up undauntedly to the most awful drags full of the biggest and most solemn guardsmen as to the humblest donkey chaise in which bob the dustman was driving molly to the race <\s>
<s> he had fired astonishing volleys of what is called chaff into endless windows as he passed into lines of grinning girls schools into little regiments of shouting urchins hurraying behind the railings of their classical and commercial academies into casements whence smiling maid servants and nurses tossing babies or demure old maiden ladies with dissenting countenances were looking <\s>
<s> and the pretty girl in the straw bonnet with pink ribbon and her mamma the devourer of lobsters had both agreed that when he was in spirits there was nothing like that mr <\s>
<s> he had crammed the cab with trophies won from the bankrupt proprietors of the sticks hard by and with countless pincushions wooden apples backy boxes jack in the boxes and little soldiers <\s>
<s> he had brought up a gipsy with a tawny child in her arms to tell the fortunes of the ladies and the only cloud which momentarily obscured the sunshine of that happy party was when the teller of fate informed the young lady that had had reason to beware of a fair man who was false to her that she had had a bad illness and that she would find that a man would prove true <\s>
<s> the girl looked very much abashed at this news her mother and the young man interchanged signs of wonder and intelligence <\s>
<s> perhaps the conjurer had used the same words to a hundred different carriages on that day <\s>

<s> as he caught sight of the young lady on the box she started and turned pale her mother became redder than ever the heretofore gay and triumphant mr <\s>
<s> sam immediately assumed a fierce and suspicious look and his eyes turned savagely from fanny bolton whom the reader no doubt has recognised in the young lady of the cab to arthur pendennis advancing to meet her <\s>

<s> there he stood about whom she was going to die ten months since dandified supercilious with a black crape to his white hat and jet buttons in his shirt front and a pink in his coat that some one else had probably given him with the tightest lavender coloured gloves sewn with black and the smallest of canes <\s>
<s> huxter wore no gloves and great blucher boots and smelt very much of tobacco certainly and looked oh it must be owned he looked as if a bucket of water would do him a great deal of good <\s>

<s> i am very thirsty he said and i will be glad to drink your health fanny and i hope mr <\s>
<s> huxter will pardon me for having been very rude to him the last time we met and when i was so ill and out of spirits that indeed i scarcely knew what i said <\s>

<s> master frank had been put inside of the carriage and was asleep there by the side of the major dozing away the effects of the constant luncheon and champagne of which he had freely partaken <\s>
<s> the major was revolving in his mind meanwhile the news the receipt of which had made him so grave <\s>
<s> if sir francis clavering goes on in this way pendennis the elder thought this little tipsy rascal will be as bankrupt as his father and grandfather before him <\s>

<s> i say ma shall i tell you something <\s>
<s> the begum expressed her desire to hear this something and her son and heir continued when me and strong was down at the grand stand after the race and i was talking to leggat minor who was there with his governor i saw pa look as savage as a bear <\s>

<s> i'm afraid it's true ma'am he said turning round i deplore the loss as much as you can <\s>
<s> he promised me as he promised you but the play is too strong for him <\s>
<s> he can't refrain from it <\s>
<s> lady clavering at this sad news burst into a fit of tears <\s>
<s> she deplored her wretched fate as the most miserable of women she declared she would separate and pay no more debts for the ungrateful man <\s>
<s> she narrated with tearful volubility a score of stories only too authentic which showed how her husband had deceived and how constantly she had befriended him and in this melancholy condition whilst young hopeful was thinking about the two guineas which he himself had won and the major revolving in his darkened mind whether certain plans which he had been forming had better not be abandoned the splendid carriage drove up at length to the begum's house in grosvenor place the idlers and boys lingering about the place to witness according to public wont the close of the derby day cheering the carriage as it drew up and envying the happy folks who descended from it <\s>
<s> and it's for the son of this man that i am made a beggar <\s>
<s> blanche said quivering with anger as she walked upstairs leaning on the major's arm for this cheat for this blackleg for this liar for this robber of women <\s>
<s> calm yourself my dear miss blanche the old gentleman said i pray calm yourself <\s>
<s> you have been hardly treated most unjustly <\s>
<s> but remember that you have always a friend in me and trust to an old fellow who will try and serve you <\s>
<s> and the young lady and the heir of the hopeful house of clavering having retired to their beds the remaining three of the epsom party remained for some time in deep consultation <\s>
<s> explanations almost a year as the reader will perceive has passed since an event described a few pages back <\s>
<s> arthur's black coat is about to be exchanged for a blue one <\s>
<s> his person has undergone other more pleasing and remarkable changes <\s>
<s> his wig has been laid aside and his hair though somewhat thinner has returned to public view <\s>
<s> and he has had the honour of appearing at court in the uniform of a cornet of the clavering troop of the shire yeomanry cavalry being presented to the sovereign by the marquis of steyne <\s>
<s> this was a measure strongly and pathetically urged by arthur's uncle <\s>
<s> the major would not hear of a year passing before this ceremony of gentlemanhood was gone through <\s>
<s> the old gentleman thought that his nephew should belong to some rather more select club than the megatherium and has announced everywhere in the world his disappointment that the young man's property has turned out not by any means as well as he could have hoped and is under fifteen hundred a year <\s>
<s> that is the amount at which pendennis's property is set down in the world where his publishers begin to respect him much more than formerly and where even mammas are by no means uncivil to him <\s>
<s> for if the pretty daughters are naturally to marry people of very different expectations at any rate he will be eligible for the plain ones and if the brilliant and fascinating myra is to hook an earl poor little beatrice who has one shoulder higher than the other must hang on to some boor through life and why should not mr <\s>
<s> pendennis be her support <\s>
<s> in the very first winter after the accession to his mother's fortune mrs <\s>
<s> hawxby in a country house caused her beatrice to learn billiards from mr <\s>
<s> pendennis and would be driven by nobody but him in the pony carriage because he was literary and her beatrice was literary too and declared that the young man under the instigation of his horrid old uncle had behaved most infamously in trifling with beatrice's feelings <\s>
<s> the truth is the old gentleman who knew mrs <\s>
<s> hawxby's character and how desperately that lady would practise upon unwary young men had come to the country house in question and carried arthur out of the danger of her immediate claws though not out of the reach of her tongue <\s>
<s> the elder pendennis would have had his nephew pass a part of the christmas at clavering whither the family had returned but arthur had not the heart for that <\s>
<s> clavering was too near poor old fairoaks and that was too full of sad recollections for the young man <\s>
<s> we have lost sight of the claverings too until their reappearance upon the epsom race ground and must give a brief account of them in the interval <\s>
<s> during the past year the world has not treated any member of the clavering family very kindly lady clavering one of the best natured women that ever enjoyed a good dinner or made a slip in grammar has had her appetite and good nature sadly tried by constant family grievances and disputes such as make the efforts of the best french cook unpalatable and the most delicately stuffed sofa cushion hard to lie on <\s>
<s> i'd rather have a turnip strong for dessert than that pineapple and all them muscatel grapes from clavering says poor lady clavering looking at her dinner table and confiding her grief to her faithful friend if i could but have a little quiet to eat it with <\s>
<s> oh how much happier i was when i was a widow and before all this money fell in to me <\s>
<s> the clavering family had indeed made a false start in life and had got neither conduct nor position nor thanks for the hospitalities which they administered nor a return of kindness from the people whom they entertained <\s>
<s> the success of their first london season was doubtful and their failure afterwards notorious <\s>
<s> human patience was not great enough to put up with sir francis clavering people said <\s>
<s> he was too hopelessly low dull and disreputable <\s>
<s> you could not say what but there was a taint about the house and its entourages <\s>
<s> who was the begum with her money and without her h's and where did she come from <\s>
<s> what an extraordinary little piece of conceit the daughter was with her gallicised graces and daring affectations not fit for well bred english girls to associate with <\s>
<s> what strange people were those they assembled round about them <\s>
<s> sir francis clavering was a gambler living notoriously in the society of blacklegs and profligates <\s>
<s> hely clinker who was in his regiment said that he not only cheated at cards but showed the white feather <\s>
<s> what could lady rockminster have meant by taking her up <\s>
<s> after the first season indeed lady rockminster who had taken up lady clavering put her down the great ladies would not take their daughters to her parties the young men who attended them behaved with the most odious freedom and scornful familiarity and poor lady clavering herself avowed that she was obliged to take what she called the canal into her parlour because the tip tops wouldn't come <\s>
<s> she had not the slightest ill will towards the canal the poor dear lady or any pride about herself or idea that she was better than her neighbour but she had taken implicitly the orders which on her entry into the world her social godmother had given her she had been willing to know whom they knew and ask whom they asked <\s>
<s> the canal in fact was much pleasanter than what is called society but as we said before that to leave a mistress is easy while on the contrary to be left by her is cruel so you may give up society without any great pang or anything but a sensation of relief at the parting but severe are the mortifications and pains you have if society gives up you <\s>
<s> one young man of fashion we have mentioned who at least it might have been expected would have been found faithful amongst the faithless and harry foker esq was indeed that young man <\s>
<s> but he had not managed matters with prudence and the unhappy passion at first confided to pen became notorious and ridiculous to the town was carried to the ears of his weak and fond mother and finally brought under the cognisance of the bald headed and inflexible foker senior <\s>
<s> foker learned this disagreeable news there took place between him and his son a violent and painful scene which ended in the poor little gentleman's banishment from england for a year with a positive order to return at the expiration of that time and complete his marriage with his cousin or to retire into private life and three hundred a year altogether and never see parent or brewery more <\s>
<s> henry foker went away then carrying with him that grief and care which passes free at the strictest custom houses and which proverbially accompanies the exile and with this crape over his eyes even the parisian boulevard looked melancholy to him and the sky of italy black <\s>
<s> to sir francis clavering that year was a most unfortunate one <\s>
<s> the events described in the last chapter came to complete the ruin of the year <\s>
<s> it was that year of grace in which as our sporting readers may remember lord harrowhill's horse he was a classical young nobleman and named his stud out of the iliad when podasokus won the derby to the dismay of the knowing ones who pronounced the winning horse's name in various extraordinary ways and who backed borax who was nowhere in the race <\s>
<s> sir francis clavering who was intimate with some of the most rascally characters of the turf and of course had valuable information had laid heavy odds against the winning horse and backed the favourite freely and the result of his dealings was as his son correctly stated to poor lady clavering a loss of seven thousand pounds <\s>
<s> indeed it was a cruel blow upon the lady who had discharged her husband's debts many times over who had received as many times his oaths and promises of amendment who had paid his money lenders and horse dealers who had furnished his town and country houses and who was called upon now instantly to meet this enormous sum the penalty of her cowardly husband's extravagance <\s>
<s> it has been described in former pages how the elder pendennis had become the adviser of the clavering family and in his quality of intimate friend of the house had gone over every room of ii and even seen that ugly closet which we all of us have and in which according to the proverb the family skeleton is locked up <\s>
<s> about the baronet's pecuniary matters if the major did not know it was because clavering himself did not know them and hid them from himself and others in such a hopeless entanglement of lies that it was impossible for adviser or attorney or principal to get an accurate knowledge of his affairs <\s>
<s> but concerning lady clavering the major was much better informed and when the unlucky mishap of the derby arose he took upon himself to become completely and thoroughly acquainted with all her means whatsoever they were and was now accurately informed of the vast and repeated sacrifices which the widow amory had made in behalf of her present husband <\s>
<s> he did not conceal and he had won no small favour from miss blanche by avowing it his opinion that lady clavering's daughter had been hardly treated at the expense of her son by her second marriage and in his conversations with lady clavering had fairly hinted that he thought miss blanche ought to have a better provision <\s>
<s> we have said that he had already given the widow to understand that he knew all the particulars of her early and unfortunate history having been in india at the time when when the painful circumstances occurred which had ended in her parting from her first husband <\s>
<s> he could tell her where to find the calcutta newspaper which contained the account of amory's trial and he showed and the begum was not a little grateful to him for his forbearance how being aware all along of this mishap which had befallen her he had kept all knowledge of it to himself and been constantly the friend of her family <\s>
<s> interested motives my dear lady clavering he said of course i may have had <\s>
<s> we all have interested motives and mine i don't conceal from you was to make a marriage between my nephew and your daughter <\s>
<s> to which lady clavering perhaps with some surprise that the major should choose her family for a union with his own said she was quite willing to consent <\s>
<s> but frankly he said my dear lady my boy has but five hundred a year and a wife with ten thousand pounds to her fortune would scarcely better him <\s>
<s> we could do better for him than that permit me to say and he is a shrewd cautious young fellow who has sown his wild oats now who has very good parts and plenty of ambition and whose object in marrying is to better himself <\s>
<s> if you and sir francis chose and sir francis take my word for it will refuse you nothing you could put arthur in a way to advance very considerably in the world and show the stuff which he has in him <\s>
<s> of what use is that seat in parliament to clavering who scarcely ever shows his face in the house or speaks a word there <\s>
<s> i'm told by gentlemen who heard my boy at oxbridge that he was famous as an orator begad and once put his foot into the stirrup and mount him i've no doubt he won't be the last of the field ma'am <\s>
<s> i've tested the chap and know him pretty well i think <\s>
<s> he is much too lazy and careless and flighty a fellow to make a jog trot journey and arrive as your lawyers do at the end of their lives <\s>
<s> but give him a start and good friends and an opportunity and take my word for it he'll make himself a name that his sons shall be proud of <\s>
<s> i don't see any way for a fellow like him to parvenir but by making a prudent marriage not with a beggarly heiress to sit down for life upon a miserable fifteen hundred a year but with somebody whom he can help and who can help him forward in the world and whom he can give a good name and a station in the country begad in return for the advantages which she brings him <\s>
<s> it would be better for you to have a distinguished son in law than to keep your husband on in parliament who's of no good to himself or to anybody else there and that's i say why i've been interested about you and offer you what i think a good bargain for both <\s>
<s> you know i look upon arthur as one of the family almost now said the good natured begum he comes and goes when he likes and the more i think of his dear mother the more i see there's few people so good none so good to me <\s>
<s> and i'm sure i cried when i heard of her death and would have gone into mourning for her myself only black don't become me <\s>
<s> and i know who his mother wanted him to marry laura i mean whom old lady rockminster has taken such a fancy to and no wonder <\s>
<s> she's a better girl than my girl <\s>
<s> and my betsy blanche i mean ain't been a comfort to me major <\s>
<s> it's laura pen ought to marry <\s>
<s> marry on five hundred a year <\s>
<s> my dear good soul you are mad <\s>
<s> think over what i have said to you <\s>
<s> do nothing in your affairs with that unhappy husband of yours without consulting me and remember that old pendennis is always your friend <\s>
<s> for some time previous pen's uncle had held similar language to miss amory <\s>
<s> he had pointed out to her the convenience of the match which he had at heart and was bound to say that mutual convenience was of all things the very best in the world to marry upon the only thing <\s>
<s> look at your love marriages my dear young creature <\s>
<s> the love match people are the most notorious of all for quarrelling afterwards and a girl who runs away with jack to gretna green constantly runs away with tom to switzerland afterwards <\s>
<s> the great point in marriage is for people to agree to be useful to one another <\s>
<s> the lady brings the means and the gentleman avails himself of them <\s>
<s> my boy's wife brings the horse and begad pen goes in and wins the plate <\s>
<s> that's what i call a sensible union <\s>
<s> a couple like that have something to talk to each other about when they come together <\s>
<s> if you had cupid himself to talk to if blanche and pen were cupid and psyche begad they'd begin to yawn after a few evenings if they had nothing but sentiment to speak on <\s>
<s> as for miss amory she was contented enough with pen as long as there was nobody better <\s>
<s> and how many other young ladies are like her and how many love marriages carry on well to the last and how sentimental firms do not finish in bankruptcy and how many heroic passions don't dwindle down into despicable indifference or end in shameful defeat <\s>
<s> these views of life and philosophy the major was constantly according to his custom inculcating to pen whose mind was such that he could see the right on both sides of many questions and comprehending the sentimental life which was quite out of the reach of the honest major's intelligence could understand the practical life too and accommodate himself or think he could accommodate himself to it <\s>
<s> so it came to pass that during the spring succeeding his mother's death he became a good deal under the influence of his uncle's advice and domesticated in lady clavering's house and in a measure was accepted by miss amory without being a suitor and was received without being engaged <\s>
<s> the young people were extremely familiar without being particularly sentimental and met and parted with each other in perfect good humour <\s>
<s> and i thought pendennis am the fellow who eight years ago had a grand passion and last year was raging in a fever about briseis <\s>
<s> yes it was the same pendennis and time had brought to him as to the rest of us its ordinary consequences consolations developments <\s>
<s> we alter very little <\s>
<s> when we talk of this man or that woman being no longer the same person whom we remember in youth and remark of course to deplore changes in our friends we don't perhaps calculate that circumstance only brings out the latent defect or quality and does not create it <\s>
<s> the selfish languor and indifference of to day's possession is the consequence of the selfish ardour of yesterday's pursuit the scorn and weariness which cries vanitas vanitatum is but the lassitude of the sick appetite palled with pleasure the insolence of the successful parvenu is only the necessary continuance of the career of the needy struggler our mental changes are like our grey hairs or our wrinkles but the fulfilment of the plan of mortal growth and decay that which is snow white now was glossy black once that which is sluggish obesity to day was boisterous rosy health a few years back that calm weariness benevolent resigned and disappointed was ambition fierce and violent but a few years since and has only settled into submissive repose after many a battle and defeat <\s>

<s> are you not awestricken you friendly reader who taking the page up for a moment's light reading lay it down perchance for a graver reflection to think how you who have consummated your success or your disaster may be holding marked station or a hopeless and nameless place in the crowd who have passed through how many struggles of defeat success crime remorse to yourself only known who may have loved and grown cold wept and laughed again how often to think how you are the same you whom in childhood you remember before the voyage of life began <\s>

<s> conversations our good natured begum was at first so much enraged at this last instance of her husband's duplicity and folly that she refused to give sir francis clavering any aid in order to meet his debts of honour and declared that she would separate from him and leave him to the consequences of his incorrigible weakness and waste <\s>
<s> after that fatal day's transactions at the derby the unlucky gambler was in such a condition of mind that he was disposed to avoid everybody alike his turf associates with whom he had made the debts which he trembled lest he should not have the means of paying and his wife his long suffering banker on whom he reasonably doubted whether he should be allowed any longer to draw <\s>
<s> when lady clavering asked the next morning whether sir francis was in the house she received answer that he had not returned that night but had sent a messenger to his valet ordering him to forward clothes and letters by the bearer <\s>
<s> strong knew that he should have a visit or a message from him in the course of that or the subsequent day and accordingly got a note beseeching him to call upon his distracted friend f <\s>

<s> bonner my lady's housekeeper and confidential maid who carried it to my lady <\s>
<s> and thus every single person in the grosvenor place establishment knew that sir francis was in hiding under the name of francis at an inn in the blackfriars road <\s>
<s> and sir francis's coachman told the news to other gentlemen's coachmen who carried it to their masters and to the neighbouring tattersall's where very gloomy anticipations were formed that sir francis clavering was about to make a tour in the levant <\s>
<s> in the course of that day the number of letters addressed to sir francis clavering bart which found their way to his hall table was quite remarkable <\s>

<s> numbers of the colonel's friends were present on the occasion to congratulate him on his luck all altamont's own set and the gents who met in the private parlour of the convivial wheeler my host of the harlequin's head came to witness their comrade's good fortune and would have liked with a generous sympathy for success to share in it <\s>

<s> don't say er but her borrer but borrow actially but actually fanny mr <\s>

<s> well then her and borrow and hactually there then you stoopid said the other and the scholar made such a pretty face that the grammar master was quickly appeased and would have willingly given her a hundred more lessons on the spot at the price which he took for that one <\s>

<s> sam were on exceedingly familiar and confidential terms by this time and that time had brought to the former certain consolations and soothed certain regrets which are deucedly bitter when they occur but which are no more than tooth pulling or any other pang eternal <\s>

<s> is this mere dreaming or on the part of an idle story teller useless moralising <\s>
<s> may not the man of the world take his moment too to be grave and thoughtful <\s>
<s> ask of your own hearts and memories brother and sister if we do not live in the dead and to speak reverently prove god by love <\s>
<s> of these matters pen and warrington often spoke in many a solemn and friendly converse in after days and pendennis's mother was worshipped in his memory and canonised there as such a saint ought to be <\s>
<s> lucky he in life who knows a few such women <\s>
<s> a kind provision of heaven it was that sent us such and gave us to admire that touching and wonderful spectacle of innocence and love and beauty <\s>
<s> but as it is certain that if in the course of these sentimental conversations any outer stranger major pendennis for instance had walked into pen's chambers arthur and warrington would have stopped their talk and chosen another subject and discoursed about the opera or the last debate in parliament or miss jones's marriage with captain smith or what not so let us imagine that the public steps in at this juncture and stops the confidential talk between author and reader and begs us to resume our remarks about this world with which both are certainly better acquainted than with that other one into which we have just been peeping <\s>
<s> on coming into his property arthur pendennis at first comported himself with a modesty and equanimity which obtained his friend warrington's praises though arthur's uncle was a little inclined to quarrel with his nephew's meanness of spirit for not assuming greater state and pretensions now that he had entered on the enjoyment of his kingdom <\s>
<s> he would have had arthur installed in handsome quarters and riding on showy park hacks or in well built cabriolets every day <\s>
<s> i am too absent arthur said with a laugh to drive a cab in london the omnibus would cut me in two or i should send my horse's head into the ladies carriage windows and you wouldn't have me driven about by my servant like an apothecary uncle <\s>
<s> no major pendennis would on no account have his nephew appear like an apothecary the august representative of the house of pendennis must not so demean himself <\s>
<s> and when arthur pursuing his banter said and yet i dare say sir my father was proud enough when he first set up his gig the old major hemmed and ha'd and his wrinkled face reddened with a blush as he answered you know what buonaparte said sir il faut laver son linge sale en famille <\s>
<s> there is no need sir for you to brag that your father was a a medical man <\s>
<s> he came of a most ancient but fallen house and was obliged to reconstruct the family fortunes as many a man of good family has done before him <\s>
<s> you are like the fellow in sterne sir the marquis who came to demand his sword again <\s>
<s> your father got back yours for you <\s>
<s> you are a man of landed estate by gad sir and a gentleman never forget you are a gentleman <\s>
<s> then arthur slily turned on his uncle the argument which he had heard the old gentleman often use regarding himself <\s>
<s> in the society which i have the honour of frequenting through your introduction who cares to ask about my paltry means or my humble gentility uncle <\s>
<s> it would be absurd of me to attempt to compete with the great folks and all that they can ask from us is that we should have a decent address and good manners <\s>
<s> but for all that sir i should belong to a better club or two the uncle answered i should give an occasional dinner and select my society well and i should come out of that horrible garret in the temple sir <\s>
<s> and so arthur compromised by descending to the second floor in lamb court warrington still occupying his old quarters and the two friends being determined not to part one from the other <\s>
<s> cultivate kindly reader those friendships of your youth it is only in that generous time that they are formed <\s>
<s> how different the intimacies of after days are and how much weaker the grasp of your own hand after it has been shaken about in twenty years commerce with the world and has squeezed and dropped a thousand equally careless palms <\s>
<s> as you can seldom fashion your tongue to speak a new language after twenty the heart refuses to receive friendship pretty soon it gets too hard to yield to the impression <\s>
<s> so pen had many acquaintances and being of a jovial and easy turn got more daily but no friend like warrington and the two men continued to live almost as much in common as the knights of the temple riding upon one horse for pen's was at warrington's service and having their chambers and their servitor in common <\s>
<s> warrington had made the acquaintance of pen's friends of grosvenor place during their last unlucky season in london and had expressed himself no better satisfied with sir francis and lady clavering and her ladyship's daughter than was the public in general <\s>
<s> the world is right george said about those people <\s>
<s> the young men laugh and talk freely before those ladies and about them <\s>
<s> the girl sees people whom she has no right to know and talks to men with whom no girl should have an intimacy <\s>
<s> did you see those two reprobates leaning over lady clavering's carriage in the park the other day and leering under miss blanche's bonnet <\s>

<s> you call me a cynic why what a monstrous cynicism it is which you and the rest of you men of the world admit <\s>
<s> i'd rather live upon raw turnips and sleep in a hollow tree or turn backwoodsman or savage than degrade myself to this civilisation and own that a french cook was the thing in life best worth living for <\s>

<s> asked pendennis why not acknowledge the world i stand upon and submit to the conditions of the society which we live in and live by <\s>
<s> i am older than you george in spite of your grizzled whiskers and have seen much more of the world than you have in your garret here shut up with your books and your reveries and your ideas of one and twenty <\s>

<s> if the time is out of joint have i any calling or strength to set it right <\s>
<s> indeed i don't think you have much of either growled pen's interlocutor <\s>
<s> if i doubt whether i am better than my neighbour arthur continued if i concede that i am no better i also doubt whether he is better than i <\s>
<s> i see men who begin with ideas of universal reform and who before their beards are grown propound their loud plans for the regeneration of mankind give up their schemes after a few years of bootless talking and vainglorious attempts to lead their fellows and after they have found that men will no longer bear them as indeed they never were in the least worthy to be heard sink quietly into the ranks and file acknowledging their aims impracticable or thankful that they were never put into practice <\s>
<s> the fiercest reformers grow calm and are faire to put up with things as they are the loudest radical orators become dumb quiescent placemen the most fervent liberals when out of power become humdrum conservatives or downright tyrants or despots in office <\s>

<s> would you say that the conduct of these men is an act of treason as the radicals bawl who would give way in their turn were their turn ever to come <\s>
<s> no only that they submit to circumstances which are stronger than they march as the world marches towards reform but at the world's pace and the movements of the vast body of mankind must needs be slow forgo this scheme as impracticable on account of opposition that as immature because against the sense of the majority are forced to calculate drawbacks and difficulties as well as to think of reforms and advances and compelled finally to submit and to wait and to compromise <\s>
<s> the right honourable arthur pendennis could not speak better or be more satisfied with himself if he was first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer warrington said <\s>
<s> it seems to me that my scepticism is more respectful and more modest than the revolutionary ardour of other folks <\s>
<s> many a patriot of eighteen many a spouting club orator would turn the bishops out of the house of lords to morrow and throw the lords out after the bishops and throw the throne into the thames after the peers and the bench <\s>
<s> is that man more modest than i who takes these institutions as i find them and waits for time and truth to develop or fortify or if you like destroy them <\s>
<s> a college tutor or a nobleman's toady who appears one fine day as my right reverend lord in a silk apron and a shovel hat and assumes benedictory airs over me is still the same man we remember at oxbridge when he was truckling to the tufts and bullying the poor undergraduates in the lecture room <\s>
<s> an hereditary legislator who passes his time with jockeys and black legs and ballet girls and who is called to rule over me and his other betters because his grandfather made a lucky speculation in the funds or found a coal or tin mine on his property or because his stupid ancestor happened to be in command of ten thousand men as brave as himself who overcame twelve thousand frenchmen or fifty thousand indians such a man i say inspires me with no more respect than the bitterest democrat can feel towards him <\s>
<s> but such as he is he is a part of the old society to which we belong and i submit to his lordship with acquiescence and he takes his place above the best of us at all dinner parties and there bides his time <\s>
<s> i don't want to chop his head off with a guillotine or to fling mud at him in the streets <\s>
<s> when they call such a man a disgrace to his order and such another who is good and gentle refined and generous who employs his great means in promoting every kindness and charity and art and grace of life in the kindest and most gracious manner an ornament to his rank the question as to the use and propriety of the order is not in the least affected one way or other <\s>
<s> there it is extant among us a part of our habits the creed of many of us the growth of centuries the symbol of a most complicated tradition there stand my lord the bishop and my lord the hereditary legislator what the french call transactions both of them representing in their present shape mail clad barons and double sworded chiefs from whom their lordships the hereditaries for the most part don't descend and priests professing to hold an absolute truth and a divinely inherited power the which truth absolute our ancestors burned at the stake and denied there the which divine transmissible power still exists in print to be believed or not pretty much at choice and of these i say i acquiesce that they exist and no more <\s>
<s> if you say that these schemes devised before printing was known or steam was born when thought was an infant scared and whipped and truth under its guardians was gagged and swathed and blindfolded and not allowed to lift its voice or to look out or to walk under the sun before men were permitted to meet or to trade or to speak with each other if any one says as some faithful souls do that these schemes are for ever and having been changed and modified constantly are to be subject to no further development or decay i laugh and let the man speak <\s>
<s> but i would have toleration for these as i would ask it for my own opinions and if they are to die i would rather they had a decent and natural than an abrupt and violent death <\s>
<s> you would have sacrificed to jove warrington said had you lived in the time of the christian persecutions <\s>
<s> perhaps i would said pen with some sadness <\s>
<s> perhaps i am a coward perhaps my faith is unsteady but this is my own reserve <\s>
<s> what i argue here is that i will not persecute <\s>
<s> make a faith or a dogma absolute and persecution becomes a logical consequence and dominic burns a jew or calvin an arian or nero a christian or elizabeth or mary a papist or protestant or their father both or either according to his humour and acting without any pangs of remorse but on the contrary notions of duty fulfilled <\s>
<s> make dogma absolute and to inflict or to suffer death becomes easy and necessary and mahomet's soldiers shouting paradise <\s>
<s> and dying on the christian spears are not more or less praiseworthy than the same men slaughtering a townful of jews or cutting off the heads of all prisoners who would not acknowledge that there was but one prophet of god <\s>
<s> a little while since young one warrington said who had been listening to his friend's confessions neither without sympathy nor scorn for his mood led him to indulge in both you asked me why i remained out of the strife of the world and looked on at the great labour of my neighbour without taking any part in the struggle <\s>
<s> why what a mere dilettante you own yourself to be in this confession of general scepticism and what a listless spectator yourself <\s>
<s> you are six and twenty years old and as blase as a rake of sixty <\s>
<s> you neither hope much nor care much nor believe much <\s>
<s> you doubt about other men as much as about yourself <\s>
<s> were it made of such pococuranti as you the world would be intolerable and i had rather live in a wilderness of monkeys and listen to their chatter than in a company of men who denied everything <\s>
<s> were the world composed of saint bernards or saint dominies it would be equally odious said pen and at the end of a few scores of years would cease to exist altogether <\s>
<s> would you have every man with his head shaved and every woman in a cloister carrying out to the full the ascetic principle <\s>
<s> would you have conventicle hymns twanging from every lane in every city in the world <\s>
<s> would you have all the birds of the forest sing one note and fly with one feather <\s>
<s> you call me a sceptic because i acknowledge what is and in acknowledging that be it linnet or lark or priest or parson be it i mean any single one of the infinite varieties of the creatures of god whose very name i would be understood to pronounce with reverence and never to approach but with distant awe i say that the study and acknowledgment of that variety amongst men especially increases our respect and wonder for the creator commander and ordainer of all these minds so different and yet so united meeting in a common adoration and offering up each according to his degree and means of approaching the divine centre his acknowledgment of praise and worship each singing to recur to the bird simile his natural song <\s>
<s> and so arthur the hymn of a saint or the ode of a poet or the chant of a newgate thief are all pretty much the same in your philosophy said george <\s>
<s> even that sneer could be answered were it to the point pendennis replied but it is not and it could be replied to you that even to the wretched outcry of the thief on the tree the wisest and the best of all teachers we know of the untiring comforter and consoler promised a pitiful hearing and a certain hope <\s>
<s> who are we to measure the chances and opportunities the means of doing or even judging right and wrong awarded to men and to establish the rule for meting out their punishments and rewards <\s>
<s> we are as insolent and unthinking in judging of men's morals as of their intellects <\s>
<s> we admire this man as being a great philosopher and set down the other as a dullard not knowing either or the amount of truth in either or being certain of the truth anywhere <\s>
<s> we sing te deum for this hero who has won a battle and de profundis for that other one who has broken out of prison and has been caught afterwards by the policeman <\s>
<s> our measure of rewards and punishments is most partial and incomplete absurdly inadequate utterly worldly and we wish to continue it into the next world <\s>
<s> into that next and awful world we strive to pursue men and send after them our impotent party verdicts of condemnation or acquittal <\s>
<s> we set up our paltry little rods to measure heaven immeasurable as if in comparison to that newton's mind or pascal's or shakspeare's was any loftier than mine as if the ray which travels from the sun would reach me sooner than the man who blacks my boots <\s>
<s> measured by that altitude the tallest and the smallest among us are so alike diminutive and pitifully base that i say we should take no count of the calculation and it is a meanness to reckon the difference <\s>
<s> your figure fails there arthur said the other better pleased if even by common arithmetic we can multiply as we can reduce almost infinitely the great reckoner must take count of all and the small is not small or the great great to his infinity <\s>
<s> i don't call those calculations in question arthur said i only say that yours are incomplete and premature false in consequence and by every operation multiplying into wider error <\s>
<s> i do not condemn the men who murdered socrates and damned galileo <\s>
<s> i say that they damned galileo and murdered socrates <\s>
<s> and yet but a moment since you admitted the propriety of acquiescence in the present and i suppose all other tyrannies <\s>
<s> no but that if an opponent menaces me of whom and without cost of blood and violence i can get rid i would rather wait him out and starve him out than fight him out <\s>
<s> fabius fought hannibal sceptically <\s>
<s> who was his roman coadjutor whom we read of in plutarch when we were boys who scoffed at the other's procrastination and doubted his courage and engaged the enemy and was beaten for his pains <\s>
<s> in these speculations and confessions of arthur the reader may perhaps see allusions to questions which no doubt have occupied and discomposed himself and which he has answered by very different solutions to those come to by our friend <\s>
<s> we are not pledging ourselves for the correctness of his opinions which readers will please to consider are delivered dramatically the writer being no more answerable for them than for the sentiments uttered by any other character of the story our endeavour is merely to follow out in its progress the development of the mind of a worldly and selfish but not ungenerous or unkind or truth avoiding man <\s>
<s> and it will be seen that the lamentable stage to which his logic at present has brought him is one of general scepticism and sneering acquiescence in the world as it is or if you like so to call it a belief qualified with scorn in all things extant <\s>
<s> the tastes and habits of such a man prevent him from being a boisterous demagogue and his love of truth and dislike of cant keep him from advancing crude propositions such as many loud reformers are constantly ready with much more of uttering downright falsehoods in arguing questions or abusing opponents which he would die or starve rather than use <\s>
<s> it was not in our friend's nature to be able to utter certain lies nor was he strong enough to protest against others except with a polite sneer his maxim being that he owed obedience to all acts of parliament as long as they were not repealed <\s>
<s> and to what does this easy and sceptical life lead a man <\s>
<s> friend arthur was a sadducee and the baptist might be in the wilderness shouting to the poor who were listening with all their might and faith to the preacher's awful accents and denunciations of wrath or woe or salvation and our friend the sadducee would turn his sleek mule with a shrug and a smile from the crowd and go home to the shade of his terrace and muse over preacher and audience and turn to his roll of plato or his pleasant greek songbook babbling of honey and hybla and nymphs and fountains and love <\s>
<s> to what we say does this scepticism lead <\s>
<s> it leads a man to a shameful loneliness and selfishness so to speak the more shameful because it is so good humoured and conscienceless and serene <\s>
<s> what is public or private faith <\s>
<s> mythuses alike enveloped in enormous tradition <\s>
<s> if seeing and acknowledging the lies of the world arthur as see them you can with only too fatal a clearness you submit to them without any protest further than a laugh if plunged yourself in easy sensuality you allow the whole wretched world to pass groaning by you unmoved if the fight for the truth is taking place and all men of honour are on the ground armed on the one side or the other and you alone are to lie on your balcony and smoke your pipe out of the noise and the danger you had better have died or never have been at all than such a sensual coward <\s>
<s> arthur said imperturbably where is the truth <\s>
<s> that is the question between us <\s>
<s> i see it on both sides <\s>
<s> i see it on the conservative side of the house and amongst the radicals and even on the ministerial benches <\s>
<s> i see it in this man who worships by act of parliament and is rewarded with a silk apron and five thousand a year in that man who driven fatally by the remorseless logic of his creed gives up everything friends fame dearest ties closest vanities the respect of an army of churchmen the recognised position of a leader and passes over truth impelled to the enemy in whose ranks he will serve henceforth as a nameless private soldier i see the truth in that man as i do in his brother whose logic drives him to quite a different conclusion and who after having passed a life in vain endeavours to reconcile an irreconcilable book flings it at last down in despair and declares with tearful eyes and hands up to heaven his revolt and recantation <\s>
<s> if the truth is with all these why should i take side with any one of them <\s>
<s> some are called upon to preach let them preach <\s>
<s> of these preachers there are somewhat too many methinks who fancy they have the gift <\s>
<s> but we cannot all be parsons in church that is clear <\s>
<s> some must sit silent and listen or go to sleep mayhap <\s>
<s> have we not all our duties <\s>
<s> the head charity boy blows the bellows the master canes the other boys in the organ loft the clerk sings out amen from the desk and the beadle with the staff opens the door for his reverence who rustles in silk up to the cushion <\s>
<s> i won't cane the boys nay or say amen always or act as the church's champion and warrior in the shape of the beadle with the staff but i will take off my hat in the place and say my prayers there too and shake hands with the clergyman as he steps on the grass outside <\s>
<s> don't i know that his being there is a compromise and that he stands before me an act of parliament <\s>

<s> yes i am a sadducee and i take things as i find them and the world and the acts of parliament of the world as they are and as i intend to take a wife if i find one not to be madly in love and prostrate at her feet like a fool not to worship her as an angel or to expect to find her as such but to be good natured to her and courteous expecting good nature and pleasant society from her in turn <\s>
<s> and so george if ever you hear of my marrying depend on it it won't be a romantic attachment on my side and if you hear of any good place under government i have no particular scruples that i know of which would prevent me from accepting your offer <\s>

<s> the information regarding the affairs of the clavering family which major pendennis had acquired through strong and by his own personal interference as the friend of the house was such as almost made the old gentleman pause in any plans which he might have once entertained for his nephew's benefit <\s>
<s> to bestow upon arthur a wife with two such fathers in law as the two worthies whom the guileless and unfortunate lady clavering had drawn in her marriage ventures was to benefit no man <\s>
<s> and though the one in a manner neutralised the other and the appearance of amory or altamont in public would be the signal for his instantaneous withdrawal and condign punishment for the fugitive convict had cut down the officer in charge of him and a rope would be inevitably his end if he came again under british authorities yet no guardian would like to secure for his ward a wife whose parent was to be got rid of in such a way and the old gentleman's notion always had been that altamont with the gallows before his eyes would assuredly avoid recognition while at the same time by holding the threat of his discovery over clavering the latter who would lose everything by amory's appearance would be a slave in the hands of the person who knew so fatal a secret <\s>
<s> but if the begum paid clavering's debts many times more her wealth would be expended altogether upon this irreclaimable reprobate and her heirs whoever they might be would succeed but to an emptied treasury and miss amory instead of bringing her husband a good income and a seat in parliament would bring to that individual her person only and her pedigree with that lamentable note of sus <\s>
<s> at the name of the last male of her line <\s>
<s> there was however to the old schemer revolving these things in his mind another course yet open the which will appear to the reader who may take the trouble to peruse a conversation which presently ensued between major pendennis and the honourable baronet the member for clavering <\s>
<s> when a man under pecuniary difficulties disappears from among his usual friends and equals dives out of sight as it were from the flock of birds in which he is accustomed to sail it is wonderful at what strange and distant nooks he comes up again for breath <\s>
<s> i have known a pall mall lounger and rotten row buck of no inconsiderable fashion vanish from amongst his comrades of the clubs and the park and be discovered very happy and affable at an eighteenpenny ordinary in billingsgate another gentleman of great learning and wit when outrunning the constable were i to say he was a literary man some critics would vow that i intended to insult the literary profession once sent me his address at a little public house called the fox under the hill down a most darksome and cavernous archway in the strand <\s>
<s> such a man under such misfortunes may have a house but he is never in his house and has an address where letters may be left but only simpletons go with the hopes of seeing him only a few of the faithful know where he is to be found and have the clue to his hiding place <\s>
<s> so after the disputes with his wife and the misfortunes consequent thereon to find sir francis clavering at home was impossible <\s>
<s> ever since i hast him for my book which is fourteen pound he don't come home till three o'clock and purtends to be asleep when i bring his water of a mornin and dodges hout when i'm downstairs mr <\s>
<s> lightfoot remarked to his friend morgan and announced that he should go down to my lady and be butler there and marry his old woman <\s>
<s> in like manner after his altercations with strong the baronet did not come near him and fled to other haunts out of the reach of the chevalier's reproaches out of the reach of conscience if possible which many of us try to dodge and leave behind us by changes of scene and other fugitive stratagems <\s>
<s> so though the elder pendennis having his own ulterior object was bent upon seeing pen's country neighbour and representative in parliament it took the major no inconsiderable trouble and time before he could get him into such a confidential state and conversation as were necessary for the ends which the major had in view <\s>
<s> for since the major had been called in as family friend and had cognisance of clavering's affairs conjugal and pecuniary the baronet avoided him as he always avoided all his lawyers and agents when there was an account to be rendered or an affair of business to be discussed between them and never kept any appointment but when its object was the raising of money <\s>
<s> thus previous to catching this most shy and timorous bird the major made more than one futile attempt to hold him on one day it was a most innocent looking invitation to dinner at greenwich to meet a few friends the baronet accepted suspected something and did not come leaving the major who indeed proposed to represent in himself the body of friends to eat his whitebait alone on another occasion the major wrote and asked for ten minutes talk and the baronet instantly acknowledged the note and made the appointment at four o'clock the next day at bays's precisely he carefully underlined the precisely ); but though four o'clock came as in the course of time and destiny it could not do otherwise no clavering made his appearance <\s>
<s> indeed if he had borrowed twenty pounds of pendennis he could not have been more timid or desirous of avoiding the major and the latter found that it was one thing to seek a man and another to find him <\s>
<s> before the close of that day in which strong's patron had given the chevalier the benefit of so many blessings before his face and curses behind his back sir francis clavering who had pledged his word and his oath to his wife's advisers to draw or accept no more bills of exchange and to be content with the allowance which his victimised wife still awarded him had managed to sign his respectable name to a piece of stamped paper which the baronet's friend mr <\s>
<s> moss abrams had carried off promising to have the bill done by a party with whose intimacy mr <\s>
<s> and it chanced that strong heard of this transaction at the place where the writings had been drawn in the back parlour namely of mr <\s>
<s> santiago's cigar shop where the chevalier was constantly in the habit of spending an hour in the evening <\s>
<s> he is at his old work again mr <\s>
<s> santiago told his customer <\s>
<s> he and moss abrams were in my parlour <\s>
<s> moss sent out my boy for a stamp <\s>
<s> it must have been a bill for fifty pound <\s>
<s> i heard the baronet tell moss to date it two months back <\s>
<s> he will pretend that it is an old bill and that he forgot it when he came to a settlement with his wife the other day <\s>
<s> i dare say they will give him some more money now he is clear <\s>
<s> a man who has the habit of putting his unlucky name to promises to pay at six months has the satisfaction of knowing too that his affairs are known and canvassed and his signature handed round among the very worst knaves and rogues of london <\s>
<s> santiago's shop was close by st <\s>
<s> james's street and bury street where we have had the honour of visiting our friend major pendennis in his lodgings <\s>
<s> the major was walking daintily towards his apartment as strong burning with wrath and redolent of havanna strode along the same pavement opposite to him <\s>
<s> confound these young men how they poison everything with their smoke thought the major <\s>
<s> here comes a fellow with mustachios and a cigar <\s>
<s> every fellow who smokes and wears mustachios is a low fellow <\s>
<s> strong i hope you are well mr <\s>
<s> and the old gentleman making a dignified bow to the chevalier was about to pass into his house directing towards the lock of the door with trembling hand the polished door key <\s>
<s> we have said that at the long and weary disputes and conferences regarding the payment of sir francis clavering's last debts strong and pendennis had both been present as friends and advisers of the baronet's unlucky family <\s>
<s> strong stopped and held out his hand to his brother negotiator and old pendennis put out towards him a couple of ungracious fingers <\s>
<s> what is your good news <\s>
<s> said major pendennis patronising the other still further and condescending to address to him an observation for old pendennis had kept such good company all his life that he vaguely imagined he honoured common men by speaking to them <\s>
<s> still in town mr <\s>
<s> i hope i see you well <\s>
<s> my news is bad news sir strong answered it concerns our friends at tunbridge wells and i should like to talk to you about it <\s>
<s> clavering is at his old tricks again major pendennis <\s>
<s> pray do me the favour to come into my lodging cried the major with awakened interest and the pair entered and took possession of his drawing room <\s>
<s> here seated strong unburthened himself of his indignation to the major and spoke at large of clavering's recklessness and treachery <\s>
<s> no promises will bind him sir he said <\s>
<s> you remember when we met sir with my lady's lawyer how he wouldn't be satisfied with giving his honour but wanted to take his oath on his knees to his wife and rang the bell for a bible and swore perdition on his soul if he ever would give another bill <\s>
<s> he has been signing one this very day sir and will sign as many more as you please for ready money and will deceive anybody his wife or his child or his old friend who has backed him a hundred times <\s>
<s> why there's a bill of his and mine will be due next week <\s>
<s> i thought we had paid all <\s>
<s> not that one strong said blushing <\s>
<s> he asked me not to mention it and and i had half the money for that major and they will be down on me <\s>
<s> but i don't care for it i'm used to it <\s>
<s> it's lady clavering that riles me <\s>
<s> it's a shame that that good natured woman who has paid him out of gaol a score of times should be ruined by his heartlessness <\s>
<s> a parcel of bill stealers boxers any rascals get his money and he don't scruple to throw an honest fellow over <\s>
<s> would you believe it sir he took money of altamont you know whom i mean <\s>
<s> of that singular man who i think came tipsy once to sir francis's house <\s>
<s> major pendennis said with impenetrable countenance <\s>
<s> who is altamont mr <\s>
<s> i am sure i don't know if you don't know the chevalier answered with a look of surprise and suspicion <\s>
<s> to tell you frankly said the major i have my suspicions i suppose mind i only suppose that in our friend clavering's a life who between you and me captain strong we must own about as loose a fish as any in my acquaintance there are no doubt some queer secrets and stories which he would not like to have known none of us would <\s>
<s> and very likely this fellow who calls himself altamont knows some story against clavering and has some hold on him and gets money out of him on the strength of his information <\s>
<s> i know some of the best men of the best families in england who are paying through the nose in that way <\s>
<s> but their private affairs are no business of mine mr <\s>
<s> strong and it is not to be supposed that because i go and dine with a man i pry into his secrets or am answerable for all his past life <\s>
<s> and so with our friend clavering i am most interested for his wife's sake and her daughter's who is a most charming creature and when her ladyship asked me i looked into her affairs and tried to set them straight and shall do so again you understand to the best of my humble power and ability if i can make myself useful <\s>
<s> and if i am called upon you understand if i am called upon and by the way this mr <\s>
<s> how is this mr <\s>
<s> i believe you are acquainted with him <\s>
<s> is he in town <\s>
<s> i don't know that i am called upon to know where he is major pendennis said strong rising and taking up his hat in dudgeon for the major's patronising manner and impertinence of caution offended the honest gentleman not a little <\s>
<s> pendennis's manner altered at once from a tone of hauteur to one of knowing good humour <\s>
<s> ah captain strong you are cautious too i see and quite right my good sir quite right <\s>
<s> we don't know what ears walls may have sir or to whom we may be talking and as a man of the world and an old soldier an old and distinguished soldier i have been told captain strong you know very well that there is no use in throwing away your fire you may have your ideas and i may put two and two together and have mine <\s>
<s> but there are things which don't concern him that many a man had better not know eh captain <\s>
<s> and which i for one won't know until i have reason for knowing them and that i believe is your maxim too <\s>
<s> with regard to our friend the baronet i think with you it would be most advisable that he should be checked in his imprudent courses and most strongly reprehend any man's departure from his word or any conduct of his which can give any pain to his family or cause them annoyance in any way <\s>
<s> that is my full and frank opinion and i am sure it is yours <\s>
<s> i am delighted to hear it delighted that an old brother soldier should agree with me so fully <\s>
<s> and i am exceedingly glad of the lucky meeting which has procured me the good fortune of your visit <\s>
<s> morgan show the door to captain strong <\s>
<s> and strong preceded by morgan took his leave of major pendennis the chevalier not a little puzzled at the old fellow's prudence and the valet to say the truth to the full as much perplexed at his master's reticence <\s>
<s> morgan in his capacity of accomplished valet moved here and there in a house as silent as a shadow and as it so happened during the latter part of his master's conversation with his visitor had been standing very close to the door and had overheard not a little of the talk between the two gentlemen and a great deal more than he could understand <\s>
<s> who is that altamont <\s>
<s> know anything about him and strong <\s>
<s> morgan asked of mr <\s>
<s> lightfoot on the next convenient occasion when they met at the club <\s>
<s> strong's his man of business draws the governor's bills and indosses em and does his odd jobs and that and i suppose altamont's in it too mr <\s>
<s> that kite flying you know mr <\s>
<s> m always takes two or three on em to set the paper going <\s>
<s> altamont put the pot on at the derby and won a good bit of money <\s>
<s> i wish the governor could get some somewhere and i could get my book paid up <\s>
<s> do you think my lady would pay his debts again <\s>
<s> find out that for me lightfoot and i'll make it worth your while my boy <\s>
<s> major pendennis had often said with a laugh that his vale morgan was a much richer man than himself and indeed by long course of careful speculation this wary and silent attendant had been amassing a considerable sum of money during the year which he had passed in the major's service where he had made the acquaintance of many other valets of distinction from whom he had learned the affairs of their principals <\s>
<s> arthur came into his property but not until then morgan had surprised the young gentleman by saying that he had a little sum of money some fifty or a hundred pound which he wanted to lay out to advantage perhaps the gentlemen in the temple knowing about affairs and business and that could help a poor fellow to a good investment <\s>
<s> morgan would be very much obliged to mr <\s>
<s> arthur most grateful and obliged indeed if arthur could tell him of one <\s>
<s> when arthur laughingly replied that he knew nothing about money matters and knew no earthly way of helping morgan the latter with the utmost simplicity was very grateful very grateful indeed to mr <\s>
<s> arthur and if mr <\s>
<s> arthur should want a little money before his rents was paid perhaps he would kindly remember that his uncle's old and faithful servant had some as he would like to put out and be most proud if he could be useful anyways to any of the family <\s>
<s> the prince of fairoaks who was tolerably prudent and had no need of ready money would as soon have thought of borrowing from his uncle's servant as of stealing the valet's pocket handkerchief and was on the point of making some haughty reply to morgan's offer but was checked by the humour of the transaction <\s>
<s> morgan offering to lend to him the joke was excellent <\s>
<s> on the other hand the man might be quite innocent and the proposal of money a simple offer of good will <\s>
<s> so arthur withheld the sarcasm that was rising to his lips and contented himself by declining mr <\s>
<s> he mentioned the matter to his uncle however and congratulated the latter on having such a treasure in his service <\s>
<s> it was then that the major said that he believed morgan had been getting devilish rich for a devilish long time in fact he had bought the house in bury street in which his master was a lodger and had actually made a considerable sum of money from his acquaintance with the clavering family and his knowledge obtained through his master that the begum would pay all her husband's debts by buying up as many of the baronet's acceptances as he could raise money to purchase <\s>
<s> of these transactions the major however knew no more than most gentlemen do of their servants who live with us all our days and are strangers to us so strong custom is and so pitiless the distinction between class and class <\s>
<s> so he offered to lend you money did he <\s>
<s> the elder pendennis remarked to his nephew <\s>
<s> he's a dev'lish sly fellow and a dev'lish rich fellow and there's many a nobleman would like to have such a valet in his service and borrow from him too <\s>
<s> and he ain't a bit changed monsieur morgan <\s>
<s> he does his work just as well as ever he's always ready to my bell steals about the room like a cat he's so dev'lishly attached to me morgan <\s>
<s> on the day of strong's visit the major bethought him of pen's story and that morgan might help him and rallied the valet regarding his wealth with that free and insolent way which so high placed a gentleman might be disposed to adopt towards so unfortunate a creature <\s>
<s> i hear that you have got some money to invest morgan said the major <\s>
<s> arthur has been telling hang him thought the valet <\s>
<s> i'm glad my place is such a good one <\s>
<s> thank you sir i've no reason to complain of my place nor of my master replied morgan demurely <\s>
<s> you're a good fellow and i believe you are attached to me and i'm glad you get on well <\s>
<s> and i hope you'll be prudent and not be taking a public house or that kind of thing <\s>
<s> a public house thought morgan me in a public house the old fool dammy if i was ten years younger i'd set in parlyment before i died that i would no thank you kindly sir <\s>
<s> i don't think of the public line sir <\s>
<s> and i've got my little savings pretty well put out sir <\s>
<s> you do a little in the discounting way eh morgan <\s>
<s> yes sir a very little i i beg your pardon sir might i be so free as to ask a question speak on my good fellow the elder said graciously <\s>
<s> about sir francis clavering's paper sir <\s>
<s> do you think he's any longer any good sir <\s>
<s> will my lady pay on em any more sir <\s>
<s> what you've done something in that business already <\s>
<s> yes sir a little replied morgan dropping down his eyes <\s>
<s> and i don't mind owning sir and i hope i may take the liberty of saying sir that a little more would make me very comfortable if it turned out as well as the last <\s>
<s> why how much have you netted by him in gad's name <\s>
<s> i've done a good bit sir at it that i own sir <\s>
<s> having some information and made acquaintance with the fam'ly through your kindness i put on the pot sir <\s>
<s> i laid my money on sir i got all i could and borrowed and bought sir francis's bills many of em had his name and the gentleman's as is just gone out edward strong esquire sir and of course i know of the blow hup and shindy as is took place in grosvenor place sir and as i may as well make my money as another i'd be very much obleeged to you if you'd tell me whether my lady will come down any more <\s>
<s> although major pendennis was as much surprised at this intelligence regarding his servant as if he had heard that morgan was a disguised marquis about to throw off his mask and assume his seat in the house of peers and although he was of course indignant at the audacity of the fellow who had dared to grow rich under his nose and without his cognisance yet he had a natural admiration for every man who represented money and success and found himself respecting morgan and being rather afraid of that worthy as the truth began to dawn upon him <\s>
<s> well morgan said he i mustn't ask how rich you are and the richer the better for your sake i'm sure <\s>
<s> and if i could give you any information that could serve you i would speedily help you <\s>
<s> but frankly if lady clavering asks me whether she shall pay any more of sir francis's debts i shall advise and i hope she won't though i fear she will and that is all i know <\s>
<s> and so you are aware that sir francis is beginning again in his eh reckless and imprudent course <\s>
<s> at his old games sir can't prevent that gentleman <\s>
<s> he will do it <\s>
<s> strong was saying that a mr <\s>
<s> moss abrams was the holder of one of sir francis clavering's notes <\s>
<s> do you know anything of this mr <\s>
<s> abrams or the amount of the bill <\s>
<s> don't know the bill know abrams quite well sir <\s>
<s> i wish you would find out about it for me <\s>
<s> and i wish you would find out where i can see sir francis clavering morgan <\s>
<s> and morgan said thank you sir yes sir i will sir and retired from the room as he had entered it with his usual stealthy respect and quiet humility leaving the major to muse and wonder over what he had just heard <\s>
<s> the next morning the valet informed major pendennis that he had seen mr <\s>
<s> abrams what was the amount of the bill that gentleman was desirous to negotiate and that the baronet would be sure to be in the back parlour of the wheel of fortune tavern that day at one o'clock <\s>
<s> to this appointment sir francis clavering was punctual and as at one o'clock he sate in the parlour of the tavern in question surrounded by spittoons windsor chairs cheerful prints of boxers trotting horses and pedestrians and the lingering of last night's tobacco fumes as the descendant of an ancient line sate in this delectable place accommodated with an old copy of bell's life in london much blotted with beer the polite major pendennis walked into the apartment <\s>
<s> so it's you old boy <\s>
<s> asked the baronet thinking that mr <\s>
<s> moss abrams had arrived with the money <\s>
<s> how do you do sir francis clavering <\s>
<s> i wanted to see you and followed you here said the major at sight of whom the other's countenance fell <\s>
<s> now that he had his opponent before him the major was determined to make a brisk and sudden attack upon him and went into action at once <\s>
<s> i know he continued who is the exceedingly disreputable person for whom you took me clavering and the errand which brought you here <\s>
<s> it ain't your business is it <\s>
<s> asked the baronet with a sulky and deprecatory look <\s>
<s> why are you following me about and taking the command and meddling in my affairs major pendennis <\s>
<s> i've never done you any harm have i <\s>
<s> i've never had your money <\s>
<s> and i don't choose to be dodged about in this way and domineered over <\s>
<s> i don't choose it and i won't have it <\s>
<s> if lady clavering has any proposal to make to me let it be done in the regular way and through the lawyers <\s>
<s> i'd rather not have you <\s>
<s> i am not come from lady clavering the major said but of my own accord to try and remonstrate with you clavering and see if you can be kept from ruin <\s>
<s> it is but a month ago that you swore on your honour and wanted to get a bible to strengthen the oath that you would accept no more bills but content yourself with the allowance which lady clavering gives you <\s>
<s> all your debts were paid with that proviso and you have broken it this mr <\s>
<s> abrams has a bill of yours for sixty pounds <\s>
<s> it's an old bill <\s>
<s> i take my solemn oath it's an old bill shrieked out the baronet <\s>
<s> you drew it yesterday and you dated it three months back purposely <\s>
<s> by gad clavering you sicken me with lies i can't help telling you so <\s>
<s> i've no patience with you by gad <\s>
<s> you cheat everybody yourself included <\s>
<s> i've seen a deal of the world but i never met your equal at humbugging <\s>
<s> it's my belief you had rather lie than not <\s>
<s> have you come here you old old beast to tempt me to to pitch into you and and knock your old head off <\s>
<s> said the baronet with a poisonous look of hatred at the major <\s>
<s> shouted out the old major rising to his feet and clasping his cane and looking so fiercely that the baronet's tone instantly changed towards him <\s>
<s> no no said clavering piteously i beg your pardon <\s>
<s> i didn't mean to be angry or say anything unkind only you're so damned harsh to me major pendennis <\s>
<s> what is it you want of me <\s>
<s> why have you been hunting me so <\s>
<s> do you want money out of me too <\s>
<s> by jove you know i've not got a shilling and so clavering according to his custom passed from a curse into a whimper <\s>
<s> major pendennis saw from the other's tone that clavering knew his secret was in the major's hands <\s>
<s> i've no errand from anybody or no design upon you pendennis said but an endeavour if it's not too late to save you and your family from utter ruin through the infernal recklessness of your courses <\s>
<s> i knew your secret i didn't know it when i married her upon my oath i didn't know it till the d  d scoundrel came back and told me himself and it's the misery about that which makes me so reckless pendennis indeed it is the baronet cried clasping his hands <\s>
<s> i knew your secret from the very first day when i saw amory come drunk into your dining room in grosvenor place <\s>
<s> i never forget faces <\s>
<s> i remember that fellow in sydney a convict and he remembers me <\s>
<s> i know his trial the date of his marriage and of his reported death in the bush <\s>
<s> i could swear to him <\s>
<s> and i know that you are no more married to lady clavering than i am <\s>
<s> i've kept your secret well enough for i've not told a single soul that i know it not your wife not yourself till now <\s>
<s> poor lady c it would cut her up dreadfully whimpered sir francis and it wasn't my fault major you know it wasn't <\s>
<s> rather than allow you to go on ruining her as you do; i will tell her clavering and tell all the world too that is what i swear i will do unless i can come to some terms with you and put some curb on your infernal folly <\s>
<s> by play debt and extravagance of all kind you've got through half your wife's fortune and that of her legitimate heirs mind her legitimate heirs <\s>
<s> here it must stop <\s>
<s> you can't live together <\s>
<s> you're not fit to live in a great house like clavering and before three years more were over would not leave a shilling to carry on <\s>
<s> i've settled what must be done <\s>
<s> you shall have six hundred a year you shall go abroad and live on that <\s>
<s> you must give up parliament and get on as well as you can <\s>
<s> if you refuse i give you my word i'll make the real state of things known to morrow i'll swear to amory who when identified will go back to the country from whence he came and will rid the widow of you and himself together <\s>
<s> and so that boy of yours loses at once all title to old spell's property and it goes to your wife's daughter <\s>
<s> ain't i making myself pretty clearly understood <\s>
<s> you wouldn't be so cruel to that poor boy would you pendennis <\s>
<s> asked the father pleading piteously hang it think about him <\s>
<s> he's a nice boy though he's dev'lish wild i own he's dev'lish wild <\s>
<s> it's you who are cruel to him said the old moralist <\s>
<s> why sir you'll ruin him yourself inevitably in three years <\s>
<s> yes but perhaps i won't have such dev'lish bad luck you know the luck must turn and i'll reform by gad i'll reform <\s>
<s> and if you were to split on me it would cut up my wife so you know it would most infernally <\s>
<s> to be parted from you said the old major with a sneer you know she won't live with you again <\s>
<s> but why can't lady c <\s>
<s> live abroad or at bath or at tunbridge or at the doose and i go on here <\s>
<s> i like being here better than abroad and i like being in parliament <\s>
<s> it's dev'lish convenient being in parliament <\s>
<s> there's very few seats like mine left and if i gave it to em i should not wonder the ministry would give me an island to govern or some dev'lish good thing for you know i'm a gentleman of dev'lish good family and have a handle to my name and and that sort of thing major pendennis <\s>
<s> eh don't you see <\s>
<s> don't you think they'd give me something dev'lish good if i was to play my cards well <\s>
<s> and then you know i'd save money and be kept out of the way of the confounded hells and rouge et noir and and so i'd rather not give up parliament please <\s>
<s> for at one instant to hate and defy a man at the next to weep before him and at the next to be perfectly confidential and friendly with him was not an unusual process with our versatile minded baronet <\s>
<s> as for your seat in parliament the major said with something of a blush on his cheek and a certain tremor which the other did not see you must part with that sir francis clavering to to me <\s>
<s> are you going into the house major pendennis <\s>
<s> no not i but my nephew arthur is a very clever fellow and would make a figure there and when clavering had two members his father might very likely have been one and and should like arthur to be there the major said <\s>
<s> dammy does he know it too <\s>
<s> nobody knows anything out of this room pendennis answered and if you do this favour for me i hold my tongue <\s>
<s> if not i'm a man of my word and will do what i have said <\s>
<s> i say major said sir francis with a peculiarly humble smile you you couldn't get me my first quarter in advance could you like the best of fellows <\s>
<s> you can do anything with lady clavering and upon my oath i'll take up that bill of abrams <\s>
<s> the little dam scoundrel i know he'll do me in the business he always does and if you could do this for me we'd see major <\s>
<s> and i think your best plan would be to go down in september to clavering to shoot and take my nephew with you and introduce him <\s>
<s> yes that will be the best time <\s>
<s> and we will try and manage about the advance <\s>
<s> arthur may lend him that thought old pendennis <\s>
<s> confound him a seat in parliament is worth a hundred and fifty pounds and clavering you understand of course my nephew knows nothing about this business <\s>
<s> you have a mind to retire he is a clavering man and a good representative for the borough you introduce him and your people vote for him you see <\s>
<s> when can you get me the hundred and fifty major <\s>
<s> when shall i come and see you <\s>
<s> will you be at home this evening or to morrow morning <\s>
<s> will you have anything here <\s>
<s> they've got some dev'lish good bitters in the bar <\s>
<s> i often have a glass of bitters it sets one up so <\s>
<s> the old major would take no refreshment but rose and took his leave of the baronet who walked with him to the door of the wheel of fortune and then strolled into the bar where he took a glass of gin and bitters with the landlady there and a gentleman connected with the ring who boarded at the wheel of f coming in he and sir francis clavering and the landlord talked about the fights and the news of the sporting world in general and at length mr <\s>
<s> moss abrams arrived with the proceeds of the baronet's bill from which his own handsome commission was deducted and out of the remainder sir francis stood a dinner at greenwich to his distinguished friend and passed the evening gaily at vauxhall <\s>
<s> meanwhile major pendennis calling a cab in piccadilly drove to lamb court temple where he speedily was closeted with his nephew in deep conversation <\s>
<s> after their talk they parted on very good terms and it was in consequence of that unreported conversation whereof the reader nevertheless can pretty well guess the bearing that arthur expressed himself as we have heard in the colloquy with warrington which is reported in the last chapter <\s>
<s> when a man is tempted to do a tempting thing he can find a hundred ingenious reasons for gratifying his liking and arthur thought very much that he would like to be in parliament and that he would like to distinguish himself there and that he need not care much what side he took as there was falsehood and truth on every side <\s>
<s> and on this and on other matters he thought he would compromise with his conscience and that sadduceeism was a very convenient and good humoured profession of faith <\s>
<s> phyllis and corydon on a picturesque common in the neighbourhood of tunbridge wells lady clavering had found a pretty villa whither she retired after her conjugal disputes at the end of that unlucky london season <\s>
<s> miss amory of course accompanied her mother and master clavering came home for the holidays with whom blanche's chief occupation was to fight and quarrel <\s>
<s> but this was only a home pastime and the young schoolboy was not fond of home sports <\s>
<s> he found cricket and horses and plenty of friends at tunbridge <\s>
<s> the good natured begum's house was filled with a constant society of young gentlemen of thirteen who ate and drank much too copiously of tarts and champagne who rode races on the lawn and frightened the fond mother who smoked and made themselves sick and the dining room unbearable to miss blanche <\s>
<s> she did not like the society of young gentlemen of thirteen <\s>
<s> as for that fair young creature any change as long as it was change was pleasant to her and for a week or two she would have liked poverty and a cottage and bread and cheese and for a night perhaps a dungeon and bread and water and so the move to tunbridge was by no means unwelcome to her <\s>
<s> she wandered in the woods and sketched trees and farmhouses she read french novels habitually she drove into tunbridge wells pretty often and to any play or ball or conjurer or musician who might happen to appear in the place she slept a great deal she quarrelled with mamma and frank during the morning she found the little village school and attended it and first fondled the girls and thwarted the mistress then scolded the girls and laughed at the teacher she was constant at church of course <\s>
<s> it was a pretty little church of immense antiquity a little anglo norman bijou built the day before yesterday and decorated with all sorts of painted windows carved saints heads gilt scripture texts and open pews <\s>
<s> blanche began forthwith to work a most correct high church altar cover for the church <\s>
<s> she passed for a saint with the clergyman for a while whom she quite took in and whom she coaxed and wheedled and fondled so artfully that poor mrs <\s>
<s> smirke who at first was charmed with her then bore with her then would hardly speak to her was almost mad with jealousy <\s>
<s> smirke was the wife of our old friend smirke pen's tutor and poor helen's suitor <\s>
<s> he had consoled himself for her refusal with a young lady from clapham whom his mamma provided <\s>
<s> when the latter died our friend's views became every day more and more pronounced <\s>
<s> he cut off his coat collar and let his hair grow over his back <\s>
<s> he rigorously gave up the curl which he used to sport on his forehead and the tie of his neckcloth of which he was rather proud <\s>
<s> he went without any tie at all <\s>
<s> he went without dinner on fridays <\s>
<s> he read the roman hours and intimated that he was ready to receive confessions in the vestry <\s>
<s> the most harmless creature in the world he was denounced as a black and most dangerous jesuit and papist by muffin of the dissenting chapel and mr <\s>
<s> simeon knight at the old church <\s>
<s> smirke had built his chapel of ease with the money left him by his mother at clapham <\s>
<s> what would she have said to hear a table called an altar <\s>
<s> to see candlesticks on it <\s>
<s> to get letters signed on the feast of saint so and so or the vigil of saint what do you call 'em <\s>
<s> all these things did the boy of clapham practise his faithful wife following him <\s>
<s> but when blanche had a conference of near two hours in the vestry with mr <\s>
<s> smirke belinda paced up and down on the grass where there were only two little grave stones as yet she wished that she had a third there only only he would offer very likely to that creature who had infatuated him in a fortnight <\s>
<s> no she would retire she would go into a convent and profess and leave him <\s>
<s> such bad thoughts had smirke's wife and his neighbours regarding him these thinking him in direct correspondence with the bishop of rome that bewailing errors to her even more odious and fatal and yet our friend meant no earthly harm <\s>
<s> the post office never brought him any letters from the pope he thought blanche to be sure at first the most pious gifted right thinking fascinating person he had ever met and her manner of singing the chants delighted him but after a while he began to grow rather tired of miss amory her ways and graces grew stale somehow then he was doubtful about miss amory then she made a disturbance in his school lost her temper and rapped the children's fingers <\s>
<s> blanche inspired this admiration and satiety somehow in many men <\s>
<s> she tried to please them and flung out all her graces at once came down to them with all her jewels on all her smiles and cajoleries and coaxings and ogles <\s>
<s> then she grew tired of them and of trying to please them and never having cared about them dropped them and the men grew tired of her and dropped her too <\s>
<s> it was a happy night for belinda when blanche went away and her husband with rather a blush and a sigh said he had been deceived in her he had thought her endowed with many precious gifts he feared they were mere tinsel he thought she had been a right thinking person he feared she had merely made religion an amusement she certainly had quite lost her temper to the schoolmistress and beat polly rucker's knuckles cruelly <\s>
<s> belinda flew to his arms there was no question about the grave or the veil any more <\s>
<s> he tenderly embraced her on the forehead <\s>
<s> there is none like thee my belinda he said throwing his fine eyes up to the ceiling precious among women <\s>
<s> as for blanche from the instant she lost sight of him and belinda she never thought or cared about either any more <\s>
<s> but when arthur went down to pass a few days at tunbridge wells with the begum this stage of indifference had not arrived on miss blanche's part or on that of the simple clergyman <\s>
<s> smirke believed her to be an angel and wonder of a woman <\s>
<s> such a perfection he had never seen and sate listening to her music in the summer evenings open mouthed rapt in wonder tea less and bread and butter less <\s>
<s> fascinating as he had heard the music of the opera to be he had never but once attended an exhibition of that nature which he mentioned with a blush and a sigh it was on that day when he had accompanied helen and her son to the play at chatteris he could not conceive anything more delicious more celestial he had almost said than miss amory's music <\s>
<s> she was a most gifted being she had a precious soul she had the most remarkable talents to all outward seeming the most heavenly disposition etc <\s>
<s> it was in this way that being then at the height of his own fever and bewitchment for blanche smirke discoursed to arthur about her <\s>

<s> smirke a most exemplary person seconded them with all her endeavours <\s>
<s> he had built this little church on his mother's demise who had left him provided with a sufficiency of worldly means <\s>
<s> though in the cloister himself he had heard of arthur's reputation <\s>
<s> he spoke in the kindest and most saddened tone he held his eyelids down and bowed his fair head on one side <\s>
<s> arthur was immensely amused with him with his airs with his follies and simplicity with his blank stock and long hair with his real goodness kindness friendliness of feeling <\s>
<s> and his praises of blanche pleased and surprised our friend not a little and made him regard her with eyes of particular favour <\s>
<s> the truth is blanche was very glad to see arthur as one is glad to see an agreeable man in the country who brings down the last news and stories from the great city who can talk better than most country folks at least can talk that darling london jargon so dear and indispensable to london people so little understood by persons out of the world <\s>
<s> the first day pen came down he kept blanche laughing for hours after dinner <\s>

<s> when it came to be bedtime she said deja <\s>
<s> with the prettiest air of regret possible and was really quite sorry to go to bed and squeezed arthur's hand quite fondly <\s>
<s> he on his side gave her pretty palm a very cordial pressure <\s>
<s> our young gentleman was of that turn that eyes very moderately bright dazzled him <\s>
<s> she is very much improved thought pen looking out into the night very much <\s>
<s> i suppose the begum won't mind my smoking with the window open <\s>
<s> she's a jolly good old woman and blanche is immensely improved <\s>
<s> i liked her manner with her mother tonight <\s>
<s> i liked her laughing way with that stupid young cub of a boy whom they oughtn't to allow to get tipsy <\s>
<s> she sang those little verses very prettily they were devilish pretty verses too though i say it who shouldn't say it <\s>
<s> and he hummed a tune which blanche had put to some verses of his own <\s>
<s> what a fine night <\s>
<s> how jolly a cigar is at night <\s>
<s> how pretty that little saxon church looks in the moonlight <\s>
<s> i wonder what old warrington's doing <\s>
<s> yes she's a dayvlish nice little thing as my uncle says <\s>
<s> here broke out a voice from a clematis covered casement near a girl's voice it was the voice of the author of mes larmes <\s>
<s> pen burst into a laugh <\s>
<s> don't tell about my smoking he said leaning out of his own window <\s>
<s> i adore it cried the lady of mes larmes <\s>
<s> but i must shut my window and not talk to you on account of les moeurs <\s>
<s> how droll they are les moeurs <\s>
<s> and pen began to sing the goodnight to don basilio <\s>
<s> the next day they were walking in the fields together laughing and chattering the gayest pair of friends <\s>
<s> they talked about the days of their youth and blanche was prettily sentimental <\s>
<s> they talked about laura dearest laura blanche had loved her as a sister was she happy with that odd lady rockminster <\s>
<s> wouldn't she come and stay with them at tunbridge <\s>
<s> oh what walks they would take together <\s>
<s> what songs they would sing the old old songs <\s>
<s> laura's voice was splendid <\s>
<s> did arthur she must call him arthur remember the songs they sang in the happy old days now he was grown such a great man and had such a succes <\s>
<s> and the day after which was enlivened with a happy ramble through the woods to penshurst and a sight of that pleasant park and hall came that conversation with the curate which we have narrated and which made our young friend think more and more <\s>

<s> has she become serious and religious <\s>
<s> does she tend schools and visit the poor <\s>
<s> is she kind to her mother and brother <\s>
<s> yes i am sure of that i have seen her <\s>
<s> and walking with his old tutor over his little parish and going to visit his school it was with inexpressible delight that pen found blanche seated instructing the children and fancied to himself how patient she must be how good natured how ingenuous how really simple in her tastes and unspoiled by the world <\s>
<s> and do you really like the country <\s>
<s> he asked her as they walked together <\s>
<s> i should like never to see that odious city again <\s>
<s> o arthur that is mr well arthur then one's good thoughts grow up in these sweet woods and calm solitudes like those flowers which won't bloom in london you know <\s>
<s> the gardener comes and changes our balconies once a week <\s>
<s> i don't think i shall bear to look london in the face again its odious smoky brazen face <\s>
<s> why that sigh blanche <\s>
<s> yes i do mind why <\s>
<s> tell me tell me everything <\s>
<s> i wish you hadn't come down and a second edition of mes soupirs came out <\s>
<s> you don't want me blanche <\s>
<s> i don't want you to go away <\s>
<s> i don't think this house will be very happy without you and that's why i wish that you never had come <\s>
<s> mes soupirs were here laid aside and mes larmes had begun <\s>
<s> what answer is given to those in the eyes of a young woman <\s>
<s> what is the method employed for drying them <\s>
<s> o ringdoves and roses o dews and wildflowers o waving greenwoods and balmy airs of summer <\s>
<s> here were two battered london rakes taking themselves in for a moment and fancying that they were in love with each other like phillis and corydon <\s>
<s> when one thinks of country houses and country walks one wonders that any man is left unmarried <\s>
<s> temptation easy and frank spoken as pendennis commonly was with warrington how came it that arthur did not inform the friend and depository of all his secrets of the little circumstances which had taken place at the villa near tunbridge wells <\s>
<s> he talked about the discovery of his old tutor smirke freely enough and of his wife and of his anglo norman church and of his departure from clapha to rome but when asked about blanche his answers were evasive or general he said she was a good natured clever little thing that rightly guided she make no such bad wife after all but that he had for the moment no intention of marriage that his days of romance were over that he was contented with his present lot and so forth <\s>
<s> in the meantime there came occasionally to lamb court temple pretty little satin envelopes superscribed in the neatest handwriting and sealed with one of those admirable ciphers which if warrington had been curious enough to watch his friend's letters or indeed if the cipher had been decipherable would have shown george that mr <\s>
<s> arthur was in correspondence with a young lady whose initials were b <\s>
<s> to these pretty little compositions mr <\s>
<s> pen replied in his best and gallantest manner with jokes with news of the town with points of wit nay with pretty little verses very likely in reply to the versicles of the muse of mes larmes <\s>
<s> blanche we know rhymes with branch and stanch and launch and no doubt a gentleman of pen's ingenuity would not forgo these advantages of position and would ring the pretty little changes upon these pleasing notes <\s>
<s> indeed we believe that those love verses of mr <\s>
<s> pen's which had such a pleasing success in the roseleaves that charming annual edited by lady violet lebas and illustrated by portraits of the female nobility by the famous artist pinkney were composed at this period of our hero's life and were first addressed to blanche per post before they figured in print cornets as it were to pinkney's pictorial garland <\s>
<s> verses are all very well the elder pendennis said who found pen scratching down one of these artless effusions at the club as he was waiting for his dinner and letter writing if mamma allows it and between such old country friends of course there may be a correspondence and that sort of thing but mind pen and don't commit yourself my boy <\s>
<s> for who knows what the doose may happen <\s>
<s> the best way is to make your letters safe <\s>
<s> i never wrote a letter in all my life that would commit me and demmy sir i have had some experience of women <\s>
<s> and the worthy gentleman growing more garrulous and confidential with his nephew as he grew older told many affecting instances of the evil results consequent upon this want of caution to many persons in society how from using too ardent expressions in some poetical notes to the widow naylor young spoony had subjected himself to a visit of remonstrance from the widow's brother colonel flint and thus had been forced into a marriage with a woman old enough to be his mother how when louisa salter had at length succeeded in securing young sir john bird hopwood of the blues produced some letters which miss s <\s>
<s> had written to him and caused a withdrawal on bird's part who afterwards was united to miss stickney of lyme regis etc <\s>
<s> the major if he had not reading had plenty of observation and could back his wise saws with a multitude of modern instances which he had acquired in a long and careful perusal of the great book of the world <\s>
<s> pen laughed at the examples and blushing a little at his uncle's remonstrances said that he would bear them in mind and be cautious <\s>
<s> he blushed perhaps because he had borne them in mind because he was cautious because in his letters to miss blanche he had from instinct or honesty perhaps refrained from any avowals which might compromise him <\s>
<s> don't you remember the lesson i had sir in lady mirabel's miss fotheringay's affair <\s>
<s> i am not to be caught again uncle arthur said with mock frankness and humility <\s>
<s> old pendennis congratulated himself and his nephew heartily on the latter's prudence and progress and was pleased at the position which arthur was taking as a man of the world <\s>
<s> no doubt if warrington had been consulted his opinion would have been different and he would have told pen that the boy's foolish letters were better than the man's adroit compliments and slippery gallantries that to win the woman he loves only a knave or a coward advances under cover with subterfuges and a retreat secured behind him but pen spoke not on this matter to mr <\s>
<s> warrington knowing pretty well that he was guilty and what his friend's verdict would be <\s>
<s> colonel altamont had not been for many weeks absent on his foreign tour sir francis clavering having retired meanwhile into the country pursuant to his agreement with major pendennis when the ills of fate began to fall rather suddenly and heavily upon the sole remaining partner of the little firm of shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> when strong at parting with altamont refused the loan proffered by the latter in the fulness of his purse and the generosity of his heart he made such a sacrifice to conscience and delicacy as caused him many an after twinge and pang he and felt it was not very many hours in his life he had experienced the feeling that in this juncture of his affairs he had been too delicate and too scrupulous <\s>
<s> why should a fellow in want refuse a kind offer kindly made <\s>
<s> why should a thirsty man decline a pitcher of water from a friendly hand because it was a little soiled <\s>
<s> strong's conscience smote him for refusing what the other had fairly come by and generously proffered and he thought ruefully now it was too late that altamont's cash would have been as well in his pocket as in that of the gambling house proprietor at baden or ems with whom his excellency would infallibly leave his derby winnings <\s>
<s> it was whispered among the tradesmen bill discounters and others who had commercial dealings with captain strong that he and the baronet had parted company and that the captain's paper was henceforth of no value <\s>
<s> the tradesmen who had put a wonderful confidence in him hitherto for who could resist strong's jolly face and frank and honest demeanour now began to pour in their bills with a cowardly mistrust and unanimity <\s>
<s> the knocks at the shepherd's inn chambers door were constant and tailors bootmakers pastrycooks who had furnished dinners in their own persons or by the boys their representatives held levees on strong's stairs <\s>
<s> to these were added one or two persons of a less clamorous but far more sly and dangerous sort the young clerks of lawyers namely who lurked about the inn or concerted with mr <\s>
<s> campion's young man in the chambers hard by having in their dismal pocketbooks copies of writs to be served on edward strong requiring him to appear on an early day next term before our sovereign lady the queen and answer to etc <\s>
<s> from this invasion of creditors poor strong who had not a guinea in his pocket had of course no refuge but that of the englishman's castle into which he retired shutting the outer and inner door upon the enemy and not quitting his stronghold until after nightfall <\s>
<s> against this outer barrier the foe used to come and knock and curse in vain whilst the chevalier peeped at them from behind the little curtain which he had put over the orifice of his letter box and had the dismal satisfaction of seeing the faces of furious clerk and fiery dun as they dashed up against the door and retreated from it <\s>
<s> but as they could not be always at his gate or sleep on his staircase the enemies of the chevalier sometimes left him free <\s>
<s> strong when so pressed by his commercial antagonists was not quite alone in his defence against them but had secured for himself an ally or two <\s>
<s> his friends were instructed to communicate with him by a system of private signals and they thus kept the garrison from starving by bringing in necessary supplies and kept up strong's heart and prevented him from surrendering by visiting him and cheering him in his retreat <\s>
<s> two of ned's most faithful allies were huxter and miss fanny bolton when hostile visitors were prowling about the inn fanny's little sisters were taught a particular cry or jodel which they innocently whooped in the court when fanny and huxter came up to visit strong they archly sang this same note at his door when that barrier was straightway opened the honest garrison came out smiling the provisions and the pot of porter were brought in and in the society of his faithful friends the beleaguered one passed a comfortable night <\s>
<s> there are some men who could not live under this excitement but strong was a brave man as we have said who had seen service and never lost heart in peril <\s>
<s> but besides allies our general had secured for himself under difficulties that still more necessary aid a retreat <\s>
<s> it has been mentioned in a former part of this history how messrs <\s>
<s> costigan and bows lived in the house next door to captain strong and that the window of one of their rooms was not very far off the kitchen window which was situated in the upper story of strong's chambers <\s>
<s> a leaden water pipe and gutter served for the two and strong looking out from his kitchen one day saw that he could spring with great ease up to the sill of his neighbour's window and clamber up the pipe which communicated from one to the other <\s>
<s> he had laughingly shown this refuge to his chum altamont and they had agreed that it would be as well not to mention the circumstance to captain costigan whose duns were numerous and who would be constantly flying down the pipe into their apartments if this way of escape were shown to him <\s>
<s> but now that the evil days were come strong made use of the passage and one afternoon burst in upon bows and costigan with his jolly face and explained that the enemy was in waiting on his staircase and that he had taken this means of giving them the slip <\s>
<s> marks's aides de camp were in waiting in the passage of no <\s>
<s> 3 strong walked down the steps of no <\s>
<s> 4 dined at the albion went to the play and returned home at midnight to the astonishment of mrs <\s>
<s> bolton and fanny who had not seen him quit his chambers and could not conceive how he could have passed the line of sentries <\s>
<s> strong bore this siege for some weeks with admirable spirit and resolution and as only such an old and brave soldier would for the pains and privations which he had to endure were enough to depress any man of ordinary courage and what vexed and riled him to use his own expression was the infernal indifference and cowardly ingratitude of clavering to whom he wrote letter after letter which the baronet never acknowledged by a single word or by the smallest remittance though a five pound note as strong said at that time would have been a fortune to him <\s>
<s> but better days were in store for the chevalier and in the midst of his despondency and perplexities there came to him a most welcome aid <\s>
<s> yes if it hadn't been for this good fellow here said strong for a good fellow you are altamont my boy and hang me if i don't stand by you as long as i live i think pendennis it would have been all up with ned strong <\s>
<s> i was the fifth week of my being kept a prisoner for i couldn't be always risking my neck across that water pipe and taking my walks abroad through poor old cos's window and my spirit was quite broken sir dammy quite beat and i was thinking of putting an end to myself and should have done it in another week when who should drop down from heaven but altamont <\s>
<s> heaven ain't exactly the place ned said altamont <\s>
<s> i came from baden baden said he and i'd had a deuced lucky month there that's all <\s>
<s> well sir he took up marks's bill and he paid the other fellows that were upon me like a man sir that he did said strong enthusiastically <\s>
<s> and i shall be very happy to stand a bottle of claret for this company and as many more as the company chooses said mr <\s>
<s> altamont with a blush <\s>
<s> waiter bring us a magnum of the right sort do you hear <\s>
<s> and we'll drink our healths all round sir and may every good fellow like strong find another good fellow to stand by him at a pinch <\s>
<s> that's my sentiment mr <\s>
<s> pendennis though i don't like your name <\s>
<s> strong pressed the colonel's foot under the table here and altamont rather excited filled up another bumper nodded to pen drank off his wine and said he was a gentleman and that was sufficient and they were all gentlemen <\s>
<s> the meeting between these all gentlemen took place at richmond whither pendennis had gone to dinner and where he found the chevalier and his friend at table in the coffee room <\s>
<s> both of the latter were exceedingly hilarious talkative and excited by wine and strong who was an admirable story teller told the story of his own siege and adventures and escapes with great liveliness and humour and described the talk of the sheriff's officers at his door the pretty little signals of fanny the grotesque exclamations of costigan when the chevalier burst in at his window and his final rescue by altamont in a most graphic manner and so as greatly to interest his hearers <\s>
<s> as for me it's nothing altamont said <\s>
<s> when a ship's paid off a chap spends his money you know <\s>
<s> and it's the fellers at the black and red at baden baden that did it <\s>
<s> i won a good bit of money there and intend to win a good bit more don't i strong <\s>
<s> i'm going to take him with me <\s>
<s> i've got a system <\s>
<s> i'll make his fortune i tell you <\s>
<s> i'll make your fortune if you like dammy everybody's fortune <\s>
<s> but what i'll do and no mistake boys i promise you <\s>
<s> i'll put in for that little fanny <\s>
<s> dammy sir what do you think she did <\s>
<s> she had two pound and i'm blest if she didn't go and lend it to ned strong <\s>
<s> let's drink her health <\s>
<s> with all my heart said arthur and pledged this toast with the greatest cordiality <\s>
<s> altamont then began with the greatest volubility at great length to describe his system <\s>
<s> he said that it was infallible if played with coolness that he had it from a chap at baden who had lost by it it was true but because he had not enough capital if he could have stood one more turn of the wheel he would have had all his money back that he and several more chaps were going to make a bank and try it and that he would put every shilling he was worth into it and had come back to the country for the express purpose of fetching away his money and captain strong that strong should play for him that he could trust strong and his temper much better than he could his own and much better than bloundell bloundell or the italian that stood in <\s>
<s> as he emptied his bottle the colonel described at full length all his plans and prospects to pen who was interested in listening to his story and the confessions of his daring and lawless good humour <\s>
<s> i met that queer fellow altamont the other day pen said to his uncle a day or two afterwards <\s>
<s> there's lord westport's son said the major <\s>
<s> no no the fellow who came tipsy into clavering's dining room one day when we were there said the nephew laughing he said he did not like the name of pendennis though he did me the honour to think that i was a good fellow <\s>
<s> i don't know any man of the name of altamont i give you my honour said the impenetrable major and as for your acquaintance i think the less you have to do with him the better arthur <\s>
<s> he is going to quit the country and make his fortune by a gambling system <\s>
<s> he and my amiable college acquaintance bloundell are partners and the colonel takes out strong with him as aide de camp <\s>
<s> what is it that binds the chevalier and clavering i wonder <\s>
<s> i should think mind you pen i should think but of course i have only the idea that there has been something in clavering's previous life which gives these fellows and some others a certain power over him and if there should be no such a secret which affair of ours my boy dammy i say it ought to be a lesson to a man to keep himself straight in life and not to give any man a chance over him <\s>
<s> why i think you have some means of persuasion over clavering uncle or why should he give me that seat in parlament <\s>
<s> clavering thinks he ain't fit for parliament the major answered <\s>
<s> no more he is <\s>
<s> what's to prevent him from putting you or anybody else into his place if he likes <\s>
<s> do you think that vernment or the opposition would make any bones about accepting the seat if he offered it to them <\s>
<s> why should you be more squeamish than the first men and the most honourable men and men of the highest birth and position in the country begad <\s>
<s> the major had an answer of this kind to most of pen's objections and pen accepted his uncle's replies not so much because he believed them but because he wished to believe them <\s>
<s> we do a thing which of us has not not because everybody does it but because we like it and our acquiescence alas <\s>
<s> proves not that everybody is right but that we and the rest of the world are poor creatures alike <\s>
<s> at his next visit to tunbridge mr <\s>
<s> pen did not forget to amuse miss blanche with the history which he had learned at richmond of the chevalier's imprisonment and of altamont's gallant rescue <\s>
<s> and after he had told his tale in his usual satirical way he mentioned with praise and emotion little fanny's generous behaviour to the chevalier and altamont's enthusiasm in her behalf <\s>
<s> miss blanche was somewhat jealous and a good deal piqued and curious about fanny <\s>
<s> among the many confidential little communications which arthur made to miss amory in the course of their delightful rural drives and their sweet evening walks it may be supposed that our hero would not forget a story so interesting to himself and so likely to be interesting to her as that of the passion and cure of the poor little ariadne of shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> his own part in that drama he described to do him justice with becoming modesty the moral which he wished to draw from the tale being one in accordance with his usual satirical mood viz that women get over their first loves quite as easily as men do for the fair blanche in their intimes conversations did not cease to twit mr <\s>
<s> pen about his notorious failure in his own virgin attachment to the fotheringay and number one being withdrawn transfer themselves to number two without much difficulty <\s>
<s> and poor little fanny was offered up in sacrifice as an instance to prove this theory <\s>
<s> what griefs she had endured and surmounted what bitter pangs of hopeless attachment she had gone through what time it had taken to heal those wounds of the tender little bleeding heart mr <\s>
<s> pen did not know or perhaps did not choose to know for he was at once modest and doubtful about his capabilities as a conqueror of hearts and averse to believe that he had executed any dangerous ravages on that particular one though his own instance and argument told against himself in this case for if as he said miss fanny was by this time in love with her surgical adorer who had neither good looks nor good manners nor wit nor anything but ardour and fidelity to recommend him must she not in her first sickness of the love complaint have had a serious attack and suffered keenly for a man who had certainly a number of the showy qualities which mr <\s>
<s> you wicked odious creature miss blanche said i believe that you are enraged with fanny for being so impudent as to forget you and that you are actually jealous of mr <\s>
<s> perhaps miss amory was right as the blush which came in spite of himself and tingled upon pendennis's cheek one of those blows with which a man's vanity is constantly slapping his face proved to pen that he was angry to think he had been superseded by such a rival <\s>
<s> by such a fellow as that <\s>
<s> without any conceivable good quality <\s>
<s> although this remark does not apply to such a smart fellow as you if nature had not made that provision for each sex in the credulity of the other which sees good qualities where none exist good looks in donkeys ears wit in their numskulls and music in their bray there would not have been near so much marrying and giving in marriage as now obtains and as is necessary for the due propagation and continuance of the noble race to which we belong <\s>
<s> jealous or not pen said and blanche i don't say no i should have liked fanny to have come to a better end than that <\s>
<s> i don't like histories that end in that cynical way and when we arrive at the conclusion of the story of a pretty girl's passion to find such a figure as huxter's at the last page of the tale <\s>
<s> is a life a compromise my lady fair and the end of the battle of love an ignoble surrender <\s>
<s> is the search for the cupid which my poor little psyche pursued in the darkness the god of her soul's longing the god of the blooming cheek and rainbow pinions to result in huxter smelling of tobacco and gallypots <\s>
<s> i wish though i don't see it in life that people could be like jenny and jessamy or my lord and lady clementina in the story books and fashionable novels and at once under the ceremony and as it were at the parson's benediction become perfectly handsome and good and happy ever after <\s>
<s> and don't you intend to be good and happy pray monsieur le misanthrope and are you very discontented with your lot and will your marriage be a compromise asked the author of mes larmes with a charming moue and is your psyche an odious vulgar wretch <\s>
<s> you wicked satirical creature i can't abide you <\s>
<s> you take the hearts of young things play with them and fling them away with scorn <\s>
<s> you ask for love and trample on it <\s>
<s> you you make me cry that you do arthur and and don't and i won't be consoled in that way and i think fanny was quite right in leaving such a heartless creature <\s>
<s> again i don't say no said pen looking very gloomily at blanche and not offering by any means to repeat the attempt at consolation which had elicited that sweet monosyllable don't from the young lady <\s>
<s> i don't think i have much of what people call heart but i don't profess it <\s>

<s> so when pen went to london he sent blanche a box of bonbons each sugar plum of which was wrapped up in ready made french verses of the most tender kind and besides despatched to her some poems of his own manufacture quite as artless and authentic and it was no wonder that he did not tell warrington what his conversations with miss amory had been of so delicate a sentiment were they and of a nature so necessarily private <\s>

<s> in which pen begins to doubt about his election whilst pen in his own county was thus carrying on his selfish plans and parliamentary schemes news came to him that lady rockminster had arrived at baymouth and had brought with her our friend laura <\s>

<s> his wish was to stand higher in her esteem perhaps than in that of any other person in the world <\s>

<s> he felt as if neither he nor blanche could bear laura's dazzling glance of calm scrutiny and as if he would not dare to disclose his worldly hopes and ambitions to that spotless judge <\s>
<s> at her arrival at baymouth he wrote a letter thither which contained a great number of fine phrases and protests of affection and a great deal of easy satire and raillery in the midst of all which mr <\s>
<s> pen could not help feeling that he was in panic and that he was acting like a rogue and hypocrite <\s>
<s> how was it that a simple country girl should be the object of fear and trembling to such an accomplished gentleman as mr <\s>

<s> under the charge of her kind though somewhat wayward and absolute patroness lady rockminster laura had seen somewhat of the world in the last year had gathered some accomplishments and profited by the lessons of society <\s>
<s> many a girl who had been accustomed to that too great tenderness in which laura's early life had been passed would have been unfitted for the changed existence which she now had to lead <\s>
<s> helen worshipped her two children and thought as home bred women will that all the world was made for them or to be considered after them <\s>
<s> she tended laura with a watchfulness of affection which never left her <\s>
<s> if she had a headache the widow was as alarmed as if there had never been an aching head before in the world <\s>
<s> she slept and woke read and moved under her mother's fond superintendence which was now withdrawn from her along with the tender creature whose anxious heart would beat no more <\s>
<s> and painful moments of grief and depression no doubt laura had when she stood in the great careless world alone <\s>
<s> nobody heeded her griefs or her solitude <\s>
<s> she was not quite the equal in social rank of the lady whose companion she was or of the friends and relatives of the imperious but kind old dowager <\s>
<s> some very likely bore her no goodwill some perhaps slighted her it might have been that servants were occasionally rude their mistress certainly was often <\s>
<s> laura not seldom found herself in family meetings the confidence and familiarity of which she felt were interrupted by her intrusion and her sensitiveness of course was wounded at the idea that she should give or feel this annoyance <\s>
<s> how many governesses are there in the world thought cheerful laura how many ladies whose necessities make them slaves and companions by profession <\s>
<s> what bad tempers and coarse unkindness have not these to encounter <\s>
<s> how infinitely better my lot is with these really kind and affectionate people than that of thousands of unprotected girls <\s>
<s> it was with this cordial spirit that our young lady adapted herself to her new position and went in advance of her fortune with a trustful smile <\s>

<s> anxious but a minute ago how she would take the news regarding his probable arrangements with blanche pen was hurt somehow that she received the intelligence so easily and took his happiness for granted <\s>

<s> they all marry for money now <\s>
<s> you are all selfish and cowards <\s>
<s> we ran away with each other and made foolish matches in my time <\s>

<s> laura my dear i've been telling your cousin that all the young men are selfish and that there is not a pennyworth of romance left among them <\s>
<s> he is as bad as the rest <\s>
<s> have you been asking arthur why he won't marry me <\s>
<s> said laura with a kindling smile coming back and taking her cousin's hand <\s>
<s> she had been away perhaps to hide some traces of emotion which she did not wish others to see he is going to marry somebody else and i intend to be very fond of her and to go and live with them provided he then does not ask every bachelor who comes to his house why he does not marry me <\s>
<s> the terrors of pen's conscience being thus appeased and his examination before laura over without any reproaches on the part of the latter pen began to find that his duty and inclination led him constantly to baymouth where lady rockminster informed him that a place was always reserved for him at her table <\s>
<s> and i recommend you to come often the old lady said for grandjean is an excellent cook and to be with laura and me will do your manners good <\s>

<s> you will dine here when you have no other engagements and if it rains you had better put up at the hotel <\s>
<s> as long as the good lady could order everybody round about her she was not hard to please and all the slaves and subjects of her little dowager court trembled before her but loved her <\s>
<s> she did not receive a very numerous or brilliant society <\s>

<s> arthur drank his wine by himself when lady rockminster retired to take her doze and to be played and sung to sleep by laura after dinner <\s>
<s> if my music can give her a nap said the good natured girl ought i not to be very glad that it can do so much good <\s>
<s> lady rockminster sleeps very little of nights and i used to read to her until i fell ill at paris since when she will not hear of my sitting up <\s>
<s> why did you not write to me when you were ill <\s>
<s> asked pen with a blush <\s>
<s> what good could you do me <\s>
<s> i had martha to nurse me and the doctor every day <\s>
<s> you are too busy to write to women or to think about them <\s>

<s> i wrote when i was well <\s>
<s> and pen looked at her and blushed again as he remembered that during all the time of her illness he had never written to her and had scarcely thought about her <\s>
<s> in consequence of his relationship pen was free to walk and ride with his cousin constantly and in the course of those walks and rides could appreciate the sweet frankness of her disposition and the truth simplicity and kindliness of her fair and spotless heart <\s>
<s> in their mother's lifetime she had never spoken so openly or so cordially as now <\s>
<s> the desire of poor helen to make an union between her two children had caused a reserve on laura's part towards pen for which under the altered circumstances of arthur's life there was now no necessity <\s>
<s> he was engaged to another woman and laura became his sister at once hiding or banishing from herself any doubts which she might have as to his choice striving to look cheerfully forward and hope for his prosperity promising herself to do all that affection might do to make her mother's darling happy <\s>
<s> their talk was often about the departed mother <\s>
<s> and it was from a thousand stories which laura told him that arthur was made aware how constant and absorbing that silent maternal devotion had been which had accompanied him present and absent through life and had only ended with the fond widow's last breath <\s>
<s> one day the people in clavering saw a lad in charge of a couple of horses at the churchyard gate and it was told over the place that pen and laura had visited helen's grave together <\s>
<s> since arthur had come down into the country he had been there once or twice but the sight of the sacred stone had brought no consolation to him <\s>
<s> a guilty man doing a guilty deed a mere speculator content to lay down his faith and honour for a fortune and a worldly career and owning that his life was but a contemptible surrender what right had he in the holy place <\s>
<s> what booted it to him in the world he lived in that others were no better than himself <\s>
<s> arthur and laura rode by the gates of fairoaks and he shook hands with his tenant's children playing on the lawn and the terrace laura looked steadily at the cottage wall at the creeper on the porch and the magnolia growing up to her window <\s>
<s> pendennis rode by to day one of the boys told his mother with a lady and he stopped and talked to us and he asked for a bit of honeysuckle off the porch and gave it the lady <\s>
<s> i couldn't see if she was pretty she had her veil down <\s>
<s> she was riding one of cramp's horses out of baymouth <\s>
<s> as they rode over the downs between home and baymouth pen did not speak much though they rode very close together <\s>
<s> he was thinking what a mockery life was and how men refuse happiness when they may have it or having it kick it down or barter it with their eyes open for a little worthless money or beggarly honour <\s>
<s> and then the thought came what does it matter for the little space <\s>
<s> the lives of the best and purest of us are consumed in a vain desire and end in a disappointment as the dear soul's who sleeps in her grave yonder <\s>
<s> she had her selfish ambition as much as caesar had and died baulked of her life's longing <\s>
<s> the stone covers over our hopes and our memories <\s>
<s> our place knows us not <\s>
<s> other people's children are playing on the grass he broke out in a hard voice where you and i used to play laura <\s>
<s> and you see how the magnolia we planted has grown up since our time <\s>
<s> i have been round to one or two of the cottages where my mother used to visit <\s>
<s> it is scarcely more than a year that she is gone and the people whom she used to benefit care no more for her death than for queen anne's <\s>
<s> we are all selfish the world is selfish there are but a few exceptions like you my dear to shine like good deeds in a naughty world and make the blackness more dismal <\s>
<s> i wish you would not speak in that way arthur said laura looking down and bending her head to the honeysuckle on her breast <\s>
<s> when you told the little boy to give me this you were not selfish <\s>
<s> a pretty sacrifice i made to get it for you <\s>
<s> but your heart was kind and full of love when you did so <\s>
<s> one cannot ask for more than love and kindness and if you think humbly of yourself arthur the love and kindness are diminished are they <\s>
<s> i often thought our dearest mother spoiled you at home by worshipping you and that if you are i hate the word what you say her too great fondness helped to make you so <\s>
<s> and as for the world when men go out into it i suppose they cannot be otherwise than selfish <\s>
<s> you have to fight for yourself and to get on for yourself and to make a name for yourself <\s>
<s> mamma and your uncle both encouraged you in this ambition <\s>
<s> if it is a vain thing why pursue it <\s>
<s> i suppose such a clever man as you intend to do a great deal of good to the country by going into parliament or you would not wish to be there <\s>
<s> what are you going to do when you are in the house of commons <\s>
<s> women don't understand about politics my dear pen said sneering at himself as he spoke <\s>
<s> but why don't you make us understand <\s>
<s> i could never tell about mr <\s>
<s> pynsent why he should like to be there so much <\s>
<s> he is not a clever man he certainly is not a genius pynsent said pen <\s>
<s> lady diana says that he attends committees all day that then again he is at the house all night that he always votes as he is told that he never speaks that he will never get on beyond a subordinate place and as his grandmother tells him he is choked with red tape <\s>
<s> are you going to follow the same career arthur <\s>
<s> what is there in it so brilliant that you should be so eager for it <\s>
<s> i would rather that you should stop at home and write books good books kind books with gentle kind thoughts such as you have dear arthur and such as might do people good to read <\s>
<s> and if you do not win fame what then <\s>
<s> you own it is vanity and you can live very happily without it <\s>
<s> i must not pretend to advise but i take you at your own word about the world and as you own it is wicked and that it tires you ask you why you don't leave it <\s>
<s> and what would you have me do <\s>
<s> i would have you bring your wife to fairoaks to live there and study and do good round about you <\s>
<s> i would like to see your own children playing on the lawn arthur and that we might pray in our mother's church again once more dear brother <\s>
<s> if the world is a temptation are we not told to pray that we may not be led into it <\s>
<s> do you think blanche would make a good wife for a petty country gentleman <\s>
<s> do you think i should become the character very well laura <\s>
<s> remember temptation walks about the hedgerows as well as the city streets and idleness is the greatest tempter of all <\s>
<s> said laura as a blush mounted up to her cheek and of which pen saw the fervour though laura's veil fell over her face to hide it <\s>
<s> pen rode on by laura's side silently for a while <\s>
<s> george's name so mentioned brought back the past to him and the thoughts which he had once had regarding george and laura <\s>
<s> why should the recurrence of the thought agitate him now that he knew the union was impossible <\s>
<s> why should he be curious to know if during the months of their intimacy laura had felt a regard for warrington <\s>
<s> from that day until the present time george had never alluded to his story and arthur remembered now that since then george had scarcely ever mentioned laura's name <\s>
<s> at last he cane close to her <\s>
<s> tell me something laura he said <\s>
<s> she put back her veil and looked at him <\s>
<s> what is it arthur <\s>
<s> she asked though from the tremor of her voice she guessed very well <\s>
<s> tell me but for george's misfortune i never knew him speak of it before or since that day would you would you have given him what you refused me <\s>
<s> yes pen she said bursting into tears <\s>
<s> he deserved you better than i did poor arthur groaned forth with an indescribable pang at his heart <\s>
<s> i am but a selfish wretch and george is better nobler truer than i am <\s>
<s> yes pen said laura reaching out her hand to her cousin and he put his arm round her and for a moment she sobbed on his shoulder <\s>
<s> the gentle girl had had her secret and told it <\s>
<s> in the widow's last journey from fairoaks when hastening with her mother to arthur's sick bed laura had made a different confession and it was only when warrington told his own story and described the hopeless condition of his life that she discovered how much her feelings had changed and with what tender sympathy with what great respect delight and admiration she had grown to regard her cousin's friend <\s>
<s> until she knew that some plans she might have dreamed of were impossible and that warrington reading in her heart perhaps had told his melancholy story to warn her she had not asked herself whether it was possible that her affections could change and had been shocked and seared by the discovery of the truth <\s>
<s> how should she have told it to helen and confessed her shame <\s>
<s> poor laura felt guilty before her friend with the secret which she dared not confide to her felt as if she had been ungrateful for helen's love and regard felt as if she had been wickedly faithless to pen in withdrawing that love from him which he did not even care to accept humbled even and repentant before warrington lest she should have encouraged him by undue sympathy or shown the preference which she began to feel <\s>
<s> the catastrophe which broke up laura's home and the grief and anguish which she felt for her mother's death gave her little leisure for thoughts more selfish and by the time she rallied from that grief the minor one was also almost cured <\s>
<s> it was but for a moment that she had indulged a hope about warrington <\s>
<s> her admiration and respect for him remained as strong as ever <\s>
<s> but the tender feeling with which she knew she had regarded him was schooled into such calmness that it may be said to have been dead and passed away <\s>
<s> the pang which it left behind was one of humility and remorse <\s>
<s> oh how wicked and proud i was about arthur she thought how self confident and unforgiving <\s>
<s> i never forgave from my heart this poor girl who was fond of him or him for encouraging her love and i have been more guilty than she poor little artless creature <\s>
<s> i professing to love one man could listen to another only too eagerly and would not pardon the change of feelings in arthur whilst i myself was changing and unfaithful and so humiliating herself and acknowledging her weakness the poor girl sought for strength and refuge in the manner in which she had been accustomed to look for them <\s>
<s> she had done no wrong but there are some folks who suffer for a fault ever so trifling as much as others whose stout consciences can walk under crimes of almost any weight and poor laura chose to fancy that she had acted in this delicate juncture of her life as a very great criminal <\s>
<s> she determined that she had done pen a great injury by withdrawing that love which privately in her mother's hearing she had bestowed upon him that she had been ungrateful to her dead benefactress by ever allowing herself to think of another or of violating her promise and that considering her own enormous crimes she ought to be very gentle in judging those of others whose temptations were much greater very likely and whose motives she could not understand <\s>
<s> a year back laura would have been indignant at the idea that arthur should marry blanche and her high spirit would have risen as she thought that from worldly motives he should stoop to one so unworthy <\s>
<s> now when the news was brought to her of such a chance the intelligence was given to her by old lady rockminster whose speeches were as direct and rapid as a slap on the face the humbled girl winced a little at the blow but bore it meekly and with a desperate acquiescence <\s>
<s> he has a right to marry he knows a great deal more of the world than i do she argued with herself <\s>
<s> blanche may not be so light minded as she seemed and who am i to be her judge <\s>
<s> i daresay it is very good that arthur should go into parliament and distinguish himself and my duty is to do everything that lies in my power to aid him and blanche and to make his home happy <\s>
<s> i daresay i shall live with them <\s>
<s> if i am godmother to one of their children i will leave her my three thousand pounds <\s>
<s> and forthwith she began to think what she could give blanche out of her small treasures and how best to conciliate her affection <\s>
<s> she wrote her forthwith a kind letter in which of course no mention was made of the plans in contemplation but in which laura recalled old times and spoke her goodwill and in reply to this she received an eager answer from blanche in which not a word about marriage was said to be sure but mr <\s>
<s> pendennis was mentioned two or three times in the letter and they were to be henceforth dearest laura and dearest blanche and loving sisters and so forth <\s>
<s> when pen and laura reached home after laura's confession pen's noble acknowledgment of his own inferiority and generous expression of love for warrington causing the girl's heart to throb and rendering doubly keen those tears which she sobbed on his shoulder a little slim letter was awaiting miss bell in the hall which she trembled rather guiltily as she unsealed and which pen blushed as he recognised for he saw instantly that it was from blanche <\s>
<s> laura opened it hastily and cast her eyes quickly over it as pen kept his fixed on her blushing <\s>
<s> she dates from london laura said <\s>
<s> she has been with old bonner lady clavering's maid <\s>
<s> bonner is going to marry lightfoot the butler <\s>
<s> where do you think blanche has been <\s>
<s> she cried out eagerly <\s>
<s> to paris to scotland to the casino <\s>
<s> to shepherd's inn to see fanny but fanny wasn't there and blanche is going to leave a present for her <\s>
<s> isn't it kind of her and thoughtful <\s>
<s> and she handed the letter to pen who read i saw madame mere who was scrubbing the room and looked at me with very scrubby looks but la belle fanny was not au logis and as i heard that she was in captain strong's apartments bonner and i mounted au troisieme to see this famous beauty <\s>

<s> one is a parlour frequented by the public at large to another room gentlemen in livery resort and the third apartment on the door of which private is painted is that hired by the club of the confidentials of which messrs morgan and lightfoot were members <\s>
<s> the noiseless morgan had listened to the conversation between strong and major pendennis at the latter's own lodgings and had carried away from it matter for much private speculation and a desire of knowledge had led him to follow his master when the major came to the wheel of fortune and to take his place quietly in the confidential room whilst pendennis and clavering had their discourse in the parlour <\s>
<s> there was a particular corner in the confidential room from which you could hear almost all that passed in the next apartment and as the conversation between the two gentlemen there was rather angry and carried on in a high key morgan had the benefit of overhearing almost the whole of it and what he heard strengthened the conclusions which his mind had previously formed <\s>
<s> he knew altamont at once did he when he saw him in sydney <\s>
<s> clavering ain't no more married to my lady than i am <\s>

<s> no wonder he's anxious to make the match between blanche and harthur why she'll have a hundred thousand if she's a penny and bring her man a seat in parlyment into the bargain <\s>
<s> nobody saw but a physiognomist would have liked to behold the expression of mr <\s>
<s> morgan's countenance when this astounding intelligence was made clear to him <\s>
<s> but for my hage and the confounded preudices of society he said surveying himself in the glass dammy james morgan you might marry her yourself <\s>
<s> but if he could not marry miss blanche and her fortune morgan thought he could mend his own by the possession of this information and that it might be productive of benefit to him from very many sources <\s>
<s> of all the persons whom the secret affected the greater number would not like to have it known <\s>
<s> for instance sir francis clavering whose fortune it involved would wish to keep it quiet colonel altamont whose neck it implicated would naturally be desirous to hush it and that young hupstart beast mr <\s>
<s> harthur who was for getting into parlyment on the strenth of it and was as proud as if he was a duke with half a millium a year such we grieve to say was morgan's opinion of his employer's nephew would pay anythink sooner than let the world know that he was married to a convick's daughter and had got his seat in parlyment by trafficking with this secret <\s>
<s> as for lady c morgan thought if she's tired of clavering and wants to get rid of him she'll pay if she's frightened about her son and fond of the little beggar she'll pay all the same and miss blanche will certainly come down handsome to the man who will put her into her rights which she was unjustly defrauded of them and no mistake <\s>

<s> one of the persons whom the story chiefly concerned colonel altamont was absent from london when morgan was thus made acquainted with his history <\s>
<s> the valet knew of sir francis clavering's shepherd's inn haunt and walked thither an hour or two after the baronet and pendennis had had their conversation together <\s>

<s> the fact of his absence was exceedingly vexatious to mr <\s>
<s> he'll drop all that money at the gambling shops on the rhind thought morgan and i might have had a good bit of it <\s>
<s> it's confounded annoying to think he's gone and couldn't have waited a few days longer <\s>
<s> hope triumphant or deferred ambition or disappointment victory or patient ambush morgan bore all alike with similar equable countenance <\s>
<s> until the proper day came the major's boots were varnished and his hair was curled his early cup of tea was brought to his bedside his oaths rebukes and senile satire borne with silent obsequious fidelity <\s>
<s> who would think to see him waiting upon his master packing and shouldering his trunks and occasionally assisting at table at the country houses where he might be staying that morgan was richer than his employer and knew his secrets and other people's <\s>

<s> i was charging him with taking my property and desired to examine his trunks and his room <\s>
<s> the velvet cloak you ain't worn these three years nor the weskits and i thought i might take the shirts and i i take my hoath i intended to put back the hopera glass roared morgan writhing with rage and terror <\s>
<s> the man acknowledges that he is a thief the major said calmly <\s>
<s> he has been in my service for years and i have treated him with every kindness and confidence <\s>
<s> we will go upstairs and examine his trunks <\s>
<s> in those trunks mr <\s>
<s> morgan had things which he would fain keep from public eyes <\s>
<s> morgan the bill discounter gave goods as well as money to his customers <\s>
<s> he provided young spendthrifts with snuff boxes and pins and jewels and pictures and cigars and of a very doubtful quality those cigars and jewels and pictures were <\s>
<s> their display at a police office the discovery of his occult profession and the exposure of the major's property which he had appropriated indeed rather than stolen would not have added to the reputation of mr <\s>
<s> he looked a piteous image of terror and discomfiture <\s>
<s> he'll smash me will he <\s>
<s> i'll crush him now and finish with him <\s>
<s> he looked at poor mrs <\s>
<s> brixham's scared face and he thought for a moment to himself that the man brought to bay and in prison might make disclosures which had best be kept secret and that it was best not to deal too fiercely with a desperate man <\s>
<s> stop he said policeman <\s>
<s> i'll speak with this man by himself <\s>
<s> do you give mr <\s>
<s> i have brought no charge as yet the major said with a significant look at his man <\s>
<s> thank you sir whispered morgan very low <\s>
<s> go outside the door and wait there policeman if you please now morgan you have played one game with me and you have not had the best of it my good man <\s>
<s> no begad you've not had the best of it though you had the best hand and you've got to pay too now you scoundrel <\s>

<s> i won't give it up said morgan if i do i'm policeman <\s>
<s> you shall have the bill said morgan <\s>
<s> you're not going to take money of me and you a gentleman <\s>
<s> i shall want you directly said the major to x who here entered and who again withdrew <\s>
<s> no my good sir the old gentleman continued i have not any desire to have further pecuniary transactions with you but we will draw out a little paper which you will have the kindness to sign <\s>
<s> no stop you shall write it you have improved immensely in writing of late and have now a very good hand <\s>
<s> you shall sit down and write if you please there at that table so let me see we may as well have the date <\s>

<s> james's october 21 18 and mr <\s>
<s> morgan wrote as he was instructed and as the pitiless old major continued i james morgan having come in extreme poverty into the service of arthur pendennis esquire of bury street st <\s>
<s> james's a major in her majesty's service acknowledge that i received liberal wages and board wages from my employer during fifteen years you can't object to that i am sure said the major <\s>
<s> during fifteen years wrote morgan <\s>
<s> in which time by my own care and prudence the dictator resumed i have managed to amass sufficient money to purchase the house in which my master resides and besides to effect other savings <\s>
<s> amongst other persons from whom i have had money i may mention my present tenant mrs <\s>
<s> brixham who in consideration of sixty pounds advanced by me five years since has paid back to me the sum of two hundred and fifty pounds sterling besides giving me a note of hand for one hundred and twenty pounds which i restore to her at the desire of my late master major arthur pendennis and therewith free her furniture of which i had a bill of sale have you written <\s>
<s> i think if this pistol was loaded i'd blow your brains out said morgan <\s>
<s> you have too great a respect for your valuable life my good man the major answered <\s>
<s> let us go on and begin a new sentence <\s>
<s> and having in return for my master's kindness stolen his property from him which i acknowledge to be now upstairs in my trunks and having uttered falsehoods regarding his and other honourable families i do hereby in consideration of his clemency to me express my regret for uttering these falsehoods and for stealing his property and declare that i am not worthy of belief and that i hope' yes begad 'that i hope to amend for the future <\s>
<s> signed james morgan i'm d  d if i sign it said morgan <\s>
<s> my good man it will happen to you whether you sign or no begad said the old fellow chuckling at his own wit there i shall not use this you understand unless unless i am compelled to do so <\s>
<s> brixham and our friend the policeman will witness it i dare say without reading it and i will give the old lady back her note of hand and say which you will confirm that she and you are quits <\s>
<s> i see there is frosch come back with the cab for my trunks i shall go to an hotel you may come in now policeman mr <\s>
<s> morgan and i have arranged our little dispute <\s>
<s> brixham will sign this paper and you policeman will do so i shall be very much obliged to you both <\s>
<s> brixham you and your worthy landlord mr <\s>
<s> i wish you joy of him <\s>
<s> let frosch come and pack the rest of the things <\s>
<s> frosch aided by the slavey under the calm superintendence of mr <\s>
<s> morgan carried major pendennis's boxes to the cabs in waiting and mrs <\s>
<s> brixham when her persecutor was not by came and asked a heaven's blessing upon the major her preserver and the best and quietest and kindest of lodgers <\s>
<s> and having given her a finger to shake which the humble lady received with a curtsey and over which she was ready to make a speech full of tears the major cut short that valedictory oration and walked out of the house to the hotel in jermyn street which was not many steps from morgan's door <\s>
<s> that individual looking forth from the parlour window discharged anything but blessings at his parting guest but the stout old boy could afford not to be frightened at mr <\s>
<s> morgan and flung him a look of great contempt and humour as he strutted away with his cane <\s>
<s> major pendennis had not quitted his house of bury street many hours and mr <\s>
<s> morgan was enjoying his otium in a dignified manner surveying the evening fog and smoking a cigar on the door steps when arthur pendennis esq the hero of this history made his appearance at the well known door <\s>
<s> my uncle out i suppose morgan <\s>
<s> he said to the functionary knowing full well that to smoke was treason in the presence of the major <\s>
<s> major pendennis is hout sir said morgan with gravity bowing but not touching the elegant cap which he wore <\s>
<s> major pendennis have left this ouse to day sir and i have no longer the honour of being in his service sir <\s>
<s> indeed and where is he <\s>
<s> i believe he ave taken tempory lodgings at cox's otel in jummin street said mr <\s>
<s> morgan and added after a pause are you in town for some time pray sir <\s>
<s> are you in chambers <\s>
<s> i should like to have the honour of waiting on you there and would be thankful if you would favour me with a quarter of an hour <\s>
<s> do you want my uncle to take you back <\s>
<s> asked arthur insolent and good natured <\s>
<s> i want no such thing i'd see him the man glared at him for a minute but he stopped <\s>
<s> no sir thank you he said in a softer voice it's only with you that i wish to speak on some business which concerns you and perhaps you would favour me by walking into my house <\s>
<s> if it is but for a minute or two i will listen to you morgan said arthur and thought to himself i suppose the fellow wants me to patronise him and he entered the house <\s>
<s> a card was already in the front windows proclaiming that apartments were to be let and having introduced mr <\s>
<s> pendennis into the dining room and offered him a chair mr <\s>
<s> morgan took one himself and proceeded to convey some information to him of which the reader has already had cognisance <\s>
<s> in which pendennis counts his eggs our friend had arrived in london on that day only though but for a brief visit and having left some fellow travellers at an hotel to which he had convoyed them from the west he hastened to the chambers in lamb court which were basking in as much sun as chose to visit that dreary but not altogether comfortless building <\s>
<s> freedom stands in lieu of sunshine in chambers and templars grumble but take their ease in their inn <\s>
<s> pen's domestic announced to him that warrington was in chambers too and of course arthur ran up to his friend's room straightway and found it as of old perfumed with the pipe and george once more at work with his newspapers and reviews <\s>
<s> the pair greeted each other with the rough cordiality which young englishmen use one to another and which carries a great deal of warmth and kindness under its rude exterior <\s>
<s> warrington smiled and took his pipe out of his mouth and said well young one <\s>
<s> pen advanced and held out his hand and said how are you old boy <\s>
<s> and so this greeting passed between two friends who had not seen each other for months <\s>
<s> alphonse and frederic would have rushed into each other's arms and shrieked ce bon coeur <\s>
<s> over each other's shoulders <\s>
<s> max and wilhelm would have bestowed half a dozen kisses scented with havannah upon each other's mustachios <\s>
<s> how are you old boy <\s>
<s> is what two britons say after saving each other's lives possibly the day before <\s>
<s> to morrow they will leave off shaking hands and only wag their heads at one another as they come to breakfast <\s>
<s> each has for the other the very warmest confidence and regard each would share his purse with the other and hearing him attacked would break out in the loudest and most enthusiastic praise of his friend but they part with a mere good bye they meet with a mere how d'you do <\s>
<s> and they don't write to each other in the interval <\s>
<s> curious modesty strange stoical decorum of english friendship <\s>
<s> yes we are not demonstrative like those confounded foreigners says hardman who not only shows no friendship but never felt any all his life long <\s>
<s> couldn't find a bit of tobacco fit to smoke till we came to strasburg where i got some caporal <\s>
<s> the man's mind is full very likely of the great sights which he has seen of the great emotions with which the vast works of nature have inspired it <\s>
<s> but his enthusiasm is too coy to show itself even to his closest friend and he veils it with a cloud of tobacco <\s>
<s> he will speak more fully of confidential evenings however and write ardently and frankly about that which he is shy of saying <\s>
<s> the thoughts and experience of his travel will come forth in his writings as the learning which he never displays in talk enriches his style with pregnant allusion and brilliant illustration colours his generous eloquence and points his wit <\s>
<s> the elder gives a rapid account of the places which he has visited in his tour <\s>
<s> he has seen switzerland north italy and the tyrol he has come home by vienna and dresden and the rhine <\s>
<s> he speaks about these places in a shy sulky voice as if he had rather not mention them at all and as if the sight of them had rendered him very unhappy <\s>
<s> the outline of the elder man's tour thus gloomily sketched out the young one begins to speak <\s>
<s> he has been in the country very much bored canvassing uncommonly slow he is here for a day or two and going on to to the neighbourhood of tunbridge wells to some friends that will be uncommonly slow too <\s>
<s> how hard it is to make an englishman acknowledge that he is happy <\s>
<s> and the seat in parliament pen <\s>
<s> have you made it all right <\s>
<s> all right as soon as parliament meets and a new writ can be issued clavering retires and i step into his shoes says pen <\s>
<s> and under which king does bezonian speak or die <\s>
<s> do we come out as liberal conservative or as government man or on our own hook <\s>
<s> there are no politics now every man's politics at least are pretty much the same <\s>
<s> i have not got acres enough to make me a protectionist nor could i be one i think if i had all the land in the county <\s>
<s> i shall go pretty much with government and in advance of them upon some social questions which i have been getting up during the vacation don't grin you old cynic i have been getting up the blue books and intend to come out rather strong on the sanitary and colonisation questions <\s>
<s> we reserve to ourselves the liberty of voting against government though we are generally friendly <\s>
<s> we are however friends of the people avant tout <\s>
<s> we give lectures at the clavering institute and shake bands with the intelligent mechanics <\s>
<s> we think the franchise ought to be very considerably enlarged at the same time we are free to accept office some day when the house has listened to a few crack speeches from us and the administration perceives our merit <\s>
<s> i am not moses said pen with as usual somewhat of melancholy in his voice <\s>
<s> i have no laws from heaven to bring down to the people from the mountain <\s>
<s> i don't belong to the mountain at all or set up to be a leader and reformer of mankind <\s>
<s> my faith is not strong enough for that nor my vanity nor my hypocrisy great enough <\s>
<s> i will tell no lies george that i promise you and do no more than coincide in those which are necessary and pass current and can't be got in without recalling the whole circulation <\s>
<s> give a man at least the advantage of his sceptical turn <\s>
<s> if i find a good thing to say in the house i will say it a good measure i will support it a fair place i will take it and be glad of my luck <\s>
<s> but i would no more flatter a great man than a mob and now you know as much about my politics as i do <\s>
<s> what call have i to be a whig <\s>
<s> whiggism is not a divine institution <\s>
<s> why not vote with the liberal conservatives <\s>
<s> they have done for the nation what the whigs would never have done without them <\s>
<s> who converted both the radicals and the country outside <\s>
<s> i think the morning post is often right and punch is often wrong <\s>
<s> i don't profess a call but take advantage of a chance <\s>
<s> the next thing at your heart after ambition is love i suppose <\s>
<s> how have our young loves prospered <\s>
<s> are we going to change our condition and give up our chambers <\s>
<s> are you going to divorce me arthur and take unto yourself a wife <\s>
<s> she is very good natured and lively <\s>
<s> she sings and she don't mind smoking <\s>
<s> she'll have a fair fortune i don't know how much but my uncle augurs everything from the begum's generosity and says that she will come down very handsomely <\s>
<s> and i think blanche is dev'lish fond of me said arthur with a sigh <\s>
<s> that means that we accept her caresses and her money <\s>
<s> haven't we said before that life was a transaction <\s>
<s> i don't pretend to break my heart about her <\s>
<s> i have told her pretty fairly what my feelings are and and have engaged myself to her <\s>
<s> and since i saw her last and for the last two months especially whilst i have been in the country i think she has been growing fonder and fonder of me and her letters to me and especially to laura seem to show it <\s>
<s> mine have been simple enough no raptures nor vows you understand but looking upon the thing as an affaire faite and not desirous to hasten or defer the completion <\s>
<s> laura george said pen looking his friend hard in the face by heaven laura is the best and noblest and dearest girl the sun ever shone upon <\s>
<s> his own voice fell as he spoke it seemed as if he could hardly utter the words he stretched out his hand to his comrade who took it and nodded his head <\s>
<s> have you only found out that now young un <\s>
<s> warrington said after a pause <\s>
<s> who has not learned things too late george <\s>
<s> cried arthur in his impetuous way gathering words and emotion as he went on <\s>
<s> whose life is not a disappointment <\s>
<s> who carries his heart entire to the grave without a mutilation <\s>
<s> i never knew anybody who was happy quite or who has not had to ransom himself out of the hands of fate with the payment of some dearest treasure or other <\s>
<s> lucky if we are left alone afterwards when we have paid our fine and if the tyrant visits us no more <\s>
<s> suppose i have found out that i have lost the greatest prize in the world now that it can't be mine that for years i had an angel under my tent and let her go am i the only one ah dear old boy am i the only one <\s>
<s> and do you think my lot is easier to bear because i own that i deserve it <\s>
<s> she's gone from us <\s>
<s> god's blessing be with her <\s>
<s> she might have stayed and i lost her it's like undine isn't it george <\s>
<s> she was in this room once said george <\s>
<s> he saw her there he heard the sweet low voice he saw the sweet smile and eyes shining so kindly the face remembered so fondly thought of in what night watches blest and loved always gone now <\s>
<s> a glass that had held a nosegay a bible with helen's handwriting were all that were left him of that brief flower of his life <\s>
<s> say it is a dream say it passes better the recollection of a dream than an aimless waking from a blank stupor <\s>
<s> the two friends sate in silence a while each occupied with his own thoughts and aware of the other's <\s>
<s> pen broke it presently by saying that he must go and seek for his uncle and report progress to the old gentleman <\s>
<s> the major had written in a very bad humour the major was getting old <\s>
<s> i should like to see you in parliament and snugly settled with a comfortable house and an heir to the name before i make my bow <\s>
<s> show me these the major wrote and then let old arthur pendennis make room for the younger fellows he has walked the pall mall pave long enough <\s>
<s> there is a kindness about the old heathen said warrington <\s>
<s> he cares for somebody besides himself at least for some other part of himself besides that which is buttoned into his own coat for you and your race <\s>
<s> he would like to see the progeny of the pendennises multiplying and increasing and hopes that they may inherit the land <\s>
<s> the old patriarch blesses you from the club window of bays's and is carried off and buried under the flags of st <\s>
<s> james's church in sight of piccadilly and the cabstand and the carriages going to the levee <\s>
<s> it is an edifying ending <\s>
<s> the new blood i bring into the family mused pen is rather tainted <\s>
<s> if i had chosen i think my father in law amory would not have been the progenitor i should have desired for my race nor my grandfather in law snell nor our oriental ancestors <\s>
<s> by the way who was amory <\s>
<s> amory was lieutenant of an indiaman <\s>
<s> blanche wrote some verses about him about the storm the mountain wave the seaman's grave the gallant father and that sort of thing <\s>
<s> amory was drowned commanding a country ship between calcutta and sydney amory and the begum weren't happy together <\s>
<s> she has been unlucky in her selection of husbands the good old lady for between ourselves a more despicable creature than sir francis clavering of clavering park baronet never never legislated for his country broke in warrington at which pen blushed rather <\s>
<s> by the way at baden said warrington i found our friend the chevalier strong in great state and wearing his orders <\s>
<s> he told me that he had quarrelled with clavering of whom he seemed to have almost as bad an opinion as you have and in fact i think though i will not be certain confided to me his opinion that clavering was an utter scoundrel <\s>
<s> that fellow bloundell who taught you card playing at oxbridge was with strong and time i think has brought out his valuable qualities and rendered him a more accomplished rascal than he was during your undergraduateship <\s>
<s> but the king of the place was the famous colonel altamont who was carrying all before him giving flies to the whole society and breaking the bank it was said <\s>
<s> my uncle knows something about that fellow clavering knows something about him <\s>
<s> there's something louche regarding him <\s>
<s> i must go to bury street like a dutiful nephew <\s>
<s> and taking his hat pen prepared to go <\s>
<s> i will walk too said warrington <\s>
<s> and they descended the stairs stopping however at pen's chambers which as the reader has been informed were now on the lower story <\s>
<s> here pen began sprinkling himself with eau de cologne and carefully scenting his hair and whiskers with that odoriferous water <\s>
<s> what is the matter <\s>
<s> you've not been smoking <\s>
<s> is it my pipe that has poisoned you <\s>
<s> i am going to call upon some women said pen <\s>
<s> i'm i'm going to dine with em <\s>
<s> they are passing through town and are at an hotel in jermyn street <\s>
<s> warrington looked with good natured interest at the young fellow dandifying himself up to a pitch of completeness and appearing at length in a gorgeous shirt front and neckcloth fresh gloves and glistening boots <\s>
<s> george had a pair of thick high lows and his old shirt was torn about the breast and ragged at the collar where his blue beard had worn it <\s>
<s> well young un said he simply i like you to be a buck somehow <\s>
<s> when i walk about with you it is as if i had a rose in my button hole <\s>
<s> and you are still affable <\s>
<s> i don't think there is any young fellow in the temple turns out like you and i don't believe you were ever ashamed of walking with me yet <\s>
<s> don't laugh at me george <\s>
<s> i say pen continued the other sadly if you write if you write to laura i wish you would say god bless her from me <\s>
<s> pen blushed and then looked at warrington and then and then burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughing <\s>
<s> i'm going to dine with her he said <\s>
<s> i brought her and lady rockminster up from the country to day made two days of it slept last night at bath i say george come and dine too <\s>
<s> i may ask any one i please and the old lady is constantly talking about you <\s>
<s> george had an article to write <\s>
<s> george hesitated and oh strange to say <\s>
<s> at last he agreed to go <\s>
<s> it was agreed that they should go and call upon the ladies and they marched away in high spirits to the hotel in jermyn street <\s>
<s> once more the dear face shone upon him once more the sweet voice spoke to him and the tender hand pressed a welcome <\s>
<s> there still wanted half an hour to dinner <\s>
<s> you will go and see your uncle now mr <\s>
<s> pendennis old lady rockminster said <\s>
<s> you will not bring him to dinner no his old stories are intolerable and i want to talk to mr <\s>
<s> warrington i daresay he will amuse us <\s>
<s> i think we have heard all your stories <\s>
<s> we have been together for two whole days and i think we are getting tired of each other <\s>
<s> so obeying her ladyship's orders arthur went downstairs and walked to his uncle's lodgings <\s>
<s> fiat justitia the dinner was served when arthur returned and lady rockminster began to scold him for arriving late <\s>
<s> but laura looking at her cousin saw that his face was so pale and scared that she interrupted her imperious patroness and asked with tender alarm what had happened <\s>
<s> arthur drank a large bumper of sherry <\s>
<s> i have heard the most extraordinary news i will tell you afterwards he said looking at the servants <\s>
<s> he was very nervous and agitated during the dinner <\s>
<s> don't tramp and beat so with your feet under the table lady rockminster said <\s>
<s> you have trodden on fido and upset his saucer <\s>
<s> warrington keeps his boots quiet <\s>
<s> at the dessert it seemed as if the unlucky dinner would never be over lady rockminster said this dinner has been exceedingly stupid <\s>
<s> i suppose something has happened and that you want to speak to laura <\s>
<s> i will go and have my nap <\s>
<s> i am not sure that i shall have any tea no <\s>
<s> you must come again and when there is no business to talk about <\s>
<s> and the old lady tossing up her head walked away from the room with great dignity <\s>
<s> george and the others had risen with her and warrington was about to go away and was saying good night to laura who of course was looking much alarmed about her cousin when arthur said pray stay george <\s>
<s> you should hear my news too and give me your counsel in this case <\s>
<s> i hardly know how to act in it <\s>
<s> it's something about blanche arthur said laura her heart beating and her cheek blushing as she thought it had never blushed in her life <\s>
<s> yes and the most extraordinary story said pen <\s>
<s> when i left you to go to my uncle's lodgings i found his servant morgan who has been with him so long at the door and he said that he and his master had parted that morning that my uncle had quitted the house and had gone to an hotel this hotel <\s>
<s> i asked for him when i came in but he was gone out to dinner <\s>
<s> morgan then said that he had something of a most important nature to communicate to me and begged me to step into the house his house it is now <\s>
<s> it appears the scoundrel has saved a great deal of money whilst in my uncle's service and is now a capitalist and a millionaire for what i know <\s>
<s> well i went into the house and what do you think he told me <\s>
<s> this must be a secret between us all at least if we can keep it now that it is in possession of that villain <\s>
<s> blanche's father is not dead <\s>
<s> he has come to life again <\s>
<s> the marriage between clavering and the begum is no marriage <\s>
<s> and blanche i suppose is her grandfather's heir said warrington <\s>
<s> perhaps but the child of what a father <\s>
<s> amory is an escaped convict clavering knows it my uncle knows it and it was with this piece of information held over clavering in terrorem that the wretched old man got him to give up his borough to me <\s>
<s> blanche doesn't know it said laura nor poor lady clavering <\s>
<s> no said pen blanche does not even know the history of her father <\s>
<s> she knew that he and her mother had separated and had heard as a child from bonner her nurse that mr <\s>
<s> amory was drowned in new south wales <\s>
<s> he was there as a convict not as a ship's captain as the poor girl thought <\s>
<s> lady clavering has told me that they were not happy and that her husband was a bad character <\s>
<s> she would tell me all she said some day and i remember her saying to me with tears in her eyes that it was hard for a woman to be forced to own that she was glad to hear her husband was dead and that twice in her life she should have chosen so badly <\s>
<s> what is to be done now <\s>
<s> the man can't show and claim his wife death is probably over him if he discovers himself return to transportation certainly <\s>
<s> but the rascal has held the threat of discovery over clavering for some time past and has extorted money from him time after time <\s>
<s> it is our friend colonel altamont of course said warrington i see all now <\s>
<s> if the rascal comes back continued arthur morgan who knows his secret will use it over him and having it in his possession proposes to extort money from us all <\s>
<s> the d  d rascal supposed i was cognisant of it said pen white with anger asked me if i would give him an annuity to keep it quiet threatened me me as if i was trafficking with this wretched old begum's misfortune and would extort a seat in parliament out of that miserable clavering <\s>
<s> was my uncle mad to tamper in such a conspiracy <\s>
<s> fancy our mother's son laura trading on such a treason <\s>
<s> i can't fancy it dear arthur said laura seizing arthur's hand and kissing it <\s>
<s> broke out warrington's deep voice with a tremor he surveyed the two generous and loving young people with a pang of indescribable love and pain <\s>
<s> our boy can't meddle with such a wretched intrigue as that <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis can't marry a convict's daughter and sit in parliament as member for the hulks <\s>
<s> you must wash your hands of the whole affair pen <\s>
<s> you must break off <\s>
<s> you must give no explanations of why and wherefore but state that family reasons render a match impossible <\s>
<s> it is better that those poor women should fancy you false to your word than that they should know the truth <\s>
<s> besides you can get from that dog clavering i can fetch that for you easily enough an acknowledgment that the reasons which you have given to him as the head of the family are amply sufficient for breaking off the union <\s>
<s> don't you think with me laura <\s>
<s> he scarcely dared to look her in the face as he spoke <\s>
<s> any lingering hope that he might have any feeble hold that he might feel upon the last spar of his wrecked fortune he knew he was casting away and he let the wave of his calamity close over him <\s>
<s> pen had started up whilst he was speaking looking eagerly at him <\s>
<s> he turned his head away <\s>
<s> he saw laura rise up also and go to pen and once more take his hand and kiss it <\s>
<s> she thinks so too god bless her <\s>
<s> her father's shame is not blanche's fault dear arthur is it <\s>
<s> laura said very pale and speaking very quickly <\s>
<s> suppose you had been married would you desert her because she had done no wrong <\s>
<s> are you not pledged to her <\s>
<s> would you leave her because she is in misfortune <\s>
<s> and if she is unhappy wouldn't you console her <\s>
<s> our mother would had she been here <\s>
<s> and as she spoke the kind girl folded her arms round him and buried her face upon his heart <\s>
<s> our mother is an angel with god pen sobbed out <\s>
<s> and you are the dearest and best of women the dearest the dearest and the best <\s>
<s> teach me my duty <\s>
<s> pray for me that i may do it pure heart <\s>
<s> god bless you god bless you my sister <\s>
<s> amen groaned out warrington with his head in his hands <\s>
<s> she is right he murmured to himself <\s>
<s> she can't do any wrong i think that girl <\s>
<s> indeed she looked and smiled like an angel <\s>
<s> many a day after he saw that smile saw her radiant face as she looked up at pen saw her putting back her curls blushing and smiling and still looking fondly towards him <\s>
<s> she leaned for a moment her little fair hand on the table playing on it <\s>
<s> and now and now she said looking at the two gentlemen and what now <\s>
<s> and now we will have some tea said miss laura with her smile <\s>
<s> but before this unromantic conclusion to a rather sentimental scene could be suffered to take place a servant brought word that major pendennis had returned to the hotel and was waiting to see his nephew <\s>

<s> it is strange to take one's place and part in the midst of the smoke and din and think every man here has his secret ego most likely which is sitting lonely and apart away in the private chamber from the loud game in which the rest of us is joining <\s>
<s> arthur as he traversed the passages of the hotel felt his anger rousing up within him <\s>
<s> he was indignant to think that yonder old gentleman whom he was about to meet should have made him such a tool and puppet and so compromised his honour and good name <\s>
<s> the old fellow's hand was very cold and shaky when arthur took it <\s>

<s> he was drunk last night and challenged me to fight him pen and begad at one time i was so excited that i thought i should have driven a knife into him and the infernal rascal has made ten thousand pound i believe and deserves to be hanged and will be but curse him i wish he could have lasted out my time <\s>

<s> i ain't long for this business i am getting very old pen my boy and gad i was thinking to day as i was packing up my little library there's a bible amongst the books that belonged to my poor mother i would like you to keep that pen <\s>
<s> i was thinking sir that you would most likely open the box when it was your property and the old fellow was laid under the sod sir and the major coughed and wagged his old head over the fire <\s>

<s> i i've been aware of that eh confounded circumstance for some time <\s>
<s> i wish i had known it sooner or not at all said arthur gloomily <\s>

<s> i should have liked to keep it from you altogether and from those two poor women who are as innocent as unborn babes in the transaction <\s>
<s> there is no reason why the two women should hear it and i shall never tell them though that villain morgan perhaps may arthur said gloomily <\s>

<s> it is not a very pleasant thought to me that i am engaged to a convict's daughter <\s>
<s> the very reason why i kept it from you my dear boy <\s>

<s> miss amory is the daughter of lady clavering with fifty or sixty thousand pounds for a fortune and her father in law a baronet and country gentleman of high reputation approves of the match and gives up his seat in parliament to his son in law <\s>

<s> monstrous witty man sheridan and so was his son <\s>
<s> by gad sir when i was at the cape i remember the old gentleman's garrulity and wish to conduct arthur to the cape perhaps arose from a desire to avoid the subject which was nearest his nephew's heart but arthur broke out interrupting him if you had told me this tale sooner i believe you would have spared me and yourself a great deal of pain and disappointment and i should not have found myself tied to an engagement from which i can't in honour recede <\s>
<s> no begad we've fixed you and a man who's fixed to a seat in parliament and a pretty girl with a couple of thousand a year is fixed to no bad thing let me tell you said the old man <\s>
<s> said arthur are you blind <\s>
<s> see what young gentleman <\s>
<s> see that rather than trade upon this secret of amory's arthur cried out i would go and join my father in law at the hulks <\s>
<s> see that rather than take a seat in parliament as a bribe from clavering for silence i would take the spoons off the table <\s>
<s> see that you have given me a felon's daughter for a wife doomed me to poverty and shame cursed my career when it might have been when it might have been so different but for you <\s>
<s> don't you see that we have been playing a guilty game and have been overreached that in offering to marry this poor girl for the sake of her money and the advancement she would bring i was degrading myself and prostituting my honour <\s>
<s> what in heaven's name do you mean sir <\s>
<s> cried the old man <\s>
<s> i mean to say that there is a measure of baseness which i can't pass arthur said <\s>
<s> i have no other words for it and am sorry if they hurt you <\s>

<s> i am rightly punished by the event and having sold myself for money and a seat in parliament by losing both <\s>

<s> who the devil's to take your fortune or your seat away from you <\s>
<s> by g clavering shall give em to you <\s>

<s> not so please god arthur answered <\s>
<s> i have sinned but heaven help me i will sin no more <\s>
<s> i will let clavering off from that bargain which was made without my knowledge <\s>
<s> i will take no money with blanche but that which was originally settled upon her and i will try to make her happy <\s>
<s> you have done it <\s>
<s> you have brought this on me sir <\s>
<s> but you knew no better and i forgive arthur in god's name in your father's who by heavens was the proudest man alive and had the honour of the family always at heart in mine for the sake of a poor broken down old fellow who has always been dev'lish fond of you don't fling this chance away i pray you i beg you i implore you my dear dear boy don't fling this chance away <\s>
<s> it's the making of you <\s>
<s> you're sure to get on <\s>
<s> you'll be a baronet it's three thousand a year dammy on my knees there i beg of you don't do this <\s>
<s> and the old man actually sank down on his knees and seizing one of arthur's hands looked up piteously at him <\s>
<s> it was cruel to remark the shaking hands the wrinkled and quivering face the old eyes weeping and winking the broken voice <\s>
<s> ah sir said arthur with a groan you have brought pain enough on me spare me this <\s>
<s> you have wished me to marry blanche <\s>
<s> for god's sake sir rise <\s>
<s> i can't bear it <\s>
<s> you you mean to say that you will take her as a beggar and be one yourself <\s>
<s> said the old gentleman rising up and coughing violently <\s>
<s> i look at her as a person to whom a great calamity has befallen and to whom i am promised <\s>
<s> she cannot help the misfortune and as she had my word when she was prosperous i shall not withdraw it now she is poor <\s>
<s> i will not take clavering's seat unless afterwards it should be given of his free will <\s>
<s> i will not have a shilling more than her original fortune <\s>

<s> arthur took his hand which the old man left to him it was quite passive and clammy <\s>
<s> he looked very much oldened and it seemed as if the contest and defeat had quite broken him <\s>
<s> on the next day he kept his bed and refused to see his nephew <\s>
<s> in which the decks begin to clear when arrayed in his dressing gown pen walked up according to custom to warrington's chambers next morning to inform his friend of the issue of the last night's interview with his uncle and to ask as usual for george's advice and opinion mrs <\s>
<s> flanagan the laundress was the only person whom arthur found in the dear old chambers <\s>
<s> george had taken a carpet bag and was gone <\s>

<s> i found him at the table when i came the dear gentleman <\s>
<s> flanagan said writing at his papers and one of the candles was burned out and hard as his bed is he wasn't in it all night sir <\s>
<s> indeed having sat at the club until the brawl there became intolerable to him george had walked home and had passed the night finishing some work on which he was employed and to the completion of which he bent himself with all his might <\s>
<s> the labour was done and the night was worn away somehow and the tardy november dawn came and looked in on the young man as he sate over his desk <\s>
<s> in the next day's paper or quarter's review many of us very likely admired the work of his genius the variety of his illustration the fierce vigour of his satire the depth of his reason <\s>
<s> there was no hint in his writing of the other thoughts which occupied him and always accompanied him in his work a tone more melancholy than was customary a satire more bitter and impatient than that which he afterwards showed may have marked the writings of this period of his life to the very few persons who knew his style or his name <\s>
<s> we have said before could we know the man's feelings as well as the author's thoughts how interesting most books would be more interesting than merry <\s>
<s> i suppose harlequin's face behind his mask is always grave if not melancholy certainly each man who lives by the pen and happens to read this must remember if he will his own experiences and recall many solemn hours of solitude and labour <\s>
<s> what a constant care sate at the side of the desk and accompanied him <\s>
<s> fever or sickness were lying possibly in the next room a sick child might be there with a wife watching over it terrified and in prayer or grief might be bearing him down and the cruel mist before the eyes rendering the paper scarce visible as he wrote on it and the inexorable necessity drove on the pen <\s>
<s> what man among us has not had nights and hours like these <\s>
<s> but to the manly heart severe as these pangs are they are endurable long as the night seems the dawn comes at last and the wounds heal and the fever abates and rest comes and you can afford to look back on the past misery with feelings that are anything but bitter <\s>
<s> two or three books for reference fragments of torn up manuscript drawers open pens and inkstand lines half visible on the blotting paper a bit of sealing wax twisted and bitten and broken into sundry pieces such relics as these were about the table and pen flung himself down in george's empty chair noting things according to his wont or in spite of himself <\s>
<s> there was a gap in the bookcase next to the old college plato with the boniface arms where helen's bible used to be <\s>
<s> he has taken that with him thought pen <\s>
<s> he knew why his friend was gone <\s>
<s> dear dear old george <\s>
<s> pen rubbed his hand over his eyes <\s>
<s> oh how much wiser how much better how much nobler he is than i <\s>
<s> where was such a friend or such a brave heart <\s>
<s> where shall i ever hear such a frank voice and kind laughter <\s>
<s> where shall i ever see such a true gentleman <\s>
<s> no wonder she loved him <\s>
<s> what was i compared to him <\s>
<s> what could she do else but love him <\s>
<s> to the end of our days we will be her brothers as fate wills that we can be no more <\s>
<s> we'll be her knights and wait on her and when we're old we'll say how we loved her <\s>
<s> dear dear old george <\s>
<s> when pen descended to his own chambers his eye fell on the letter box of his outer door which he had previously overlooked and there was a little note to a <\s>
<s> p esq in george's well known handwriting george had put into pen's box probably as he was going away <\s>
<s> dear pen i shall be half way home when you breakfast and intend to stay over christmas in norfolk or elsewhere <\s>
<s> i have my own opinion of the issue of matters about which we talked in j st <\s>

<s> give my very best regards and adieux to your cousin <\s>
<s> and so george was gone and mrs <\s>
<s> flanagan the laundress ruled over his empty chambers <\s>
<s> pen of course had to go and see his uncle on the day after their colloquy and not being admitted he naturally went to lady rockminster's apartments where the old lady instantly asked for bluebeard and insisted that he should come to dinner <\s>
<s> bluebeard is gone pen said and he took out poor george's scrap of paper and handed it to laura who looked at it did not look at pen in return but passed the paper back to him and walked away <\s>
<s> pen rushed into an eloquent eulogium upon his dear old george to lady rockminster who was astonished at his enthusiasm <\s>
<s> she had never heard him so warm in praise of anybody and told him with her usual frankness that she didn't think it had been in his nature to care so much about any other person <\s>
<s> pendennis was passing in waterloo place in one of his many walks to the hotel where laura lived and whither duty to his uncle carried arthur every day arthur saw issuing from messrs <\s>
<s> gimcrack's celebrated shop an old friend who was followed to his brougham by an obsequious shopman bearing parcels <\s>
<s> the gentleman was in the deepest mourning the brougham the driver and the horse were in mourning <\s>
<s> grief in easy circumstances and supported by the comfortablest springs and cushions was typified in the equipage and the little gentleman its proprietor <\s>
<s> cried out pen the reader no doubt has likewise recognised arthur's old schoolfellow and he held out his hand to the heir of the late lamented john henry foker esq the master of logwood and other houses the principal partner in the great brewery of foker and co the greater portion of foker's entire <\s>
<s> a little hand covered with a glove of the deepest ebony and set off by three inches of a snowy wristband was put forth to meet arthur's salutation <\s>
<s> the other little hand held a little morocco case containing no doubt something precious of which mr <\s>
<s> foker had just become proprietor in messrs <\s>
<s> pen's keen eyes and satiric turn showed him at once upon what errand mr <\s>
<s> foker had been employed and he thought of the heir in horace pouring forth the gathered wine of his father's vats and that human nature is pretty much the same in regent street as in the via sacra <\s>
<s> le roi est mort <\s>
<s> thank you very much obliged <\s>
<s> how do you do pen very busy good bye <\s>
<s> and he jumped into the black brougham and sate like a little black care behind the black coachman <\s>
<s> he had blushed on seeing pen and shown other signs of guilt and perturbation which pen attributed to the novelty of his situation and on which he began to speculate in his usual sardonic manner <\s>
<s> yes so wags the world thought pen <\s>
<s> the stone closes over harry the fourth and harry the fifth reigns in his stead <\s>
<s> the old ministers at the brewery come and kneel before him with their books the draymen his subjects fling up their red caps and shout for him <\s>
<s> what a grave deference and sympathy the bankers and the lawyers show <\s>
<s> there was too great a stake at issue between those two that they should ever love each other very cordially <\s>
<s> as long as one man keeps another out of twenty thousand a year the younger must be always hankering after the crown and the wish must be the father to the thought of possession <\s>
<s> thank heaven there was no thought of money between me and our dear mother laura <\s>
<s> there never could have been <\s>
<s> you would have spurned it <\s>
<s> why make yourself more selfish than you are pen and allow your mind to own for an instant that it would have entertained such such dreadful meanness <\s>
<s> you make me blush for you arthur you make me her eyes finished this sentence and she passed her handkerchief across them <\s>
<s> there are some truths which women will never acknowledge pen said and from which your modesty always turns away <\s>
<s> i do not say that i ever knew the feeling only that i am glad i had not the temptation <\s>
<s> is there any harm in that confession of weakness <\s>
<s> we are all taught to ask to be delivered from evil arthur said laura in a low voice <\s>
<s> i am glad if you were spared from that great crime and only sorry to think that you could by any possibility have been led into it <\s>
<s> but you never could and you don't think you could <\s>
<s> your acts are generous and kind you disdain mean actions <\s>

<s> oh if you knew the pain you give me how i lie awake and think of those hard sentences dear brother and wish them unspoken unthought <\s>
<s> do i cause you many thoughts and many tears laura <\s>
<s> the fulness of innocent love beamed from her in reply <\s>
<s> a smile heavenly pure a glance of unutterable tenderness sympathy pity shone in her face all which indications of love and purity arthur beheld and worshipped in her as you would watch them in a child as one fancies one might regard them in an angel <\s>
<s> i i don't know what i have done he said simply to have merited such regard from two such women <\s>
<s> it is like undeserved praise laura or too much good fortune which frightens one or a great post when a man feels that he is not fit for it <\s>
<s> ah sister how weak and wicked we are how spotless and full of love and truth heaven made you <\s>
<s> i think for some of you there has been no fall he said looking at the charming girl with an almost paternal glance of admiration <\s>

<s> i see a sneer coming over your face <\s>

<s> but will come in spite of us <\s>
<s> but is the sceptic's familiar with whom he has made a compact and if he forgets it and indulges in happy day dreams or building of air castles or listens to sweet music let us say or to the bells ringing to church but taps at the door and says master i am here <\s>

<s> it is very pleasant to be here arthur said and we were talking when you came in about my friend foker whom i met just now and who as your ladyship knows has succeeded to his father's kingdom <\s>

<s> she has outraged every feeling of society <\s>
<s> she has broken her father's heart and thrown away fifteen thousand a year <\s>
<s> it will be the talk of the town in a day or two and there is no need why i should keep the secret any longer said lady rockminster who had written and received a dozen letters on the subject <\s>
<s> i had a letter yesterday from my daughter who was staying at drummington until all the world was obliged to go away on account of the frightful catastrophe which happened there <\s>
<s> foker came home from nice and after the funeral lady ann went down on her knees to her father said that she never could marry her cousin that she had contracted another attachment and that she must die rather than fulfil her contract <\s>
<s> poor lord rosherville who is dreadfully embarrassed showed his daughter what the state of his affairs was and that it was necessary that the arrangements should take place and in fine we all supposed that she had listened to reason and intended to comply with the desires of her family <\s>

<s> could he be still faithful to the attachment which had agitated him so much and sent him abroad eighteen months back <\s>
<s> the bracelets and presents were for some of harry's old friends of the opera or the french theatre <\s>
<s> rumours from naples and paris rumours such as are borne to club smoking rooms had announced that the young man had found distractions or precluded from his virtuous attachment the poor fellow had flung himself back upon his old companions and amusements not the only man or woman whom society forces into evil or debars from good not the only victim of the world's selfish and wicked laws <\s>
<s> as a good thing when it is to be done cannot be done too quickly laura was anxious that pen's marriage intentions should be put into execution as speedily as possible and pressed on his arrangements with rather a feverish anxiety <\s>

<s> shall we live over the offices there are four very good rooms a kitchen and a garret for laura in catherine street in the strand or would you like a house in the waterloo road it would be very pleasant only there is that halfpenny toll at the bridge <\s>
<s> the boys may go to king's college mayn't they <\s>
<s> does all this read to you like a joke <\s>
<s> ah dear blanche it is no joke and i am sober and telling the truth <\s>
<s> our fine day dreams are gone <\s>
<s> our carriage has whirled out of sight like cinderella's our house in belgravia has been whisked away into the air by a malevolent genius and i am no more a member of parliament than i am a bishop on his bench in the house of lords or a duke with a garter at his knee <\s>
<s> you know pretty well what my property is and your own little fortune we may have enough with those two to live in decent comfort to take a cab sometimes when we go out to see our friends and not to deny ourselves an omnibus when we are tired <\s>
<s> but that is all is that enough for you my little dainty lady <\s>
<s> i doubt sometimes whether you can bear the life which i offer you at least it is fair that you should know what it will be <\s>
<s> if you say yes arthur i will follow your fate whatever it may be and be a loyal and loving wife to aid and cheer you' come to me dear blanche and may god help me so that i may do my duty to you <\s>
<s> if not and you look to a higher station i must not bar blanche's fortune i will stand in the crowd and see your ladyship go to court when you are presented and you shall give me a smile from your chariot window <\s>
<s> i saw lady mirabel going to the drawing room last season the happy husband at her side glittered with stars and cordons <\s>
<s> all the flowers in the garden bloomed in the coachman's bosom <\s>
<s> will you have these and the chariot or walk on foot and mend your husband's stockings <\s>
<s> i cannot tell you now afterwards i might should the day come when we may have no secrets from one another what has happened within the last few hours which has changed all my prospects in life but so it is that i have learned something which forces me to give up the plans which i had formed and many vain and ambitious hopes in which i had been indulging <\s>
<s> i have written and despatched a letter to sir francis clavering saying that i cannot accept his seat in parliament until after my marriage in like manner i cannot and will not accept any larger fortune with you than that which has always belonged to you since your grandfather's death and the birth of your half brother <\s>
<s> your good mother is not in the least aware i hope she never may be of the reasons which force me to this very strange decision <\s>
<s> they arise from a painful circumstance which is attributable to none of our faults but having once befallen they are as fatal and irreparable as that shock which overset honest alnaschar's porcelain and shattered all his hopes beyond the power of mending <\s>
<s> i write gaily enough for there is no use in bewailing such a hopeless mischance <\s>
<s> we have not drawn the great prize in the lottery dear blanche but i shall be contented enough without it if you can be so and i repeat with all my heart that i will do my best to make you happy <\s>
<s> and now what news shall i give you <\s>
<s> my uncle is very unwell and takes my refusal of the seat in parliament in sad dudgeon the scheme was his poor old gentleman and he naturally bemoans its failure <\s>
<s> but warrington laura and i had a council of war they know this awful secret and back me in my decision <\s>
<s> you must love george as you love what is generous and upright and noble and as for laura she must be our sister blanche our saint our good angel <\s>
<s> with two such friends at home what need we care for the world without or who is member for clavering or who is asked or not asked to the great balls of the season <\s>
<s> to this frank communication came back the letter from blanche to laura and one to pen himself which perhaps his own letter justified <\s>
<s> you are spoiled by the world blanche wrote you do not love your poor blanche as she would be loved or you would not offer thus lightly to take her or to leave her no arthur you love me not a man of the world you have given me your plighted troth and are ready to redeem it but that entire affection that love whole and abiding where where is that vision of my youth <\s>
<s> i am but a pastime of your life and i would be its all but a fleeting thought and i would be your whole soul <\s>
<s> i would have our two hearts one but ah my arthur how lonely yours is <\s>
<s> how little you give me of it <\s>
<s> you speak of our parting with a smile on your lip of our meeting and you care not to hasten it <\s>
<s> is life but a disillusion then and are the flowers of our garden faded away <\s>
<s> i have wept i have prayed i have passed sleepless hours i have shed bitter bitter tears over your letter <\s>
<s> to you i bring the gushing poesy of my being the yearnings of the soul that longs to be loved that pines for love love love beyond all that flings itself at your feet and cries love me arthur <\s>
<s> your heart beats no quicker at the kneeling appeal of my love your proud eye is dimmed by no tear of sympathy you accept my soul's treasure as though twere dross <\s>
<s> not the pearls from the unfathomable deeps of affection <\s>
<s> not the diamonds from the caverns of the heart <\s>
<s> you treat me like a slave and bid me bow to my master <\s>
<s> is this the guerdon of a free maiden is this the price of a life's passion <\s>
<s> when was it otherwise <\s>
<s> when did love meet with aught but disappointment <\s>
<s> could i hope fond fool to be the exception to the lot of my race and lay my fevered brow on a heart that comprehended my own <\s>
<s> foolish girl that i was <\s>
<s> one by one all the flowers of my young life have faded away and this the last the sweetest the dearest the fondly the madly loved the wildly cherished where is it <\s>
<s> but no more of this <\s>
<s> heed not my bleeding heart bless you bless you always arthur <\s>
<s> i will write more when i am more collected <\s>
<s> my racking brain renders thought almost impossible <\s>
<s> i long to see laura <\s>
<s> she will come to us directly we return from the country will she not <\s>
<s> and you cold one <\s>
<s> the words of this letter were perfectly clear and written in blanche's neatest hand upon her scented paper and yet the meaning of the composition not a little puzzled pen <\s>
<s> did blanche mean to accept or to refuse his polite offer <\s>
<s> her phrases either meant that pen did not love her and she declined him or that she took him and sacrificed herself to him cold as he was <\s>
<s> he laughed sardonically over the letter and over the transaction which occasioned it <\s>
<s> he laughed to think how fortune had jilted him and how he deserved his slippery fortune <\s>
<s> he turned over and over the musky gilt edged riddle <\s>
<s> it amused his humour he enjoyed it as if it had been a funny story <\s>
<s> he was thus seated twiddling the queer manuscript in his hand joking grimly to himself when his servant came in with a card from a gentleman who wished to speak to him very particularly <\s>
<s> and if pen had gone out into the passage he would have seen sucking his stick rolling his eyes and showing great marks of anxiety his old acquaintance mr <\s>
<s> huxter on particular business <\s>
<s> huxter to come in said pen amused rather and not the less so when poor sam appeared before him <\s>
<s> pray take a chair mr <\s>
<s> huxter said pen in his most superb manner <\s>
<s> in what way can i be of service to you <\s>
<s> i had rather not speak before the flunk before the man mr <\s>
<s> pendennis on which mr <\s>
<s> arthur's attendant quitted the room <\s>
<s> i'm in a fix said mr <\s>
<s> she sent me to you continued the young surgeon <\s>
<s> i was coming to see her but i have had a great deal of business since my return to london <\s>
<s> i heard of you through my governor and jack hobnell broke in huxter <\s>
<s> i wish you joy mr <\s>
<s> pendennis both of the borough and the lady sir <\s>
<s> fanny wishes you joy too he added with something of a blush <\s>
<s> there's many a slip between the cup and the lip <\s>
<s> who knows what may happen mr <\s>
<s> huxter or who will sit in parliament for clavering next session <\s>
<s> you can do anything with my governor continued mr <\s>
<s> you got him clavering park <\s>
<s> the old boy was very much pleased sir at your calling him in <\s>
<s> hobnell wrote me so <\s>
<s> do you think you could speak to the governor for me mr <\s>
<s> and tell him what <\s>
<s> i've gone and done it sir said huxter with a particular look <\s>
<s> you you don't mean to say you have you have done any wrong to that dear little creature sir <\s>
<s> said pen starting up in a great fury <\s>
<s> i hope not said huxter with a hangdog look but i've married her <\s>
<s> and i know there will be an awful shindy at home <\s>
<s> it was agreed that i should be taken into partnership when i had passed the college and it was to have been huxter and son <\s>
<s> but i would have it confound it <\s>
<s> it's all over now and the old boy's wrote me that he's coming up to town for drugs he will be here to morrow and then it must all come out <\s>
<s> and when did this event happen <\s>
<s> asked pen not over well pleased most likely that a person who had once attracted some portion of his royal good graces should have transferred her allegiance and consoled herself for his loss <\s>
<s> last thursday was five weeks it was two days after miss amory came to shepherd's inn huxter answered <\s>
<s> pen remembered that blanche had written and mentioned her visit <\s>
<s> i was called in huxter said <\s>
<s> i was in the inn looking after old cos's leg and about something else too very likely and i met strong who told me there was a woman taken ill in chambers and went up to give her my professional services <\s>
<s> it was the old lady who attends miss amory her housekeeper or some such thing <\s>
<s> she was taken with strong hysterics i found her kicking and screaming like a good one in strong's chamber along with him and colonel altamont and miss amory crying and as pale as a sheet and altamont fuming about a regular kick up <\s>
<s> they were two hours in the chambers and the old woman went whooping off in a cab <\s>
<s> she was much worse than the young one <\s>
<s> i called in grosvenor place next day to see if i could be of any service but they were gone without so much as thanking me and the day after i had business of my own to attend to a bad business too said mr <\s>
<s> but it's done and can't be undone and we must make the best of it she has known the story for a month thought pen with a sharp pang of grief and a gloomy sympathy this accounts for her letter of to day <\s>
<s> she will not implicate her father or divulge his secret she wishes to let me off from the marriage and finds a pretext the generous girl <\s>
<s> do you know who altamont is sir <\s>
<s> asked huxter after the pause during which pen had been thinking of his own affairs <\s>
<s> fanny and i have talked him over and we can't help fancying that it's mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot's first husband come to life again and she who has just married a second <\s>
<s> perhaps lightfoot won't be very sorry for it sighed huxter looking savagely at arthur for the demon of jealousy was still in possession of his soul and now and more than ever since his marriage the poor fellow fancied that fanny's heart belonged to his rival <\s>
<s> let us talk about your affairs said pen <\s>
<s> show me how i can be of any service to you huxter <\s>
<s> let me congratulate you on your marriage <\s>
<s> i am thankful that fanny who is so good so fascinating so kind a creature has found an honest man and a gentleman who will make her happy <\s>
<s> show me what i can do to help you <\s>
<s> she thinks you can sir said huxter accepting pen's proffered hand and i'm very much obliged to you i'm sure and that you might talk over my father and break the business to him and my mother who always has her back up about being a clergyman's daughter <\s>
<s> fanny ain't of a good family i know and not up to us in breeding and that but she's a huxter now <\s>
<s> the wife takes the husband's rank of course said pen <\s>
<s> and with a little practice in society continued huxter imbibing his stick she'll be as good as any girl in clavering <\s>
<s> you should hear her sing and play on the piano <\s>
<s> old bows taught her <\s>
<s> and she'll do on the stage if the governor was to throw me over but i'd rather not have her there <\s>
<s> she can't help being a coquette mr <\s>
<s> pendennis she can't help it <\s>
<s> i'll be bound to say that two or three of the bartholomew chaps that i've brought into my place are sitting with her now even jack linton that i took down as my best man is as bad as the rest and she will go on singing and making eyes at him <\s>
<s> it's what bows says if there were twenty men in a room and one not taking notice of her she wouldn't be satisfied until the twentieth was at her elbow <\s>
<s> you should have her mother with her said pen laughing <\s>
<s> she must keep the lodge <\s>
<s> she can't see so much of her family as she used <\s>
<s> i can't you know sir go on with that lot <\s>
<s> consider my rank in life said huxter putting a very dirty hand up to his chin <\s>
<s> au fait said mr <\s>
<s> pen who was infinitely amused and concerning whom mutato nomine and of course concerning nobody else in the world the fable might have been narrated <\s>
<s> as the two gentlemen were in the midst of this colloquy another knock came to pen's door and his servant presently announced mr <\s>
<s> the old man followed slowly his pale face blushing and his hand trembling somewhat as he took pen's <\s>
<s> he coughed and wiped his face in his checked cotton pocket handkerchief and sate down with his hands on his knees the sunshining on his bald head <\s>
<s> pen looked at the homely figure with no small sympathy and kindness <\s>
<s> this man too has had his griefs and his wounds arthur thought <\s>
<s> this man too has brought his genius and his heart and laid them at a woman's feet where she spurned them <\s>
<s> the chance of life has gone against him and the prize is with that creature yonder <\s>
<s> fanny's bridegroom thus mutely apostrophised had winked meanwhile with one eye at old bows and was driving holes in the floor with the cane which he loved <\s>
<s> so we have lost mr <\s>
<s> bows and here is the lucky winner pen said looking hard at the old man <\s>
<s> here is the lucky winner sir as you say <\s>
<s> i suppose you have come from my place <\s>
<s> asked huxter who having winked at bows with one eye now favoured pen with a wink of the other a wink which seemed to say infatuated old boy you understand over head and ears in love with her poor old fool <\s>
<s> yes i have been there ever since you went away <\s>
<s> sam who sent me after you who said that she thought you might be doing something stupid something like yourself huxter <\s>
<s> there's as big fools as i am growled the young surgeon <\s>
<s> a few p'raps said the old man not many let us trust <\s>
<s> yes she sent me after you for fear you should offend mr <\s>
<s> pendennis and i daresay because she thought you wouldn't give her message to him and beg him to go and see her and she knew i would take her errand <\s>
<s> did he tell you that sir <\s>
<s> huxter blushed scarlet and covered his confusion with an imprecation <\s>
<s> pen laughed the scene suited his bitter humour more and more <\s>
<s> i have no doubt mr <\s>
<s> huxter was going to tell me arthur said and very much flattered i am sure i shall be to pay my respects to his wife <\s>
<s> it's in charterhouse lane over the baker's on the right hand side as you go from st <\s>
<s> john's street continued bows without any pity <\s>
<s> you know smithfield mr <\s>
<s> john's street leads into smithfield <\s>
<s> doctor johnson has been down the street many a time with ragged shoes and a bundle of penny a lining for the gent's magazine <\s>
<s> you literary gents are better off now eh <\s>
<s> you ride in your cabs and wear yellow kid gloves now <\s>
<s> i have known so many brave and good men fail and so many quacks and impostors succeed that you mistake me if you think i am puffed up by my own personal good luck old friend arthur said sadly <\s>
<s> do you think the prizes of life are carried by the most deserving <\s>
<s> and set up that mean test of prosperity for merit <\s>
<s> you must feel that you are as good as i <\s>
<s> i have never questioned it <\s>
<s> it is you that are peevish against the freaks of fortune and grudge the good luck that befalls others <\s>
<s> it's not the first time you have unjustly accused me bows <\s>
<s> perhaps you are not far wrong sir said the old fellow wiping his bald forehead <\s>
<s> i am thinking about myself and grumbling most men do when they get on that subject <\s>
<s> here's the fellow that's got the prize in the lottery here's the fortunate youth <\s>
<s> i don't know what you are driving at huxter said who had been much puzzled as the above remarks passed between his two companions <\s>
<s> perhaps not said bows drily <\s>
<s> sent me here to look after you and to see that you brought that little message to mr <\s>
<s> pendennis which you didn't you see and so she was right <\s>
<s> women always are they have always a reason for everything <\s>
<s> why sir he said turning round to pen with a sneer she had a reason even for giving me that message <\s>
<s> i was sitting with her after you left us very quiet and comfortable i was talking away and she was mending your shirts when your two young friends jack linton and bob blades looked in from bartholomew's and then it was she found out that she had this message to send <\s>
<s> you needn't hurry yourself she don't want you back again they'll stay these two hours i daresay <\s>
<s> huxter arose with great perturbation at this news and plunged his stick into the pocket of his paletot and seized his hat <\s>
<s> you'll come and see us sir won't you <\s>
<s> he said to pen <\s>
<s> you'll talk over the governor won't you sir if i can get out of this place and down to clavering <\s>
<s> you will promise to attend me gratis if ever i fall ill at fairoaks will you huxter <\s>
<s> i will do anything i can for you <\s>
<s> i will come and see mrs <\s>
<s> huxter immediately and we will conspire together about what is to be done <\s>
<s> i thought that would send him out sir bows said dropping into his chair again as soon as the young surgeon had quitted the room <\s>
<s> and it's all true sir every word of it <\s>
<s> she wants you back again and sends her husband after you <\s>
<s> she cajoles everybody the little devil <\s>
<s> she tries it on you on me on poor costigan on the young chaps from bartholomew's <\s>
<s> she's got a little court of em already <\s>
<s> and if there's nobody there she practises on the old german baker in the shop or coaxes the black sweeper at the crossing <\s>
<s> is she fond of that fellow <\s>
<s> there is no accounting for likes and dislikes bows answered <\s>
<s> yes she is fond of him and having taken the thing into her head she would not rest until she married him <\s>
<s> they had their banns published at st <\s>
<s> clement's and nobody heard it or knew any just cause or impediment <\s>
<s> and one day she slips out of the porter's lodge and has the business done and goes off to gravesend with lothario and leaves a note for me to go and explain all things to her ma <\s>
<s> the old woman knew it as well as i did though she pretended ignorance <\s>
<s> and so she goes and i'm alone again <\s>
<s> i miss her sir tripping along that court and coming for her singing lesson and i've no heart to look into the porter's lodge now which looks very empty without her the little flirting thing <\s>
<s> and i go and sit and dangle about her lodgings like an old fool <\s>
<s> she makes em very trim and nice though gets up all huxter's shirts and clothes cooks his little dinner and sings at her business like a little lark <\s>
<s> what's the use of being angry <\s>
<s> i lent em three pound to go on with for they haven't got a shilling till the reconciliation and pa comes down <\s>
<s> when bows had taken his leave pen carried his letter from blanche and the news which he had just received to his usual adviser laura <\s>
<s> it was wonderful upon how many points mr <\s>
<s> arthur who generally followed his own opinion now wanted another person's counsel <\s>
<s> he could hardly so much as choose a waistcoat without referring to miss bell if he wanted to buy a horse he must have miss bell's opinion all which marks of deference tended greatly to the amusement of the shrewd old lady with whom miss bell lived and whose plans regarding her protegee we have indicated <\s>
<s> arthur produced blanche's letter then to laura and asked her to interpret it <\s>
<s> laura was very much agitated and puzzled by the contents of the note <\s>
<s> it seems to me she said as if blanche is acting very artfully <\s>
<s> and wishes so to place matters that she may take me or leave me <\s>
<s> is it not so <\s>
<s> it is i am afraid a kind of duplicity which does not augur well for your future happiness and is a bad reply to your own candour and honesty arthur <\s>
<s> do you know i think i think i scarcely like to say what i think said laura with a deep blush but of course the blushing young lady yielded to her cousin's persuasion and expressed what her thoughts were <\s>
<s> it looks to me arthur as if there might be there might be somebody else said laura with a repetition of the blush <\s>
<s> and if there is broke in arthur and if i am free once again will the best and dearest of all women you are not free dear brother laura said calmly <\s>
<s> you belong to another of whom i own it grieves me to think ill <\s>
<s> but i can't do otherwise <\s>
<s> it is very odd that in this letter she does not urge you to tell her the reason why you have broken arrangements which would have been so advantageous to you and avoids speaking on the subject <\s>
<s> she somehow seems to write as if she knows her father's secret <\s>
<s> pen said yes she must know it and told the story which he had just heard from huxter of the interview at shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> it was not so that she described the meeting said laura and going to her desk produced from it that letter of blanche's which mentioned her visit to shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> another disappointment only the chevalier strong and a friend of his in the room <\s>
<s> this was all that blanche had said <\s>
<s> but she was bound to keep her father's secret pen laura added <\s>
<s> and yet and yet it is very puzzling <\s>
<s> the puzzle was this that for three weeks after this eventful discovery blanche had been only too eager about her dearest arthur was urging as strongly as so much modesty could urge the completion of the happy arrangements which were to make her arthur's for ever and now it seemed as if something had interfered to mar these happy arrangements as if arthur poor was not quite so agreeable to blanche as arthur rich and a member of parliament as if there was some mystery <\s>
<s> at last she said tunbridge wells is not very far off is it arthur <\s>
<s> hadn't you better go and see her <\s>
<s> they had been in town a week and neither had thought of that simple plan before <\s>
<s> shows how arthur had better have taken a return ticket the train carried arthur only too quickly to tunbridge though he had time to review all the circumstances of his life as he made the brief journey and to acknowledge to what sad conclusions his selfishness and waywardness had led him <\s>
<s> here is the end of hopes and aspirations thought he of romance and ambitions <\s>
<s> where i yield or where i am obstinate i am alike unfortunate my mother implores me and i refuse an angel <\s>
<s> say i had taken her forced on me as she was laura would never have been an angel to me <\s>
<s> i could not have given her my heart at another's instigation i never could have known her as she is had i been obliged to ask another to interpret her qualities and point out her virtues <\s>
<s> i yield to my uncle's solicitations and accept on his guarantee blanche and a seat in parliament and wealth and ambition and a career and see fortune comes and leaves me the wife without the dowry which i had taken in compensation of a heart <\s>
<s> why was i not more honest or am i not less so <\s>
<s> it would have cost my poor old uncle no pangs to accept blanche's fortune whencesoever it came he can't even understand he is bitterly indignant heart stricken almost at the scruples which actuate me in refusing it <\s>
<s> a maimed weak imperfect wretch it seems as if i am unequal to any fortune <\s>
<s> i neither make myself nor any one connected with me happy <\s>
<s> what prospect is there for this poor little frivolous girl who is to take my obscure name and share my fortune <\s>
<s> i have not even ambition to excite me or self esteem enough to console myself much more her for my failure <\s>
<s> if i were to write a book that should go through twenty editions why i should be the very first to sneer at my reputation <\s>
<s> say i could succeed at the bar and achieve a fortune by bullying witnesses and twisting evidence is that a fame which would satisfy my longings or a calling in which my life would be well spent <\s>
<s> how i wish i could be that priest opposite who never has lifted his eyes from his breviary except when we were in reigate tunnel when he could not see or that old gentleman next him who scowls at him with eyes of hatred over his newspaper <\s>
<s> the priest shuts his eyes to the world but has his thoughts on the book which is his directory to the world to come <\s>
<s> his neighbour hates him as a monster tyrant persecutor and fancies burning martyrs and that pale countenance looking on and lighted up by the flame <\s>
<s> these have no doubts these march on trustfully bearing their load of logic <\s>
<s> would you like to look at the paper sir <\s>
<s> here interposed the stout gentleman it had a flaming article against the order of the black coated gentleman who was travelling with them in the carriage and pen thanked him and took it and pursued his reverie without reading two sentences of the journal <\s>
<s> and yet would you take either of those men's creeds with its consequences <\s>
<s> you must bear your own burthen fashion your own faith think your own thoughts and pray your own prayer <\s>
<s> to what mortal ear could i tell all if i had a mind <\s>
<s> or who could understand all <\s>
<s> who can tell another's shortcomings lost opportunities weigh the passions which overpower the defects which incapacitate reason what extent of truth and right his neighbour's mind is organised to perceive and to do what invisible and forgotten accident terror of youth chance or mischance of fortune may have altered the whole current of life <\s>
<s> a grain of sand may alter it as the flinging of a pebble may end it <\s>
<s> who can weigh circumstances passions temptations that go to our good and evil account save one before whose awful wisdom we kneel and at whose mercy we ask absolution <\s>
<s> here it ends thought pen this day or to morrow will wind up the account of my youth a weary retrospect alas <\s>
<s> a sad history with many a page i would fain not look back on <\s>
<s> but who has not been tired or fallen and who has escaped without scars from that struggle <\s>
<s> and his head fell on his breast and the young man's heart prostrated itself humbly and sadly before that throne where sits wisdom and love and pity for all and made its confession <\s>
<s> what matters about fame or poverty <\s>
<s> if i marry this woman i have chosen may i have strength and will to be true to her and to make her happy <\s>
<s> if i have children pray god teach me to speak and to do the truth among them and to leave them an honest name <\s>
<s> there are no splendours for my marriage <\s>
<s> does my life deserve any <\s>
<s> i begin a new phase of it a better than the last may it be i pray heaven <\s>
<s> the train stopped at tunbridge as pen was making these reflections and he handed over the newspaper to his neighbour of whom he took leave while the foreign clergyman in the opposite corner still sate with his eyes on his book <\s>
<s> pen jumped out of the carriage then his carpet bag in hand and briskly determined to face his fortune <\s>
<s> a fly carried him rapidly to lady clavering's house from the station and as he was transported thither arthur composed a little speech which he intended to address to blanche and which was really as virtuous honest and well minded an oration as any man of his turn of mind and under his circumstances could have uttered <\s>
<s> the purport of it was blanche i cannot understand from your last letter what your meaning is or whether my fair and frank proposal to you is acceptable or no <\s>
<s> i think you know the reason which induces me to forgo the worldly advantages which a union with you offered and which i could not accept without as i fancy being dishonoured <\s>
<s> if you doubt of my affection here i am ready to prove it <\s>
<s> let smirke be called in and let us be married out of hand and with all my heart i purpose to keep my vow and to cherish you through life and to be a true and a loving husband to you <\s>
<s> from the fly arthur sprang out then to the hall door where he was met by a domestic whom he did not know <\s>
<s> the man seemed to be surprised at the approach of the gentleman with the carpet bag which he made no attempt to take from arthur's hands <\s>
<s> her ladyship's not at home sir the man remarked <\s>
<s> lightfoot is gone answered the man <\s>
<s> my lady is out and my orders was i hear miss amory's voice in the drawing room said arthur <\s>
<s> take the bag to a dressing room if you please and passing by the porter he walked straight towards that apartment from which as the door opened a warble of melodious notes issued <\s>
<s> our little siren was at her piano singing with all her might and fascinations <\s>
<s> master clavering was asleep on the sofa indifferent to the music but near blanche sat a gentleman who was perfectly enraptured with her strain which was of a passionate and melancholy nature <\s>
<s> as the door opened the gentleman started up with hullo <\s>
<s> the music stopped with a little shriek from the singer frank clavering woke up from the sofa and arthur came forward and said what foker <\s>
<s> how do you do foker <\s>
<s> he looked at the piano and there by miss amory's side was just such another purple leather box as he had seen in harry's hand three days before when the heir of logwood was coming out of a jeweller's shop in waterloo place <\s>
<s> it was opened and curled round the white satin cushion within was oh such a magnificent serpentine bracelet with such a blazing ruby head and diamond tail <\s>
<s> blanche made many motions of the shoulders and gave signs of unrest and agitation <\s>
<s> and she put her handkerchief over the bracelet and then she advanced with a hand which trembled very much to greet pen <\s>
<s> how is dearest laura <\s>
<s> the face of foker looking up from his profound mourning that face so piteous and puzzled was one which the reader's imagination must depict for himself also that of master frank clavering who looking at the three interesting individuals with an expression of the utmost knowingness had only time to ejaculate the words here's a jolly go <\s>
<s> and to disappear sniggering <\s>
<s> pen too had restrained himself up to that minute but looking still at foker whose ears and cheeks tingled with blushes arthur burst out into a fit of laughter so wild and loud that it frightened blanche much more than any the most serious exhibition <\s>
<s> and this was the secret was it <\s>
<s> don't blush and turn away foker my boy <\s>

<s> pen had never seen her or known so much about her in all the years of their intimacy as he saw and knew now though he saw more than existed in reality <\s>
<s> for this young lady was not able to carry out any emotion to the full but had a sham enthusiasm a sham hatred a sham love a sham taste a sham grief each of which flared and shone very vehemently for an instant but subsided and gave place to the next sham emotion <\s>
<s> a chapter of match making upon the platform at tunbridge pen fumed and fretted until the arrival of the evening train to london a full half hour six hours it seemed to him but even this immense interval was passed the train arrived the train sped on the london lights came in view a gentleman who forgot his carpet bag in the train rushed at a cab and said to the man drive as hard as you can go to jermyn street <\s>
<s> the cabman although a hansom cabman said thank you for the gratuity which was put into his hand and pen ran up the stairs of the hotel to lady rockminster's apartments <\s>

<s> in a word directly he entered the room pen went up to laura of the pale face who had not time even to say what back so soon <\s>

<s> i have been to tunbridge he says and seen miss amory and find on my arrival that that a villain has transplanted me in her affections he says with a tragedy air <\s>
<s> is that what you were whimpering on your knees about <\s>

<s> you might have kept the news till to morrow <\s>
<s> yes another has superseded me goes on pen but why call him villain <\s>
<s> he is brave he is constant he is young he is wealthy he is beautiful <\s>
<s> what stuff are you talking sir <\s>
<s> cried the old lady <\s>
<s> miss amory has jilted me and accepted henry foker esq <\s>
<s> i found her warbling ditties to him as he lay at her feet presents had been accepted vows exchanged these ten days <\s>
<s> harry was old mrs <\s>
<s> planter's rheumatism which kept dearest laura out of the house <\s>
<s> he is the most constant and generous of men <\s>
<s> he has promised the living of logwood to lady ann's husband and given her a splendid present on her marriage and he rushed to fling himself at blanche's feet the instant he found he was free <\s>
<s> and so as you can't get blanche you put up with laura is that it sir <\s>
<s> asked the old lady <\s>
<s> he acted nobly laura said <\s>
<s> i acted as she bade me said pen <\s>
<s> never mind how lady rockminster but to the best of my knowledge and power <\s>
<s> and if you mean that i am not worthy of laura i know it and pray heaven to better me and if the love and company of the best and purest creature in the world can do so at least i shall have these to help me <\s>
<s> hm hm replied the old lady to this looking with rather an appeased air at the young people <\s>
<s> it is all very well but i should have preferred bluebeard <\s>
<s> and now pen to divert the conversation from a theme which was growing painful to some parties present bethought him of his interview with huxter in the morning and of fanny bolton's affairs which he had forgotten under the immediate pressure and excitement of his own <\s>
<s> and he told the ladies how huxter had elevated fanny to the rank of wife and what terrors he was in respecting the arrival of his father <\s>
<s> he described the scene with considerable humour taking care to dwell especially upon that part of it which concerned fanny's coquetry and irrepressible desire of captivating mankind his meaning being you see laura i was not so guilty in that little affair it was the girl who made love to me and i who resisted <\s>
<s> as i am no longer present the little siren practises her arts and fascinations upon others <\s>
<s> let that transaction be forgotten in your mind if you please or visit me with a very gentle punishment for my error <\s>
<s> laura understood his meaning under the eagerness of his explanations <\s>
<s> if you did any wrong you repented dear pen she said and you know she added with meaning eyes and blushes that i have no right to reproach you <\s>
<s> grumbled the old lady i should have preferred bluebeard <\s>
<s> the past is broken away <\s>
<s> the morrow is before us <\s>
<s> i will do my best to make your morrow happy dear laura pen said <\s>
<s> his heart was humbled by the prospect of his happiness it stood awestricken in the contemplation of her sweet goodness and purity <\s>
<s> he liked his wife better that she had owned to that passing feeling for warrington and laid bare her generous heart to him <\s>
<s> and she very likely she was thinking how strange it is that i ever should have cared for another <\s>
<s> i am vexed almost to think i care for him so little am so little sorry that he is gone away <\s>
<s> oh in these past two months how i have learned to love arthur <\s>
<s> i care about nothing but arthur my waking and sleeping thoughts are about him he is never absent from me <\s>
<s> and to think that he is to be mine mine <\s>
<s> and that i am to marry him and not to be his servant as i expected to be only this morning for i would have gone down on my knees to blanche to beg her to let me live with him <\s>

<s> mother that you were here <\s>
<s> indeed she felt as if helen were there by her actually though invisibly <\s>
<s> a halo of happiness beamed from her <\s>
<s> she moved with a different step and bloomed with a new beauty <\s>
<s> arthur saw the change and the old lady rockminster remarked it with her shrewd eyes <\s>
<s> what a sly demure little wretch you have been she whispered to laura while pen in great spirits was laughing and telling his story about huxter and how you have kept your secret <\s>
<s> how are we to help the young couple <\s>
<s> of course miss laura felt an interest in all young couples as generous lovers always love other lovers <\s>
<s> we must go and see them said pen <\s>
<s> of course we must go and see them said laura <\s>
<s> i intend to be very fond of fanny <\s>

<s> i will come and fetch you with martha <\s>

<s> a parcel of stuff said the old lady <\s>

<s> there my head is turned another way <\s>
<s> good night young people <\s>
<s> and who knows but the old lady thought of her own early days as she went away on laura's arm nodding her head and humming to herself <\s>
<s> with the early morning came laura and martha according to appointment and the desired sensation was let us hope effected in lamb court whence the three proceeded to wait upon mr <\s>

<s> while fanny is answering these questions in reply to pen laura says to herself well now really <\s>
<s> is this the creature about whom we were all so frightened <\s>
<s> what could he see in her <\s>
<s> she's a homely little thing but such manners <\s>
<s> well she was very kind to him bless her for that <\s>
<s> samuel had gone out to meet his pa <\s>
<s> huxter said that the old gentleman was to arrive that day at the somerset coffee house in the strand and fanny confessed that she was in a sad tremor about the meeting <\s>

<s> i shall never pardon myself for bringing ruing on my usband's ead <\s>
<s> you must intercede for us mr <\s>
<s> if mortal man can you can bend and influence mr <\s>
<s> fanny still regarded pen in the light of a superior being that was evident <\s>
<s> no doubt arthur thought of the past as he marked the solemn little tragedy airs and looks the little ways the little trepidations vanities of the little bride <\s>
<s> as soon as the interview was over entered messrs <\s>
<s> linton and blades who came of course to visit huxter and brought with them a fine fragrance of tobacco <\s>
<s> they had watched the carriage at the baker's door and remarked the coronet with awe <\s>
<s> they asked of fanny who was that uncommonly heavy swell who had just driven off <\s>
<s> and pronounced the countess was of the right sort <\s>
<s> and when they heard that it was mr <\s>
<s> pendennis and his sister they remarked that pen's father was only a sawbones and that he gave himself confounded airs they had been in huxter's company on the night of his little altercation with pen in the back kitchen <\s>
<s> returning homewards through fleet street and as laura was just stating to pen's infinite amusement that fanny was very well but that really there was no beauty in her there might be but she could not see it as they were locked near temple bar they saw young huxter returning to his bride <\s>
<s> the governor had arrived was at the somerset coffee house was in tolerable good humour something about the railway but he had been afraid to speak about about that business <\s>
<s> pendennis try it on <\s>
<s> pen said he would go and call at that moment upon mr <\s>
<s> huxter and see what might be done <\s>
<s> huxter junior would lurk outside whilst that awful interview took place <\s>
<s> the coronet on the carriage inspired his soul also with wonder and old mr <\s>
<s> huxter himself beheld it with delight as he looked from the coffee house window on that strand which it was always a treat to him to survey <\s>
<s> and i can afford to give myself a lark sir said mr <\s>
<s> huxter shaking hands with pen <\s>
<s> of course you know the news <\s>
<s> we have got our bill sir <\s>
<s> we shall have our branch line our shares are up sir and we buy your three fields along the brawl and put a pretty penny into your pocket mr <\s>
<s> indeed that was good news <\s>
<s> pen remembered that there was a letter from mr <\s>

<s> i hope you don't intend to grow rich and give up practice said pen <\s>
<s> we can't lose you at clavering mr <\s>
<s> huxter though i hear very good accounts of your son <\s>
<s> goodenough speaks most highly of his talents <\s>
<s> it is hard that a man of your eminence though should be kept in a country town <\s>
<s> the metropolis would have been my sphere of action sir said mr <\s>
<s> huxter surveying the strand <\s>
<s> but a man takes his business where he finds it and i succeeded to that of my father <\s>
<s> it was my father's too said pen <\s>
<s> i sometimes wish i had followed it <\s>
<s> you sir have taken a more lofty career said the old gentleman <\s>
<s> you aspire to the senate and to literary honours <\s>
<s> you wield the poet's pen sir and move in the circles of fashion <\s>
<s> we keep an eye upon you at clavering <\s>
<s> we read your name in the lists of the select parties of the nobility <\s>
<s> why it was only the other day that my wife was remarking how odd it was that at a party at the earl of kidderminster's your name was not mentioned <\s>
<s> to what member of the aristocracy may i ask does that equipage belong from which i saw you descend <\s>
<s> the countess dowager of rockminster <\s>

<s> her ladyship is not very well and when i heard that you were coming to town i strongly urged her to see you mr <\s>
<s> old huxter felt if he had a hundred votes for clavering he would give them all to pen <\s>

<s> the old surgeon was delighted to speak to a coroneted carriage in the midst of the full strand he ran out bowing and smiling <\s>
<s> huxter junior dodging about the district beheld the meeting between his father and laura saw the latter put out her hand and presently after a little colloquy with pen beheld his father actually jump into the carriage and drive away with miss bell <\s>
<s> there was no room for arthur who came back laughing to the young surgeon and told him whither his parent was bound <\s>
<s> during the whole of the journey that artful laura coaxed and wheedled and cajoled him so adroitly that the old gentleman would have granted her anything and lady rockminster achieved the victory over him by complimenting him on his skill and professing her anxiety to consult him <\s>

<s> should he meet her ladyship's usual medical attendant <\s>
<s> jones was called out of town <\s>
<s> he should be delighted to devote his very best energies and experience to her ladyship's service <\s>
<s> he was so charmed with his patient that he wrote home about her to his wife and family he talked of nothing but lady rockminster to samuel when that youth came to partake of beefsteak and oyster sauce and accompany his parent to the play <\s>
<s> there was a simple grandeur a polite urbanity a high bred grace about her ladyship which he had never witnessed in any woman <\s>
<s> her symptoms did not seem alarming he had prescribed spir ammon aromat with a little spir menth pip and orange flower which would be all that was necessary <\s>
<s> miss bell seemed to be on the most confidential and affectionate footing with her ladyship <\s>
<s> she was about to form a matrimonial connexion <\s>
<s> all young people ought to marry <\s>
<s> such were her ladyship's words and the countess condescended to ask respecting my own family and i mentioned you by name to her ladyship sam my boy <\s>
<s> i shall look in to morrow when if the remedies which i have prescribed for her ladyship have had the effect which i anticipate i shall probably follow them up by a little spir lavend comp and so set my noble patient up <\s>

<s> i agree with so fair an authority said the old gentleman with a bow <\s>
<s> and and suppose sir pen said that i had a piece of news to communicate to you <\s>
<s> god bless my soul mr <\s>

<s> suppose i were to tell you that that man is my friend that our excellent our truly noble friend the countess dowager of rockminster is truly interested about him and you may fancy what a young man can do in life when that family is interested for him ); suppose i were to tell you that you know him that he is here that he is sam married <\s>

<s> the ingenious reader will be enabled by the help of the above announcement to understand what has taken place during the little break which has occurred in our narrative <\s>
<s> although lady rockminster grumbled a little at laura's preference for pendennis over bluebeard those who are aware of the latter's secret will understand that the young girl could make no other choice and the kind old lady who had constituted herself miss bell's guardian was not ill pleased that she was to fulfil the great purpose in life of young ladies and marry <\s>
<s> she informed her maid of the interesting event that very night and of course mrs <\s>
<s> beck who was perfectly aware of every single circumstance and kept by martha of fairoaks in the fullest knowledge of what was passing was immensely surprised and delighted <\s>
<s> pendennis's income is so much the railroad will give him so much more he states miss bell has so much and may probably have a little more one day <\s>
<s> for persons in their degree they will be able to manage very well <\s>
<s> and i shall speak to my nephew pynsent who i suspect was once rather attached to her but of course that was out of the question oh <\s>
<s> of course my lady i should think so indeed not that you know anything whatever about it or have any business to think at all on the subject i shall speak to george pynsent who is now chief secretary of the tape and sealing wax office and have mr <\s>
<s> and beck in the morning you will carry down my compliments to major pendennis and say that i shall pay him a visit at one o'clock yes muttered the old lady the major must be reconciled and he must leave his fortune to laura's children <\s>
<s> accordingly at one o'clock the dowager lady rockminster appeared at major pendennis's who was delighted as may be imagined to receive so noble a visitor <\s>
<s> the major had been prepared if not for the news which her ladyship was about to give him at least with the intelligence that pen's marriage with miss amory was broken off <\s>
<s> the young gentleman bethinking him of his uncle for the first time that day it must be owned and meeting his new servant in the hall of the hotel asked after the major's health from mr <\s>
<s> frosch and then went into the coffee room of the hotel where he wrote a half dozen lines to acquaint his guardian with what had occurred <\s>
<s> dear uncle he said if there has been any question between us it is over now <\s>
<s> i went to tunbridge wells yesterday and found that somebody else had carried off the prize about which we were hesitating <\s>
<s> miss a without any compunction for me has bestowed herself upon harry foker with his fifteen thousand a year <\s>
<s> i came in suddenly upon their loves and found and left him in possession <\s>
<s> and you'll be glad to hear tatham writes me that he has sold three of my fields at fairoaks to the railroad company at a great figure <\s>
<s> i will tell you this and more when we meet and am always your affectionate a <\s>
<s> i think i am aware of what you were about to tell me the major said with a most courtly smile and bow to pen's ambassadress <\s>
<s> it was a very great kindness of your ladyship to think of bringing me the news <\s>
<s> how well you look <\s>
<s> how very good you are <\s>
<s> how very kind you have always been to that young man <\s>
<s> it was for the sake of his uncle said lady rockminster most politely <\s>
<s> he has informed me of the state of affairs and written me a nice note yes a nice note continued the old gentleman and i find he has had an increase to his fortune yes and all things considered i don't much regret that this affair with miss amory is manquee though i wished for it once in fact all things considered i am very glad of it <\s>
<s> we must console him major pendennis continued the lady we must get him a wife <\s>
<s> the truth then came across the major's mind and he saw for what purpose lady rockminster had chosen to assume the office of ambassadress <\s>
<s> it is not necessary to enter into the conversation which ensued or to tell at any length how her ladyship concluded a negotiation which in truth was tolerably easy <\s>
<s> there could be no reason why pen should not marry according to his own and his mother's wish and as for lady rockminster she supported the marriage by intimations which had very great weight with the major but of which we shall say nothing as her ladyship now of course much advanced in years is still alive and the family might be angry and in fine the old gentleman was quite overcome by the determined graciousness of the lady and her fondness for laura <\s>
<s> nothing indeed could be more bland and kind than lady rockminster's whole demeanour except for one moment when the major talked about his boy throwing himself away at which her ladyship broke out into a little speech in which she made the major understand what poor pen and his friends acknowledge very humbly that laura was a thousand times too good for him <\s>
<s> laura was fit to be the wife of a king laura was a paragon of virtue and excellence <\s>
<s> and it must be said that when major pendennis found that a lady of the rank of the countess of rockminster seriously admired miss bell he instantly began to admire her himself <\s>
<s> so that when herr frosch was requested to walk upstairs to lady rockminster's apartments and inform miss bell and mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis that the major would receive them and laura appeared blushing and happy as she hung on pen's arm the major gave a shaky hand to one and the other with unaffected emotion and cordiality and then went through another salutation to laura which caused her to blush still more <\s>
<s> bright eyes beaming with the light of love <\s>
<s> the story teller turns from this group to his young audience and hopes that one day their eyes may all shine so <\s>
<s> pen having retreated in the most friendly manner and the lovely blanche having bestowed her young affections upon a blushing bridegroom with fifteen thousand a year there was such an outbreak of happiness in lady clavering's heart and family as the good begum had not known for many a year and she and blanche were on the most delightful terms of cordiality and affection <\s>
<s> the ardent foker pressed onwards the happy day and was as anxious as might be expected to abridge the period of mourning which had put him in possession of so many charms and amiable qualities of which he had been only as it were the heir apparent not the actual owner until then <\s>
<s> the gentle blanche everything that her affianced lord could desire was not averse to gratify the wishes of her fond henry <\s>
<s> lady clavering came up from tunbridge <\s>
<s> milliners and jewellers were set to work and engaged to prepare the delightful paraphernalia of hymen <\s>
<s> lady clavering was in such a good humour that sir francis even benefited by it and such a reconciliation was effected between this pair that sir francis came to london sate at the head of his own table once more and appeared tolerably flush of money at his billiard rooms and gambling houses again <\s>
<s> one day when major pendennis and arthur went to dine in grosvenor place they found an old acquaintance established in the quality of major domo and the gentleman in black who with perfect politeness and gravity offered them their choice of sweet or dry champagne was no other than mr <\s>
<s> the chevalier strong was one of the party he was in high spirits and condition and entertained the company with accounts of his amusements abroad <\s>
<s> it was my lady who invited me said strong to arthur under his voice that fellow morgan looked as black as thunder when i came in <\s>
<s> he is about no good here <\s>
<s> i will go away first and wait for you and major pendennis at hyde park gate <\s>
<s> morgan helped major pendennis to his great coat when he was quitting the house and muttered something about having accepted a temporary engagement with the clavering family <\s>
<s> i have got a paper of yours mr <\s>
<s> morgan said the old gentleman <\s>
<s> which you can show if you please to sir francis sir and perfectly welcome said mr <\s>
<s> morgan with downcast eyes <\s>
<s> i'm very much obliged to you major pendennis and if i can pay you for all your kindness i will <\s>
<s> arthur overheard the sentence and saw the look of hatred which accompanied it suddenly cried out that he had forgotten his handkerchief and ran upstairs to the drawing room again <\s>
<s> foker was still there still lingering about his siren <\s>
<s> pen gave the siren a look full of meaning and we suppose that the siren understood meaning looks for when after finding the veracious handkerchief of which he came in quest he once more went out the siren with a laughing voice said oh arthur mr <\s>
<s> pendennis i want you to tell dear laura something <\s>
<s> and she came out to the door <\s>
<s> she asked shutting the door <\s>
<s> have you told harry <\s>
<s> do you know that villain morgan knows all <\s>
<s> i know it she said <\s>
<s> have you told harry <\s>
<s> no no she said <\s>
<s> you won't betray me <\s>
<s> morgan will said pen <\s>
<s> no he won't said blanche <\s>
<s> i have promised him n'importe <\s>
<s> wait until after our marriage oh until after our marriage oh how wretched i am said the girl who had been all smiles and grace and gaiety during the evening <\s>
<s> arthur said i beg and implore you to tell harry <\s>
<s> it is no fault of yours <\s>
<s> he will pardon you anything <\s>
<s> and give her this il est la with my love please and i beg your pardon for calling you back and if she will be at madame crinoline's at half past three and if lady rockminster can spare her i should so like to drive with her in the park and she went in singing and kissing her little hand as morgan the velvet footed came up the carpeted stair <\s>
<s> pen heard blanche's piano breaking out into brilliant music as he went down to join his uncle and they walked away together <\s>
<s> arthur briefly told him what he had done <\s>
<s> what was to be done <\s>
<s> what is to be done begad <\s>
<s> said the old gentleman <\s>
<s> what is to be done but to leave it alone <\s>
<s> begad let us be thankful said the old fellow with a shudder that we are out of the business and leave it to those it concerns <\s>
<s> i hope to heaven she'll tell him said pen <\s>
<s> begad she'll take her own course said the old man <\s>
<s> miss amory is a dev'lish wide awake girl sir and must play her own cards and i'm doosid glad you are out of it doosid glad begad <\s>
<s> he wants to put in his oar i suppose <\s>
<s> i tell you don't meddle in the business arthur <\s>
<s> strong began once or twice as if to converse upon the subject but the major would not hear a word <\s>
<s> he remarked on the moonlight on apsley house the weather the cabstands anything but that subject <\s>
<s> he bowed stiffly to strong and clung to his nephew's arm as he turned down st <\s>
<s> james's street and again cautioned pen to leave the affair alone <\s>
<s> it had like to have cost you so much sir that you may take my advice he said <\s>
<s> when arthur came out of the hotel strong's cloak and cigar were visible a few doors off <\s>
<s> the jolly chevalier laughed as they met <\s>
<s> i'm an old soldier too he said <\s>
<s> i wanted to talk to you pendennis <\s>
<s> i have heard of all that has happened and all the chops and changes that have taken place during my absence <\s>
<s> i congratulate you on your marriage and i congratulate you on your escape too you understand me <\s>
<s> it was not my business to speak but i know this that a certain party is as arrant a little well well never mind what <\s>
<s> you acted like a man and a trump and are well out of it <\s>
<s> i have no reason to complain said pen <\s>
<s> i went back to beg and entreat poor blanche to tell foker all i hope for her sake she will but i fear not <\s>
<s> there is but one policy strong there is but one <\s>
<s> and lucky he that can stick to it said the chevalier <\s>
<s> that rascal morgan means mischief <\s>
<s> he has been lurking about our chambers for the last two months he has found out that poor mad devil amory's secret <\s>
<s> he has been trying to discover where he was he has been pumping mr <\s>
<s> bolton and making old costigan drunk several times <\s>
<s> he bribed the inn porter to tell him when we came back and he has got into clavering's service on the strength of his information <\s>
<s> he will get very good pay for it mark my words the villain <\s>
<s> at boulogne i believe <\s>
<s> i left him there and warned him not to come back <\s>
<s> i have broken with him after a desperate quarrel such as one might have expected with such a madman <\s>
<s> and i'm glad to think that he is in my debt now and that i have been the means of keeping him out of more harms than one <\s>
<s> he has lost all his winnings i suppose said pen <\s>
<s> no he is rather better than when he went away or was a fortnight ago <\s>
<s> he had extraordinary luck at baden broke the bank several nights and was the fable of the place <\s>
<s> he lied himself there with a fellow by the name of bloundell who gathered about him a society of all sorts of sharpers male and female russians germans french english <\s>
<s> amory got so insolent that i was obliged to thrash him one day within an inch of his life <\s>
<s> i couldn't help myself the fellow has plenty of pluck and i had nothing for it but to hit out <\s>
<s> and did he call you out <\s>
<s> you think if i had shot him i should have done nobody any harm <\s>
<s> no sir i waited for his challenge but it never came and the next time i met him he begged my pardon and said strong i beg your pardon you whopped me and you served me right <\s>
<s> i shook hands but i couldn't live with him after that <\s>
<s> i paid him what i owed him the night before said strong with a blush i pawned everything to pay him and then i went with my last ten florins and had a shy at the roulette <\s>
<s> if i had lost i should have let him shoot me in the morning <\s>
<s> i was weary of my life <\s>
<s> by jove sir isn't it a shame that a man like me who may have had a few bills out but who never deserted a friend or did an unfair action shouldn't be able to turn his hand to anything to get bread <\s>
<s> i made a good night sir at roulette and i've done with that <\s>
<s> i'm going into the wine business <\s>
<s> my wife's relations live at cadiz <\s>
<s> i intend to bring over spanish wine and hams there's a fortune to be made by it sir a fortune here's my card <\s>
<s> if you want any sherry or hams recollect ned strong is your man <\s>
<s> and the chevalier pulled out a handsome card stating that strong and company shepherd's inn were sole agents of the celebrated diamond manzanilla of the duke of garbanzos grandee of spain of the first class and of the famous toboso hams fed on acorns only in the country of don quixote <\s>
<s> come and taste em sir come and try em at my chambers <\s>
<s> you see i've an eye to business and by jove this time i'll succeed <\s>
<s> pen laughed as he took the card <\s>
<s> i don't know whether i shall be allowed to go to bachelors parties he said <\s>
<s> you know i'm going to but you must have sherry sir <\s>
<s> you must have sherry <\s>
<s> i will have it from you depend on it said the other <\s>
<s> and i think you are very well out of your other partnership <\s>
<s> that worthy altamont and his daughter correspond i hear pen added after a pause <\s>
<s> yes she wrote him the longest rigmarole letters that i used to read the sly little devil and he answered under cover to mrs <\s>
<s> he was for carrying her off the first day or two and nothing would content him but having back his child <\s>
<s> but she didn't want to come as you may fancy and he was not very eager about it <\s>
<s> here the chevalier burst out in a laugh <\s>
<s> why sir do you know what was the cause of our quarrel and boxing match <\s>
<s> there was a certain widow at baden a madame la baronne de la cruche cassee who was not much better than himself and whom the scoundrel wanted to marry and would but that i told her he was married already <\s>
<s> i don't think that she was much better than he was <\s>
<s> i saw her on the pier at boulogne the day i came to england <\s>
<s> and now we have brought up our narrative to the point whither the announcement in the chatteris champion had already conducted us <\s>
<s> it wanted but very very few days before that blissful one when foker should call blanche his own the clavering folks had all pressed to see the most splendid new carriage in the whole world which was standing in the coach house at the clavering arms and shown in grateful return for drink commonly by mr <\s>
<s> madame fribsby was occupied in making some lovely dresses for the tenants daughters who were to figure as a sort of bridesmaids chorus at the breakfast and marriage ceremony <\s>
<s> and immense festivities were to take place at the park upon this delightful occasion <\s>
<s> huxter yes a happy tenantry its country's pride will assemble in the baronial hall where the beards will wag all <\s>
<s> the ox shall be slain and the cup they'll drain and the bells shall peal quite genteel and my father in law with the tear of sensibility bedewing his eye shall bless us at his baronial porch <\s>
<s> that shall be the order of proceedings i think mr <\s>
<s> huxter and i hope we shall see you and your lovely bride by her husband's side and what will you please to drink sir <\s>
<s> lightfoot madam you will give to my excellent friend and body surgeon mr <\s>
<s> samuel huxter m r c s every refreshment that your hostel affords and place the festive amount to my account and mr <\s>
<s> lightfoot sir what will you take <\s>
<s> though you've had enough already i think yes ha <\s>
<s> so spoke harry foker in the bar of the clavering arms <\s>
<s> he had apartments at that hotel and had gathered a circle of friends round him there <\s>
<s> he treated all to drink who came <\s>
<s> he was hail fellow with every man <\s>
<s> he was so happy <\s>
<s> he danced round madame fribsby mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot's great ally as she sate pensive in the bar <\s>
<s> lightfoot who had already begun to have causes of matrimonial disquiet for the truth must be told that young lightfoot having now the full command of the cellar had none over his own unbridled desires and was tippling and tipsy from morning till night <\s>
<s> and a piteous sight it was for his fond wife to behold the big youth reeling about the yard and coffee room or drinking with the farmers and tradesmen his own neat wines and carefully selected stock of spirits <\s>
<s> when he could find time mr <\s>
<s> morgan the butler came from the park and took a glass at the expense of the landlord of the clavering arms <\s>
<s> he watched poor lightfoot's tipsy vagaries with savage sneers <\s>
<s> lightfoot felt always doubly uncomfortable when her unhappy spouse was under his comrade's eye <\s>
<s> but a few months married and to think he had got to this <\s>
<s> madame fribsby could feel for her <\s>
<s> madame fribsby could tell her stories of men every bit as bad <\s>
<s> she had had her own woes too and her sad experience of men <\s>
<s> so it is that nobody seems happy altogether and that there's bitters as mr <\s>
<s> foker remarked in the cup of every man's life <\s>
<s> and yet there did not seem to be any in his the honest young fellow <\s>
<s> it was brimming over with happiness and good humour <\s>
<s> morgan was constant in his attentions to foker <\s>
<s> and yet i don't like him somehow said the candid young man to mrs <\s>
<s> he always seems as if he was measuring me for my coffin somehow <\s>
<s> pa in law's afraid of him pa in law's ahem <\s>
<s> never mind but ma in law's a trump mrs <\s>
<s> indeed my lady was and mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot owned with a sigh that perhaps it had been better for her had she never left her mistress <\s>
<s> no i do not like thee dr <\s>
<s> fell the reason why i cannot tell continued mr <\s>
<s> foker and he wants to be taken as my head man <\s>
<s> blanche wants me to take him <\s>
<s> why does miss amory like him so <\s>
<s> did miss blanche like him so <\s>
<s> the notion seemed to disturb mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot very much and there came to this worthy landlady another cause for disturbance <\s>
<s> a letter bearing the boulogne postmark was brought to her one morning and she and her husband were quarrelling over it as foker passed down the stairs by the bar on his way to the park <\s>
<s> his custom was to breakfast there and bask a while in the presence of armida then as the company of clavering tired him exceedingly and he did not care for sporting he would return for an hour or two to billiards and the society of the clavering arms then it would be time to ride with miss amory and after dining with her he left her and returned modestly to his inn <\s>
<s> lightfoot and his wife were quarrelling over the letter <\s>
<s> what was that letter from abroad <\s>
<s> why was she always having letters from abroad <\s>
<s> who wrote em he would know <\s>
<s> he didn't believe it was her brother <\s>
<s> it was no business of his <\s>
<s> it was a business of his and with a curse he seized hold of his wife and dashed at her pocket for the letter <\s>
<s> the poor woman gave a scream and said well take it <\s>
<s> just as her husband seized on the letter and mr <\s>
<s> foker entered at the door she gave another scream at seeing him and once more tried to seize the paper <\s>
<s> lightfoot opened it shaking her away and an enclosure dropped down on the breakfast table <\s>
<s> hands off man alive <\s>
<s> cried little harry springing in <\s>
<s> don't lay hands on a woman sir <\s>
<s> the man that lays his hand upon a woman save in the way of kindness is a hallo <\s>
<s> it's a letter for miss amory <\s>
<s> lightfoot began in piteous tones of reproach to her husband you unmanly <\s>
<s> to treat a woman so who took you off the street <\s>
<s> oh you coward to lay your hand upon your wife <\s>
<s> why did i marry you <\s>
<s> why did i leave my lady for you <\s>
<s> why did i spend eight hundred pound in fitting up this house that you might drink and guzzle <\s>
<s> she gets letters and she won't tell me who writes letters said mr <\s>
<s> lightfoot with a muzzy voice it's a family affair sir <\s>
<s> will you take anything sir <\s>
<s> i will take this letter to miss amory as i am going to the park said foker turning very pale and taking it up from the table which was arranged for the poor landlady's breakfast he went away <\s>
<s> he's comin' dammy who's a comin <\s>
<s> lightfoot curse me who's j <\s>
<s> lightfoot cried out be quiet you tipsy brute do and running to her bonnet and shawl threw them on saw mr <\s>
<s> foker walking down the street took the by lane which skirts it and ran as quickly as she could to the lodge gate clavering park <\s>
<s> foker saw a running figure before him but it was lost when he got to the lodge gate <\s>
<s> he stopped and asked who was that who had just come in <\s>
<s> he reeled almost in his walk the trees swam before him <\s>
<s> he rested once or twice against the trunks of the naked limes <\s>
<s> lady clavering was in the breakfast room with her son and her husband yawning over his paper <\s>
<s> good morning harry said the begum <\s>
<s> here's letters lots of letters lady rockminster will be here on tuesday instead of monday and arthur and the major come to day and laura is to go to dr <\s>
<s> portman's and come to church from there and what's the matter my dear <\s>
<s> what makes you so pale harry <\s>
<s> asked harry in a sickening voice not down yet <\s>
<s> blanche is always the last said the boy eating muffins she's a regular dawdle she is <\s>
<s> when you're not here she lays in bed till lunch time <\s>
<s> be quiet frank said the mother <\s>
<s> blanche came down presently looking pale and with rather an eager look towards foker then she advanced and kissed her mother and had a face beaming with her very best smiles on when she greeted harry <\s>
<s> how do you do sir <\s>
<s> she said and put out both her hands <\s>
<s> i'm ill answered harry <\s>
<s> i i've brought a letter for you blanche <\s>
<s> a letter and from whom is it pray <\s>
<s> i don't know i should like to know said foker <\s>
<s> how can i tell until i see it <\s>
<s> bonner not told you <\s>
<s> he said with a shaking voice there's some secret <\s>
<s> you give her the letter lady clavering <\s>
<s> lady clavering wondering took the letter from poor foker's shaking hand and looked at the superscription <\s>
<s> as she looked at it she too began to shake in every limb and with a scared face she dropped the letter and running up to frank clutched the boy to her and burst out with a sob take that away it's impossible it's impossible <\s>
<s> what is the matter <\s>
<s> cried blanche with rather a ghastly smile the letter is only from from a poor pensioner and relative of ours <\s>
<s> it's not true it's not true screamed lady clavering <\s>
<s> no my frank is it clavering <\s>
<s> blanche had taken up the letter and was moving with it towards the fire but foker ran to her and clutched her arm i must see that letter he said give it me <\s>
<s> you shan't burn it <\s>
<s> you you shall not treat miss amory so in my house cried the baronet give back the letter by jove <\s>
<s> read it and look at her blanche cried pointing to her mother it it was for her i kept the secret <\s>
<s> read it cruel man <\s>
<s> and foker opened and read the letter i have not wrote my darling betsy this three weeks but this is to give her a father's blessing and i shall come down pretty soon as quick as my note and intend to see the ceremony and my son in law <\s>
<s> i shall put up at bonner's <\s>
<s> i have had a pleasant autumn and am staying here at an hotel where there is good company and which is kep in good style <\s>
<s> i don't know whether i quite approve of your throwing over mr <\s>
<s> f and don't think foker's such a pretty name and from your account of him he seems a muff and not a beauty <\s>
<s> but he has got the rowdy which is the thing <\s>
<s> so no more my dear little betsy till we meet from your affectionate father j <\s>
<s> read it lady clavering it is too late to keep it from you now said poor foker and the distracted woman having cast her eyes over it again broke out into hysterical screams and convulsively grasped her son <\s>
<s> they have made an outcast of you my boy she said <\s>
<s> they've dishonoured your old mother but i'm innocent frank before god i'm innocent <\s>
<s> i didn't know this mr <\s>
<s> foker indeed indeed i didn't <\s>
<s> i'm sure you didn't said foker going up and kissing her hand <\s>
<s> cried out blanche in an ecstasy <\s>
<s> but he withdrew his hand which was upon her side and turned from her with a quivering lip <\s>
<s> that's different he says <\s>
<s> it was for her sake for her sake harry <\s>
<s> again miss amory is in an attitude <\s>
<s> there was something to be done for mine said foker <\s>
<s> i would have taken you whatever you were <\s>
<s> everything's talked about in london <\s>
<s> i knew that your father had come to to grief <\s>
<s> you don't think it was it was for your connexion i married you <\s>
<s> i've loved you with all my heart and soul for two years and you've been playing with me and cheating me broke out the young man with a cry <\s>
<s> oh blanche blanche it's a hard thing a hard thing <\s>
<s> and he covered his face with his hands and sobbed behind them <\s>
<s> blanche thought why didn't i tell him that night when arthur warned me <\s>
<s> don't refuse her harry cried out lady clavering <\s>
<s> take her take everything i have <\s>
<s> it's all hers you know at my death <\s>
<s> this boy's disinherited master frank who had been looking as scared at the strange scene here burst into a loud cry take every shilling <\s>
<s> give me just enough to live and to go and hide my head with this child and to fly from both <\s>
<s> oh they've both been bad bad men <\s>
<s> perhaps he's here now <\s>
<s> don't let me see him <\s>
<s> clavering you coward defend me from him <\s>
<s> clavering started up at this proposal <\s>
<s> you ain't serious jemima <\s>
<s> you don't mean that <\s>
<s> you won't throw me and frank over <\s>
<s> i didn't know it so help me <\s>
<s> foker i'd no more idea of it than the dead until the fellow came and found me out the d  d escaped convict scoundrel <\s>
<s> blanche gave a scream <\s>
<s> yes screamed out the baronet in his turn yes a d  d runaway convict a fellow that forged his father in law's name a d  d attorney and killed a fellow in botany bay hang him and ran into the bush curse him i wish he'd died there <\s>
<s> and he came to me a good six years ago and robbed me and i've been ruining myself to keep him the infernal scoundrel <\s>
<s> and pendennis knows it and strong knows it and that d  d morgan knows it and she knows it ever so long and i never would tell it never and i kept it from my wife <\s>
<s> and you saw him and you didn't kill him clavering you coward <\s>

<s> come away frank your father's a coward <\s>
<s> i am dishonoured but i'm your old mother and you'll you'll love me won't you <\s>
<s> blanche eploree went up to her mother but lady clavering shrank from her with a sort of terror <\s>
<s> don't touch me she said you've no heart you never had <\s>
<s> i see all now <\s>
<s> i see why that coward was going to give up his place in parliament to arthur yes that coward <\s>

<s> come away frank my darling come to your poor old mother <\s>
<s> we'll hide ourselves but we're honest yes we are honest <\s>
<s> all this while a strange feeling of exultation had taken possession of blanche's mind <\s>
<s> that month with poor harry had been a weary month to her <\s>
<s> all his fortune and splendour scarcely sufficed to make the idea of himself supportable <\s>
<s> she was wearied of his simple ways and sick of coaxing and cajoling him <\s>
<s> stay mamma stay madam <\s>
<s> she cried out with a gesture which was always appropriate though rather theatrical i have no heart have i <\s>
<s> i keep the secret of my mother's shame <\s>
<s> i give up my rights to my half brother and my bastard brother yes my rights and my fortune <\s>

<s> i desire to go to my father <\s>
<s> and the little lady swept round her hand and thought that she was a heroine <\s>
<s> you will will you <\s>
<s> cried out clavering with one of his usual oaths <\s>
<s> i'm a magistrate and dammy i'll commit him <\s>
<s> here's a chaise coming perhaps it's him <\s>
<s> a chaise was indeed coming up the avenue and the two women shrieked each their loudest expecting at that moment to see altamont arrive <\s>
<s> the door opened and mr <\s>
<s> morgan announced major pendennis and mr <\s>
<s> pendennis who entered and found all parties engaged in this fierce quarrel <\s>
<s> a large screen fenced the breakfast room from the hall and it is probable that according to his custom mr <\s>
<s> morgan had taken advantage of the screen to make himself acquainted with all that occurred <\s>
<s> it had been arranged on the previous day that the young people should ride and at the appointed hour in the afternoon mr <\s>
<s> foker's horses arrived from the clavering arms <\s>
<s> but miss blanche did not accompany him on this occasion <\s>
<s> pen came out and shook hands with him on the door steps and harry foker rode away followed by his groom in mourning <\s>
<s> the whole transactions which have occupied the most active part of our history were debated by the parties concerned during those two or three hours <\s>
<s> many counsels had been given stories told and compromises suggested and at the end harry foker rode away with a sad god bless you <\s>
<s> there was a dreary dinner at clavering park at which the lately installed butler did not attend and the ladies were both absent <\s>
<s> after dinner pen said i will walk down to clavering and see if he is come <\s>
<s> and he walked through the dark avenue across the bridge and road by his own cottage the once quiet and familiar fields of which were flaming with the kilns and forges of the artificers employed on the new railroad works and so he entered the town and made for the clavering arms <\s>
<s> it was past midnight when he returned to clavering park <\s>
<s> he was exceedingly pale and agitated <\s>
<s> is lady clavering up yet <\s>
<s> yes she was in her own sitting room <\s>
<s> he went up to her and there found the poor lady in a piteous state of tears and agitation <\s>
<s> it is i arthur he said looking in and entering he took her hand very affectionately and kissed it <\s>
<s> you were always the kindest of friends to me dear lady clavering he said <\s>
<s> i love you very much <\s>
<s> i have got some news for you <\s>
<s> don't call me by that name she said pressing his hand <\s>
<s> you were always a good boy arthur and it's kind of you to come now very kind <\s>
<s> you sometimes look very like your ma my dear <\s>
<s> dear good lady clavering arthur repeated with particular emphasis something very strange has happened <\s>
<s> has anything happened to him <\s>
<s> oh it's horrid to think i should be glad of it horrid <\s>
<s> he has been and is gone my dear lady <\s>
<s> don't alarm yourself he is gone and you are lady clavering still <\s>
<s> what he sometimes said to me she screamed out that he he was married before he married you said pen <\s>
<s> he has confessed it to night <\s>
<s> he will never come back <\s>
<s> there came another shriek from lady clavering as she flung her arms round pen and kissed him and burst into tears on his shoulder <\s>
<s> what pen had to tell through a multiplicity of sobs and interruptions must be compressed briefly for behold our prescribed limit is reached and our tale is coming to its end <\s>
<s> with the branch coach from the railroad which had succeeded the old alacrity and perseverance amory arrived and was set down at the clavering arms <\s>
<s> he ordered his dinner at the place under his assumed name of altamont and being of a jovial turn he welcomed the landlord who was nothing loth to a share of his wine <\s>
<s> having extracted from mr <\s>
<s> lightfoot all the news regarding the family at the park and found from examining his host that mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot as she said had kept his counsel he called for more wine of mr <\s>
<s> lightfoot and at the end of this symposium both being greatly excited went into mrs <\s>
<s> she was there taking tea with her friend madame fribsby and lightfoot was by this time in such a happy state as not to be surprised at anything which might occur so that when altamont shook hands with mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot as an old acquaintance the recognition did not appear to him to be in the least strange but only a reasonable cause for further drinking <\s>
<s> the gentlemen partook then of brandy and water which they offered to the ladies not heeding the terrified looks of one or the other <\s>
<s> whilst they were so engaged at about six o'clock in the evening mr <\s>
<s> morgan sir francis clavering's new man came in and was requested to drink <\s>
<s> he selected his favourite beverage and the parties engaged in general conversation <\s>
<s> after a while mr <\s>
<s> lightfoot began to doze <\s>
<s> morgan had repeatedly given hints to mrs <\s>
<s> fribsby to quit the premises but that lady strangely fascinated and terrified it would seem or persuaded by mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot not to go kept her place <\s>
<s> her persistence occasioned much annoyance to mr <\s>
<s> morgan who vented his displeasure in such language as gave pain to mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot and caused mr <\s>
<s> altamont to say that he was a rum customer and not polite to the sex <\s>
<s> the altercation between the two gentlemen became very painful to the women especially to mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot who did everything to soothe mr <\s>
<s> morgan and under pretence of giving a pipe light to the stranger she handed him a paper on which she had privily written the words he knows you <\s>
<s> there may have been something suspicious in her manner of handing or in her guest's of reading the paper for when he got up a short time afterwards and said he would go to bed morgan rose too with a laugh and said it was too early to go to bed <\s>
<s> the stranger then said he would go to his bedroom <\s>
<s> morgan said he would show him the way <\s>
<s> at this the guest said come up <\s>
<s> i've got a brace of pistols up there to blow out the brains of any traitor or skulking spy and glared so fiercely upon morgan that the latter seizing hold of lightfoot by the collar and waking him said john amory i arrest you in the queen's name <\s>
<s> stand by me lightfoot <\s>
<s> this capture is worth a thousand pounds <\s>
<s> he put forward his hand as if to seize his prisoner but the other doubling his fist gave morgan with his left hand so fierce a blow on the chest that it knocked him back behind mr <\s>
<s> that gentleman who was athletic and courageous said he would knock his guest's head off and prepared to do so as the stranger tearing off his coat and cursing both of his opponents roared to them to come on <\s>
<s> but with a piercing scream mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot flung herself before her husband whilst with another and louder shriek madame fribsby ran to the stranger and calling out armstrong johnny armstrong <\s>
<s> seized hold of his naked arm on which a blue tattooing of a heart and m <\s>
<s> the ejaculation of madame fribsby seemed to astound and sober the stranger <\s>
<s> he looked down upon her and cried out it's polly by jove <\s>
<s> fribsby continued to exclaim this is not amory <\s>
<s> this is johnny armstrong my wicked wicked husband married to me in st <\s>
<s> martin's church mate on board an indiaman and he left me two months after the wicked wretch <\s>
<s> this is john armstrong here's the mark on his arm which he made for me <\s>
<s> the stranger said i am john armstrong sure enough polly <\s>
<s> i'm john armstrong amory altamont and let em all come on and try what they can do against a british sailor <\s>
<s> hurray who's for it <\s>
<s> morgan still called out arrest him <\s>
<s> lightfoot said arrest him <\s>
<s> arrest you you mean spy <\s>
<s> stop the marriage and ruin my lady and take away the clavering arms from us <\s>
<s> did he say he'd take away the clavering arms from us <\s>
<s> hang him i'll throttle him <\s>
<s> keep him darling till the coach passes to the up train <\s>
<s> it'll be here now directly <\s>
<s> d him i'll choke him if he stirs said lightfoot <\s>
<s> and so they kept morgan until the coach came and mr <\s>
<s> amory or armstrong went away back to london <\s>
<s> morgan had followed him but of this event arthur pendennis did not inform lady clavering and left her invoking blessings upon him at her son's door going to kiss him as he was asleep <\s>
<s> it had been a busy day <\s>
<s> we have to chronicle the events of but one day more and that was a day when mr <\s>
<s> arthur attired in a new hat a new blue frock coat and blue handkerchief in a new fancy waistcoat new boots and new shirt studs presented by the right honourable the countess dowager of rockminster made his appearance at a solitary breakfast table in clavering park where he could scarce eat a single morsel of food <\s>
<s> two letters were laid by his worship's plate and he chose to open the first which was in a round clerk like hand in preference to the second more familiar superscription <\s>
<s> note 1 ran as follows garbanzos wine company shepherd's inn monday <\s>
<s> my dear pendennis in congratulating you heartily upon the event which is to make you happy for life i send my very kindest remembrances to mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis whom i hope to know even longer than i have already known her <\s>
<s> and when i call her attention to the fact that one of the most necessary articles to her husband's comfort is pure sherry i know i shall have her for a customer for your worship's sake <\s>
<s> but i have to speak to you of other than my own concerns <\s>
<s> yesterday afternoon a certain j <\s>
<s> arrived at my chambers from clavering which he had left under circumstances of which you are doubtless now aware <\s>
<s> in spite of our difference i could not but give him food and shelter and he partook freely both of the garbanzos amontillado and the toboso ham and he told me what had happened to him and many other surprising adventures <\s>
<s> the rascal married at sixteen and has repeatedly since performed that ceremony in sydney in new zealand in south america in newcastle he says first before he knew our poor friend the milliner <\s>
<s> he is a perfect don juan <\s>
<s> and it seemed as if the commendatore had at last overtaken him for as we were at our meal there came three heavy knocks at my outer door which made our friend start <\s>
<s> i have sustained a siege or two here and went to my usual place to reconnoitre <\s>
<s> thank my stars i have not a bill out in the world and besides those gentry do not come in that way <\s>
<s> i found that it was your uncle's late valet morgan and a policeman i think a sham policeman and they said they had a warrant to take the person of john armstrong alias amory alias altamont a runaway convict and threatened to break in the oak <\s>
<s> now sir in my own days of captivity i had discovered a little passage along the gutter into bows and costigan's window and i sent jack alias along this covered way not without terror of his life for it had grown very cranky and then after a parley let in mons <\s>
<s> the rascal had been instructed about that covered way for he made for the room instantly telling the policeman to go downstairs and keep the gate and he charged up my little staircase as if he had known the premises <\s>
<s> as he was going out of the window we heard a voice that you know from bows's garret saying who are ye and hwhat the divvle are ye at <\s>
<s> you'd betther leave the gutther bedad there's a man killed himself already <\s>
<s> and as morgan crossing over and looking into the darkness was trying to see whether this awful news was true he took a broomstick and with a vigorous dash broke down the pipe of communication and told me this morning with great glee that he was reminded of that aisy sthratagem by remembering his dorling emilie when she acted the pawrt of cora in the plee and by the bridge in pezawro bedad <\s>
<s> i wish that scoundrel morgan had been on the bridge when the general tried his sthratagem <\s>
<s> if i hear more of jack alias i will tell you <\s>
<s> he has got plenty of money still and i wanted him to send some to our poor friend the milliner but the scoundrel laughed and said he had no more than he wanted but offered to give anybody a lock of his hair <\s>
<s> and believe me always truly yours e <\s>
<s> and now for the other letter said pen <\s>
<s> and he kissed the seal before he broke it <\s>
<s> i must not let the day pass over without saying a god bless you to both of you <\s>
<s> may heaven make you happy dear arthur and dear laura <\s>
<s> i think pen that you have the best wife in the world and pray that as such you will cherish her and tend her <\s>
<s> the chambers will be lonely without you dear pen but if i am tired i shall have a new home to go to in the house of my brother and sister <\s>
<s> i am practising in the nursery here in order to prepare for the part of uncle george <\s>
<s> make your wedding tour and come back to your affectionate g <\s>
<s> pendennis and his wife read this letter together after doctor portman's breakfast was over and the guests were gone and when the carriage was waiting amidst the crowd at the doctor's outer gate <\s>
<s> but the wicket led into the churchyard of st <\s>
<s> mary's where the bells were pealing with all their might and it was here over helen's green grass that arthur showed his wife george's letter <\s>
<s> for which of those two for grief was it or for happiness that laura's tears abundantly fell on the paper <\s>
<s> and once more in the presence of the sacred dust she kissed and blessed her arthur <\s>
<s> there was only one marriage on that day at clavering church for in spite of blanche's sacrifices for her dearest mother honest harry foker could not pardon the woman who had deceived her husband and justly argued that she would deceive him again <\s>
<s> he went to the pyramids and syria and there left his malady behind him and returned with a fine beard and a supply of tarbooshes and nargillies with which he regales all his friends <\s>
<s> he lives splendidly and through pen's mediation gets his wine from the celebrated vintages of the duke of garbanzos <\s>
<s> as for poor cos his fate has been mentioned in an early part of this story <\s>
<s> no very glorious end could be expected to such a career <\s>
<s> morgan is one of the most respectable men in the parish of st <\s>
<s> james's and in the present political movement has pronounced himself like a man and a briton <\s>
<s> and bows on the demise of mr <\s>
<s> piper who played the organ at clavering little mrs <\s>
<s> sam hunter who has the entire command of doctor portman brought bows down from london to contest the organ loft and her candidate carried the chair <\s>
<s> when sir francis clavering quitted this worthless life the same little indefatigable canvasser took the borough by storm and it is now represented by arthur pendennis esq <\s>
<s> blanche amory it is well known married at paris and the saloons of madame la comtesse de montmorenci de valentinois were amongst the most suivis of that capital <\s>
<s> the duel between the count and the young and fiery representative of the mountain alcide de mirobo arose solely from the latter questioning at the club the titles borne by the former nobleman <\s>
<s> madame de montmorenci de valentinois travelled after the adventure and bungay bought her poems and published them with the countess's coronet emblazoned on the countess's work <\s>
<s> major pendennis became very serious in his last days and was never so happy as when laura was reading to him with her sweet voice or listening to his stories <\s>
<s> for this sweet lady is the friend of the young and the old and her life is always passed in making other lives happy <\s>
<s> and what sort of a husband would this pendennis be <\s>
<s> many a reader will ask doubting the happiness of such a marriage and the fortune of laura <\s>
<s> the querists if they meet her are referred to that lady herself who seeing his faults and wayward moods seeing and owning that there are men better than he loves him always with the most constant affection <\s>
<s> his children or their mother have never heard a harsh word from him and when his fits of moodiness and solitude are over welcome him back with a never failing regard and confidence <\s>
<s> his friend is his friend still entirely heart whole <\s>
<s> that malady is never fatal to a sound organ <\s>
<s> and george goes through his part of godpapa perfectly and lives alone <\s>
<s> pen's works have procured him more reputation than has been acquired by his abler friend whom no one knows george lives contented without the fame <\s>
<s> if the best men do not draw the great prizes in life we know it has been so settled by the ordainer of the lottery <\s>
<s> we own and see daily how the false and worthless live and prosper while the good are called away and the dear and young perish untimely we perceive in every man's life the maimed happiness the frequent falling the bootless endeavour the struggle of right and wrong in which the strong often succumb and the swift fail we see flowers of good blooming in foul places as in the most lofty and splendid fortunes flaws of vice and meanness and stains of evil and knowing how mean the best of us is let us give a hand of charity to arthur pendennis with all his faults and shortcomings who does not claim to be a hero but only a man and a brother <\s>
